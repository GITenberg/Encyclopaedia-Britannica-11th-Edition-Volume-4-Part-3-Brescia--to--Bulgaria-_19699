  <p>... volumes x.-xiv., the preface to vol. xi. containing important
  researches into the French communes. To the <i>Table chronologique des
  diplômes, chartes, lettres, et actes imprimés concernant l'histoire de
  France</i> he contributed three volumes in collaboration with Mouchet
  (1769-1783). Charged with the supervision of a large collection of
  documents bearing on French history, analogous to Rymer's <i>Foedera</i>,
  he published the first volume (<i>Diplomatat. Chartae</i>, &amp;c.,
  1791). The Revolution interrupted him in his collection of <i>Mémoires
  concernant l'histoire, les sciences, les lettres, et les arts des
  Chinois</i>, begun in 1776 at the instance of the minister Bertin, when
  fifteen volumes had appeared.</p>

  <p>(C. B.*)</p>

  <p><b>BRESCIA</b> (anc. <i>Brixia</i>), a city and episcopal see of
  Lombardy, Italy, the capital of the province of Brescia, finely situated
  at the foot of the Alps, 52 m. E. of Milan and 40 m. W. of Verona by
  rail. Pop. (1901) town, 42,495; commune, 72,731. The plan of the city is
  rectangular, and the streets intersect at right angles, a peculiarity
  handed down from Roman times, though the area enclosed by the medieval
  walls is larger than that of the Roman town, which occupied the eastern
  portion of the present one. The Piazza del Museo marks the site of the
  forum, and the museum on its north side is ensconced in a Corinthian
  temple with three <i>cellae</i>, by some attributed to Hercules, but more
  probably the Capitolium of the city, erected by Vespasian in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 73 (if the inscription really belongs to the
  building; cf. Th. Mommsen in <i>Corp. Inscrip. Lat.</i> v. No. 4312,
  Berlin, 1872), and excavated in 1823. It contains a famous bronze statue
  of Victory, found in 1826. Scanty remains of a building on the south side
  of the forum, called the <i>curia</i>, but which may be a basilica, and
  of the theatre, on the east of the temple, still exist.</p>

  <p>Brescia contains many interesting medieval buildings. The castle, at
  the north-east angle of the town, commands a fine view. It is now a
  military prison. The old cathedral is a round domed structure of the 10th
  (?) century erected over an early Christian basilica, which has forty-two
  ancient columns; and the Broletto, adjoining the new cathedral (a
  building of 1604) on the north, is a massive building of the 12th and
  13th centuries (the original town hall, now the prefecture and law
  courts), with a lofty tower. There are also remains of the convent of S.
  Salvatore, founded by Desiderius, king of Lombardy, including three
  churches, two of which now contain the fine medieval museum, which
  possesses good ivories. The church of S. Francesco has a Gothic façade
  and cloisters. There are also some good Renaissance palaces and other
  buildings, including the Municipio, begun in 1492 and completed by Jacopo
  Sansovino in 1554-1574. This is a magnificent structure, with fine
  ornamentation. The church of S. Maria dei Miracoli (1488-1523) is also
  noteworthy for its general effect and for the richness of its details,
  especially of the reliefs on the façade. Many other churches, and the
  picture gallery (Galleria Martinengo), contain fine works of the painters
  of the Brescian school, Alessandro Bonvicino (generally known as
  Moretto), Girolamo Romanino and Moretto's pupil, Giovanni Battista
  Moroni. The Biblioteca Queriniana contains early MSS., a 14th-century MS.
  of Dante, &amp;c., and some rare incunabula. The city is well supplied
  with water, and has no less than seventy-two public fountains. Brescia
  has considerable factories of iron ware, particularly fire-arms and
  weapons (one of the government small arms factories being situated here),
  also of woollens, linens and silks, matches, candles, &amp;c. The stone
  quarries of Mazzano, 8 m. east of Brescia, supplied material for the
  monument to Victor Emmanuel II. and other buildings in Rome. Brescia is
  situated on the main railway line between Milan and Verona, and has
  branch railways to Iseo, Parma, Cremona and (via Rovato) to Bergamo, and
  steam tramways to Mantua, Soncino, Ponte Toscolano and Cardone
  Valtrompia.</p>

  <p>The ancient Celtic Brixia, a town of the Cenomani, became Roman in 225
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the Cenomani submitted to Rome.
  Augustus founded a civil (not a military) colony here in 27 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and he and Tiberius constructed an aqueduct to
  supply it. In 452 it was plundered by Attila, but was the seat of a duchy
  in the Lombard period. From 1167 it was one of the most active members of
  the Lombard League. In 1258 it fell into the hands of Eccelino of Verona,
  and belonged to the Scaligers (della Scala) until 1421, when it came
  under the Visconti of Milan, and in 1426 under Venice. Early in the 16th
  century it was one of the wealthiest cities of Lombardy, but has never
  recovered from its sack by the French under Gaston de Foix in 1512. It
  belonged to Venice until 1797, when it came under Austrian dominion; it
  revolted in 1848, and again in 1849, being the only Lombard town to rally
  to Charles Albert in the latter year, but was taken after ten days'
  obstinate street fighting by the Austrians under Haynau.</p>

  <p><b>BRESLAU</b> (Polish <i>Wraclaw</i>), a city of Germany, capital of
  the Prussian province of Silesia, and an episcopal see, situated in a
  wide and fertile plain on both banks of the navigable Oder, 350 m. from
  its mouth, at the influx of the Ohle, and 202 m. from Berlin on the
  railway to Vienna. Pop. (1867) 171,926; (1880) 272,912; (1885) 299,640;
  (1890) 335,186; (1905) 470,751, about 60% being Protestants, 35% Roman
  Catholics and nearly 5% Jews. The Oder, which here breaks into several
  arms, divides the city into two unequal halves, crossed by numerous
  bridges. The larger portion, on the left bank, includes the old or inner
  town, surrounded by beautiful promenades, on the site of the ramparts,
  dismantled after 1813, from an eminence within which, the Liebichs Höhe,
  a fine view is obtained of the surrounding country. Outside, as well as
  across the Oder, lies the new town with extensive suburbs, containing,
  especially in the Schweidnitz quarter in the south, and the Oder quarter
  in the north, many handsome streets and spacious squares. The inner town,
  in contrast to the suburbs, still retains with its narrow streets much of
  its ancient characters, and contains several medieval buildings, both
  religious and secular, of great beauty and interest. The cathedral,
  dedicated to St John the Baptist, was begun in 1148 and completed at the
  close of the 15th century, enlarged in the 17th and 18th centuries, and
  restored between 1873 and 1875; it is rich in notable treasures,
  especially the high altar of beaten silver, and in beautiful paintings
  and sculptures. The Kreuzkirche (church of the Holy Cross), dating from
  the 13th and 14th centuries, is an interesting brick building, remarkable
  for its stained glass and its historical monuments, among which is the
  tomb of Henry IV., duke of Silesia. The Sandkirche, so called from its
  dedication to Our Lady on the Sand, dates from the 14th century, and was
  until 1810 the church of the Augustinian canons. The Dorotheenor
  Minoritenkirche, remarkable for its high-pitched roof, was founded by the
  emperor Charles IV. in 1351. These are the most notable of the Roman
  Catholic churches. Of the Evangelical churches the most important is that
  of St Elizabeth, founded about 1250, rebuilt in the 14th and 15th
  centuries, and restored in 1857. Its lofty tower contains the largest
  bell in Silesia, and the church possesses a celebrated organ, fine
  stained glass, a magnificent stone pyx (erected in 1455) over 52 ft.
  high, and portraits of Luther and Melanchthon by Lucas Cranach. The
  church of St Mary Magdalen, built in the 14th century on the model of the
  cathedral, has two lofty Gothic towers connected by a bridge, and is
  interesting as having been the church in which, in 1523, the reformation
  in Silesia was first proclaimed. Other noteworthy ecclesiastical
  buildings are the graceful Gothic church of St Michael built in 1871, the
  bishop's palace and the Jewish synagogue, the finest in Germany after
  that in Berlin.</p>

  <p>The business streets of the city converge upon the Ring, the market
  square, in which is the town-hall, a fine Gothic building, begun in the
  middle of the 14th and completed in the 16th century. Within is the
  Fürstensaal, in which the diets of Silesia were formerly held, while
  beneath is the famous Schweidnitzer Keller, used continuously since 1355
  as a beer and wine house. <!-- Page 499 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page499"></a>[v.04 p.0499]</span>The university, a spacious Gothic
  building facing the Oder, is a striking edifice. It was built (1728-1736)
  as a college by the Jesuits, on the site of the former imperial castle
  presented to them by the emperor Leopold I., and contains a magnificent
  hall (Aula Leopoldina), richly ornamented with frescoes and capable of
  holding 1200 persons. Breslau possesses a large number of other important
  public buildings: the Stadthaus (civic hall), the royal palace, the
  government offices (a handsome pile erected in 1887), the provincial
  House of Assembly, the municipal archives, the courts of law, the
  Silesian museum of arts and crafts and antiquities, stored in the former
  assembly hall of the estates (Ständehaus), which was rebuilt for the
  purpose, the museum of fine arts, the exchange, the Stadt and Lobe
  theatres, the post office and central railway station. There are also
  numerous hospitals and schools. Breslau is exceedingly rich in fine
  monuments; the most noteworthy being the equestrian statues of Frederick
  the Great and Frederick William III., both by Kiss; the statue of Blücher
  by Rauch; a marble statue of General Tauentzien by Langhans and Schadow;
  a bronze statue of Karl Gottlieb Svarez (1746-1798), the Prussian jurist,
  a monument to Schleiermacher, born here in 1768, and statues of the
  emperor William I., Bismarck and Moltke. There are also several handsome
  fountains. Foremost among the educational establishments stands the
  university, founded in 1702 by the emperor Leopold I. as a Jesuit
  college, and greatly extended by the incorporation of the university of
  Frankfort-on-Oder in 1811. Its library contains 306,000 volumes and 4000
  MSS., and has in the so-called <i>Bibliotheca Habichtiana</i> a valuable
  collection of oriental literature. Among its auxiliary establishments are
  botanical gardens, an observatory, and anatomical, physiological and
  kindred institutions. There are eight classical and four modern schools,
  two higher girls' schools, a Roman Catholic normal school, a Jewish
  theological seminary, a school of arts and crafts, and numerous literary
  and charitable foundations. It is, however, as a commercial and
  industrial city that Breslau is most widely known. Its situation, close
  to the extensive coal and iron fields of Upper Silesia, in proximity to
  the Austrian and Russian frontiers, at the centre of a network of
  railways directly communicating both with these countries and with the
  chief towns of northern and central Germany, and on a deep waterway
  connecting with the Elbe and the Vistula, facilitates its very
  considerable transit and export trade in the products of the province and
  of the neighbouring countries. These embrace coal, sugar, cereals,
  spirits, petroleum and timber. The local industries comprise machinery
  and tools, railway and tramway carriages, furniture, cast-iron goods,
  gold and silver work, carpets, furs, cloth and cottons, paper, musical
  instruments, glass and china. Breslau is the headquarters of the VI.
  German army corps and contains a large garrison of troops of all
  arms.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Breslau (Lat. <i>Vratislavia</i>) is first
  mentioned by the chronicler Thietmar, bishop of Merseburg, in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1000, and was probably founded some years before
  this date. Early in the 11th century it was made the seat of a bishop,
  and after having formed part of Poland, became the capital of an
  independent duchy in 1163. Destroyed by the Mongols in 1241, it soon
  recovered its former prosperity and received a large influx of German
  colonists. The bishop obtained the title of a prince of the Empire in
  1290.<a name="FnAnchor_011" href="#Footnote_011"><sup>[1]</sup></a> When
  Henry VI., the last duke of Breslau, died in 1335, the city came by
  purchase to John, king of Bohemia, whose successors retained it until
  about 1460. The Bohemian kings bestowed various privileges on Breslau,
  which soon began to extend its commerce in all directions, while owing to
  increasing wealth the citizens took up a more independent attitude.
  Disliking the Hussites, Breslau placed itself under the protection of
  Pope Pius II. in 1463, and a few years afterwards came under the rule of
  the Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. After his death in 1490 it again
  became subject to Bohemia, passing with the rest of Silesia to the
  Habsburgs when in 1526 Ferdinand, afterwards emperor, was chosen king of
  Bohemia. Having passed almost undisturbed through the periods of the
  Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, Breslau was compelled to own the
  authority of Frederick the Great in 1741. It was, however, <span
  class="correction" title="'recoverd' in original">recovered</span> by the
  Austrians in 1757, but was regained by Frederick after his victory at
  Leuthen in the same year, and has since belonged to Prussia, although it
  was held for a few days by the French in 1807 after the battle of Jena,
  and again in 1813 after the battle of Bautzen. The sites of the
  fortifications, dismantled by the French in 1807, were given to the civic
  authorities by King Frederick William III., and converted into
  promenades. In March 1813 this monarch issued from Breslau his stirring
  appeals to the Prussians, <i>An mein Volk</i> and <i>An mein
  Kriegesheer</i>, and the city was the centre of the Prussian preparations
  for the campaign which ended at Leipzig. After the Prussian victory at
  Sadowa in 1866, William I. made a triumphant and complimentary entry into
  the city, which since the days of Frederick the Great has been only less
  loyal to the royal house than Berlin itself.</p>

  <p><b>BRESSANT, JEAN BAPTISTE PROSPER</b> (1815-1886), French actor, was
  born at Chalon-sur-Saône on the 23rd of October 1815, and began his stage
  career at the Variétés in Paris in 1833. In 1838 he went to the French
  theatre at St Petersburg, where for eight years he played important parts
  with ever-increasing reputation. His success was confirmed at the Gymnase
  when he returned to Paris in 1846, and he made his <i>début</i> at the
  Comédie Française as a full-fledged <i>sociétaire</i> in 1854. From
  playing the ardent young lover, he turned to leading rôles both in modern
  plays and in the classical répertoire. His Richelieu in <i>Mlle de
  Belle-Isle</i>, his Octave in Alfred de Musset's <i>Les Caprices de
  Marianne</i>, and his appearance in de Musset's <i>Il faut qu'une porte
  soit ouverte ou fermée</i> and <i>Un caprice</i> were followed by
  <i>Tartuffe</i>, <i>Le Misanthrope</i> and <i>Don Juan</i>. Bressant
  retired in 1875, and died on the 23rd of January 1886. During his
  professorship at the Conservatoire, Mounet-Sully was one of his
  pupils.</p>

  <p><b>BRESSE,</b> a district of eastern France embracing portions of the
  departments of Ain, Saône-et-Loire and Jura. The Bresse extends from the
  Dombes on the south to the river Doubs on the north, and from the Saône
  eastwards to the Jura, measuring some 60 m. in the former, and 20 m. in
  the latter direction. It is a plain varying from 600 to 800 ft. above the
  sea, with few eminences and a slight inclination westwards. Heaths and
  coppice alternate with pastures and arable land; pools and marshes are
  numerous, especially in the north. Its chief rivers are the Veyle, the
  Reyssouze and the Seille, all tributaries of the Saône. The soil is a
  gravelly clay but moderately fertile, and cattle-raising is largely
  carried on. The region is, however, more especially celebrated for its
  table poultry. The inhabitants preserve a distinctive but almost obsolete
  costume, with a curious head-dress. The Bresse proper, called the
  <i>Bresse Bressane</i>, comprises the northern portion of the department
  of Ain. The greater part of the district belonged in the middle ages to
  the lords of Bâgé, from whom it passed in 1272 to the house of Savoy. It
  was not till the first half of the 15th century that the province, with
  Bourg as its capital, was founded as such. In 1601 it was ceded to France
  by the treaty of Lyons, after which it formed (together with the province
  of Bugey) first a separate government and afterwards part of the
  government of Burgundy.</p>

  <p><b>BRESSUIRE,</b> a town of western France, capital of an
  arrondissement in the department of Deux-Sèvres, 48 m. N. of Niort by
  rail. Pop. (1906) 4561. The town is situated on an eminence overlooking
  the Dolo, a tributary of the Argenton. It is the centre of a
  cattle-rearing and agricultural region, and has important markets; the
  manufacture of wooden type and woollen goods is carried on. Bressuire has
  two buildings of interest: the church of Notre-Dame, which, dating
  chiefly from the 12th and 15th centuries, has an imposing tower of the
  Renaissance period; and the castle, built by the lords of <!-- Page 500
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page500"></a>[v.04
  p.0500]</span>Beaumont, vassals of the viscount of Thouars. The latter is
  now in ruins, and a portion of the site is occupied by a modern château,
  but an inner and outer line of fortifications are still to be seen. The
  whole forms the finest assemblage of feudal ruins in Poitou. Bressuire is
  the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of first instance. Among the
  disasters suffered at various times by the town, its capture from the
  English and subsequent pillage by French troops under du Guesclin in 1370
  is the most memorable.</p>

  <p><b>BREST,</b> a fortified seaport of western France, capital of an
  arrondissement in the department of Finistère, 155 m. W.N.W. of Rennes by
  rail. Population (1906) town, 71,163; commune, 85,294. It is situated to
  the north of a magnificent landlocked bay, and occupies the slopes of two
  hills divided by the river Penfeld,&mdash;the part of the town on the
  left bank being regarded as Brest proper, while the part on the right is
  known as Recouvrance. There are also extensive suburbs to the east of the
  town. The hill-sides are in some places so steep that the ascent from the
  lower to the upper town has to be effected by flights of steps and the
  second or third storey of one house is often on a level with the ground
  storey of the next. The chief street of Brest bears the name of rue de
  Siam, in honour of the Siamese embassy sent to Louis XIV., and terminates
  at the remarkable swing-bridge, constructed in 1861, which crosses the
  mouth of the Penfeld. Running along the shore to the south of the town is
  the Cours d'Ajot, one of the finest promenades of its kind in France,
  named after the engineer who constructed it. It is planted with trees and
  adorned with marble statues of Neptune and Abundance by Antoine Coysevox.
  The castle with its donjon and seven towers (12th to the 16th centuries),
  commanding the entrance to the river, is the only interesting building in
  the town. Brest is the capital of one of the five naval arrondissements
  of France. The naval port, which is in great part excavated in the rock,
  extends along both banks of the Penfeld; it comprises gun-foundries and
  workshops, magazines, shipbuilding yards and repairing docks, and employs
  about 7000 workmen. There are also large naval barracks, training ships
  and naval schools of various kinds, and an important naval hospital.
  Brest is the seat of a sub-prefect and has tribunals of first instance
  and of commerce, a chamber of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, two
  naval tribunals, and a tribunal of maritime commerce. There are also
  lycées for boys and girls and a school of commerce and industry. The
  commercial port, which is separated from the town itself by the Cours
  d'Ajot, comprises a tidal port with docks and an outer harbour; it is
  protected by jetties to the east and west and by a breakwater on the
  south. In 1905 the number of vessels entered was 202 with a tonnage of
  67,755, and cleared 160 with a tonnage of 61,012. The total value of the
  imports in 1905 was £244,000. The chief were wine, coal, timber, mineral
  tar, fertilizers and lobsters and crayfish. Exports, of which the chief
  were wheat-flour, fruit and superphosphates, were valued at £40,000.
  Besides its sardine and mackerel fishing industry, the town has
  flour-mills, breweries, foundries, forges, engineering works, and
  manufactures of blocks, candles, chemicals (from sea-weed), boots, shoes
  and linen. Brest communicates by submarine cable with America and French
  West Africa. The roadstead consists of a deep indentation with a maximum
  length of 14 m. and an average width of 4 m., the mouth being barred by
  the peninsula of Quélern, leaving a passage from 1 to 2 m. broad, known
  as the Goulet. The outline of the bay is broken by numerous smaller bays
  or arms, formed by the embouchures of streams, the most important being
  the Anse de Quélern, the Anse de Poulmie, and the mouths of the
  Châteaulin and the Landerneau. Brest is a fortress of the first class.
  The fortifications of the town and the harbour fall into four groups: (1)
  the very numerous forts and batteries guarding the approaches to and the
  channel of the Goulet; (2) the batteries and forts directed upon the
  roads; (3) a group of works preventing access to the peninsula of Quélern
  and commanding the ground to the south of the peninsula from which many
  of the works of group (2) could be taken in reverse; (4) the defences of
  Brest itself, consisting of an old-fashioned <i>enceinte</i> possessing
  little military value and a chain of detached forts to the west of the
  town.</p>

  <p>Nothing definite is known of Brest till about 1240, when it was ceded
  by a count of Léon to John I., duke of Brittany. In 1342 John of Montfort
  gave it up to the English, and it did not finally leave their hands till
  1397. Its medieval importance was great enough to give rise to the
  saying, "He is not duke of Brittany who is not lord of Brest." By the
  marriage of Francis I. with Claude, daughter of Anne of Brittany, Brest
  with the rest of the duchy definitely passed to the French crown. The
  advantages of the situation for a seaport town were first recognized by
  Richelieu, who in 1631 constructed a harbour with wooden wharves, which
  soon became a station of the French navy. Colbert changed the wooden
  wharves for masonry and otherwise improved the post, and Vauban's
  fortifications followed in 1680-1688. During the 18th century the
  fortifications and the naval importance of the town continued to develop.
  In 1694 an English squadron under John, 3rd Lord Berkeley, was miserably
  defeated in attempting a landing; but in 1794, during the revolutionary
  war, the French fleet, under Villaret de Joyeuse, was as thoroughly
  beaten in the same place by the English admiral Howe.</p>

  <p><b>BREST-LITOVSK</b> (Polish <i>Brzesc-Litevski</i>; and in the Chron.
  <i>Berestie</i> and <i>Berestov</i>), a strongly fortified town of
  Russia, in the government of Grodno, 137 m. by rail S. from the city of
  Grodno, in 52° 5&prime; N. lat. and 23° 39&prime; E. long., at the
  junction of the navigable river Mukhovets with the Bug, and at the
  intersection of railways from Warsaw, Kiev, Moscow and East Prussia. Pop.
  (1867) 22,493; (1901) 42,812, of whom more than one-half were Jews. It
  contains a Jewish synagogue, which was regarded in the 16th century as
  the first in Europe, and is the seat of an Armenian and of a Greek
  Catholic bishop; the former has authority over the Armenians throughout
  the whole country. The town carries on an extensive trade in grain, flax,
  hemp, wood, tar and leather. First mentioned in the beginning of the 11th
  century, Brest-Litovsk was in 1241 laid waste by the Mongols and was not
  rebuilt till 1275; its suburbs were burned by the Teutonic Knights in
  1379; and in the end of the 15th century the whole town met a similar
  fate at the hands of the khan of the Crimea. In the reign of the Polish
  king Sigismund III. diets were held there; and in 1594 and 1596 it was
  the meeting-place of two remarkable councils of the bishops of western
  Russia. In 1657, and again in 1706, the town was captured by the Swedes;
  in 1794 it was the scene of Suvarov's victory over the Polish general
  Sierakowski; in 1795 it was added to the Russian empire. The
  Brest-Litovsk or King's canal (50 m. long), utilizing the Mukhovets-Bug
  rivers, forms a link in the waterways that connect the Dnieper with the
  Vistula.</p>

  <p><b>BRETEUIL, LOUIS CHARLES AUGUSTE LE TONNELIER,</b> <span
  class="sc">Baron de</span> (1730-1807), French diplomatist, was born at
  the chateau of Azay-le-Féron (Indre) on the 7th of March 1730. He was
  only twenty-eight when he was appointed by Louis XV. ambassador to the
  elector of Cologne, and two years later he was sent to St Petersburg. He
  arranged to be temporarily absent from his post at the time of the palace
  revolution by which Catherine II. was placed on the throne. In 1769 he
  was sent to Stockholm, and subsequently represented his government at
  Vienna, Naples, and again at Vienna until 1783, when he was recalled to
  become minister of the king's household. In this capacity he introduced
  considerable reforms in prison administration. A close friend of Marie
  Antoinette, he presently came into collision with Calonne, who demanded
  his dismissal in 1787. His influence with the king and queen, especially
  with the latter, remained unshaken, and on Necker's dismissal on the 11th
  of July 1789, Breteuil succeeded him as chief minister. The fall of the
  Bastille three days later put an end to the new ministry, and Breteuil
  made his way to Switzerland with the first party of <i>émigrés</i>. At
  Soleure, in November 1790, he received from Louis XVI. exclusive powers
  to negotiate with the European courts, and in his efforts to check the
  ill-advised diplomacy of the <i>émigré</i> princes, he soon brought
  himself into opposition with his old rival Calonne, who held a chief
  place in their councils. <!-- Page 501 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page501"></a>[v.04 p.0501]</span>After the failure of the flight to
  Varennes, in the arrangement of which he had a share, Breteuil received
  instructions from Louis XVI., designed to restore amicable relations with
  the princes. His distrust of the king's brothers and his defence of Louis
  XVI.'s prerogative were to some extent justified, but his intransigeant
  attitude towards these princes emphasized the dissensions of the royal
  family in the eyes of foreign sovereigns, who looked on the comte de
  Provence as the natural representative of his brother and found a pretext
  for non-interference on Louis's behalf in the contradictory statements of
  the negotiators. Breteuil himself was the object of violent attacks from
  the party of the princes, who asserted that he persisted in exercising
  powers which had been revoked by Louis XVI. After the execution of Marie
  Antoinette he retired into private life near Hamburg, only returning to
  France in 1802. He died in Paris on the 2nd of November 1807.</p>

  <p><b>BRÉTIGNY,</b> a French town (dept. Eure-et-Loir, arrondissement and
  canton of Chartres, commune of Sours), which gave its name to a
  celebrated treaty concluded there on the 8th of May 1360, between Edward
  III. of England and John II., surnamed the Good, of France. The exactions
  of the English, who wished to yield as few as possible of the advantages
  claimed by them in the treaty of London, made negotiations difficult, and
  the discussion of terms begun early in April lasted more than a month. By
  virtue of this treaty Edward III. obtained, besides Guienne and Gascony,
  Poitou, Saintonge and Aunis, Agenais, Périgord, Limousin, Quercy,
  Bigorre, the countship of Gaure, Angoumois, Rouergue, Montreuil-sur-mer,
  Ponthieu, Calais, Sangatte, Ham and the countship of Guines. John II.
  had, moreover, to pay three millions of gold crowns for his ransom. On
  his side the king of England gave up the duchies of Normandy and
  Touraine, the countships of Anjou and Maine, and the suzerainty of
  Brittany and of Flanders. As a guarantee for the payment of his ransom,
  John the Good gave as hostages two of his sons, several princes and
  nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the
  nineteen principal towns of France. This treaty was ratified and sworn to
  by the two kings and by their eldest sons on the 24th of October 1360, at
  Calais. At the same time were signed the special conditions relating to
  each important article of the treaty, and the renunciatory clauses in
  which the kings abandoned their rights over the territory they had
  yielded to one another.</p>

  <p><b>BRETON, JULES ADOLPHE AIMÉ LOUIS</b> (1827- ), French painter, was
  born on the 1st of May 1827, at Courrières, Pas de Calais, France. His
  artistic gifts being manifest at an early age, he was sent in 1843 to
  Ghent, to study under the historical painter de Vigne, and in 1846 to
  Baron Wappers at Antwerp. Finally he worked in Paris under Drolling. His
  first efforts were in historical subjects: "Saint Piat preaching in
  Gaul"; then, under the influence of the revolution of 1848, he
  represented "Misery and Despair." But Breton soon discovered that he was
  not born to be a historical painter, and he returned to the memories of
  nature and of the country which were impressed on him in early youth. In
  1853 he exhibited the "Return of the Harvesters" at the Paris Salon, and
  the "Little Gleaner" at Brussels. Thenceforward he was essentially a
  painter of rustic life, especially in the province of Artois, which he
  quitted only three times for short excursions: in 1864 to Provence, and
  in 1865 and 1873 to Brittany, whence he derived some of his happiest
  studies of religious scenes. His numerous subjects may be divided
  generally into four classes: labour, rest, rural festivals and religious
  festivals. Among his more important works may be named "Women Gleaning,"
  and "The Day after St Sebastian's Day" (1855), which gained him a
  third-class medal; "Blessing the Fields" (1857), a second-class medal;
  "Erecting a Calvary" (1859), now in the Lille gallery; "The Return of the
  Gleaners" (1859), now in the Luxembourg; "Evening" and "Women Weeding"
  (1861), a first-class medal; "Grandfather's Birthday" (1862); "The Close
  of Day" (1865); "Harvest" (1867); "Potato Gatherers" (1868); "A Pardon,
  Brittany" (1869); "The Fountain" (1872), medal of honour; "The Bonfires
  of St John" (1875); "Women mending Nets" (1876), in the Douai museum; "A
  Gleaner" (1877), Luxembourg; "Evening, Finistère" (1881); "The Song of
  the Lark" (1884); "The Last Sunbeam" (1885); "The Shepherd's Star"
  (1888); "The Call Home" (1889); "The Last Gleanings" (1895); "Gathering
  Poppies" (1897); "The Alarm Cry" (1899); "Twilight Glory" (1900). Breton
  was elected to the Institut in 1886 on the death of Baudry. In 1889 he
  was made commander of the Legion of Honour, and in 1899 foreign member of
  the Royal Academy of London. He also wrote several books, among them
  <i>Les Champs et la mer</i> (1876), <i>Nos peintres du siècle</i> (1900),
  "Jeanne," a poem, <i>Delphine Bernard</i> (1902), and <i>La Peinture</i>
  (1904).</p>

  <p><b>BRETON, BRITTON or BRITTAINE, NICHOLAS</b> (1545?-1626), English
  poet, belonged to an old family settled at Layer-Breton, Essex. His
  father, William Breton, who had made a considerable fortune by trade,
  died in 1559, and the widow (née Elizabeth Bacon) married the poet George
  Gascoigne before her sons had attained their majority. Nicholas Breton
  was probably born at the "capitall mansion house" in Red Cross Street, in
  the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate, mentioned in his father's
  will. There is no official record of his residence at the university, but
  the diary of the Rev. Richard Madox tells us that he was at Antwerp in
  1583 and was "once of Oriel College." He married Ann Sutton in 1593, and
  had a family. He is supposed to have died shortly after the publication
  of his last work, <i>Fantastickes</i> (1626). Breton found a patron in
  Mary, countess of Pembroke, and wrote much in her honour until 1601, when
  she seems to have withdrawn her favour. It is probably safe to supplement
  the meagre record of his life by accepting as autobiographical some of
  the letters signed N.B. in <i>A Poste with a Packet of Mad Letters</i>
  (1603, enlarged 1637); the 19th letter of the second part contains a
  general complaint of many griefs, and proceeds as follows: "hath another
  been wounded in the warres, fared hard, lain in a cold bed many a bitter
  storme, and beene at many a hard banquet? all these have I; another
  imprisoned? so have I; another long been sicke? so have I; another
  plagued with an unquiet life? so have I; another indebted to his hearts
  griefe, and fame would pay and cannot? so am I." Breton was a facile
  writer, popular with his contemporaries, and forgotten by the next
  generation. His work consists of religious and pastoral poems, satires,
  and a number of miscellaneous prose tracts. His religious poems are
  sometimes wearisome by their excess of fluency and sweetness, but they
  are evidently the expression of a devout and earnest mind. His praise of
  the Virgin and his references to Mary Magdalene have suggested that he
  was a Catholic, but his prose writings abundantly prove that he was an
  ardent Protestant. Breton had little gift for satire, and his best work
  is to be found in his pastoral poetry. His <i>Passionate Shepheard</i>
  (1604) is full of sunshine and fresh air, and of unaffected gaiety. The
  third pastoral in this book&mdash;"Who can live in heart so glad As the
  merrie country lad"&mdash;is well known; with some other of Breton's
  daintiest poems, among them the lullaby, "Come little babe, come silly
  soule,"<a name="FnAnchor_021"
  href="#Footnote_021"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&mdash;it is incorporated in A.H.
  Bullen's <i>Lyrics from Elizabethan Romances</i> (1890). His keen
  observation of country life appears also in his prose idyll, <i>Wits
  Trenchmour</i>, "a conference betwixt a scholler and an angler," and in
  his <i>Fantastickes</i>, a series of short prose pictures of the months,
  the Christian festivals and the hours, which throw much light on the
  customs of the times. Most of Breton's books are very rare and have great
  bibliographical value. His works, with the exception of some belonging to
  private owners, were collected by Dr A.B. Grosart in the <!-- Page 502
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page502"></a>[v.04

  introduction quoting the documents for the poet's history.</p>

  <p>Breton's poetical works, the titles of which are here somewhat
  abbreviated, include <i>The Workes of a Young Wit</i> (1577); <i>A
  Floorish upon Fancie</i> (1577); <i>The Pilgrimage to Paradise</i>
  (1592); <i>The Countess of Penbrook's Passion</i> (MS.), first printed by

  Humours</i> (1600); <i>Marie Magdalen's Love: a Solemne Passion of the
  Soules Love</i> (1595), the first part of which, a prose treatise, is
  probably by another hand; the second part, a poem in six-lined stanza, is
  certainly by Breton; <i>A Divine Poem</i>, including "The Ravisht Soul"
  and "The Blessed Weeper" (1601); <i>An Excellent Poem, upon the Longing

  at Stationers' Hall, 1594), only in part Breton's; and contributions to
  <i>England's Helicon</i> and other miscellanies of verse. Of his

  <p><b>BRETÓN DE LOS HERREROS, MANUEL</b> (1796-1873), Spanish dramatist,
  was born at Quel (Logroño) on the 19th of December 1796 and was educated
  at Madrid. Enlisting on the 24th of May 1812, he served against the
  French in Valencia and Catalonia, and retired with the rank of corporal
  on the 8th of March 1822. He obtained a minor post in the civil service
  under the liberal government, and on his discharge determined to earn his
  living by writing for the stage. His first piece, <i>Á la vejez
  viruelas</i>, was produced on the 14th of October 1824, and proved the
  writer to be the legitimate successor of the younger Moratin. His
  industry was astonishing: between October 1824 and November 1828, he
  composed thirty-nine plays, six of them original, the rest being
  translations or recasts of classic masterpieces. In 1831 he published a
  translation of Tibullus, and acquired by it an unmerited reputation for
  scholarship which secured for him an appointment as sub-librarian at the
  national library. But the theatre claimed him for its own, and with the
  exception of <i>Elena</i> and a few other pieces in the fashionable
  romantic vein, his plays were a long series of successes. His only
  serious check occurred in 1840; the former liberal had grown conservative
  with age, and in <i>La Ponchada</i> he ridiculed the National Guard. He
  was dismissed from the national library, and for a short time was so
  unpopular that he seriously thought of emigrating to America; but the
  storm blew over, and within two years Bretón de los Herreros had regained
  his supremacy on the stage. He became secretary to the Spanish Academy,
  quarrelled with his fellow-members, and died at Madrid on the 8th of
  November 1873. He is the author of some three hundred and sixty original
  plays, twenty-three of which are in prose. No Spanish dramatist of the
  nineteenth century approaches him in comic power, in festive invention,
  and in the humorous presentation of character, while his metrical
  dexterity is unique. <i>Marcela o a cual de los trés?</i> (1831),
  <i>Muérete; y verás!</i> (1837) and <i>La Escuela del matrimonio</i>
  (1852) still hold the stage, and are likely to hold it so long as Spanish
  is spoken.</p>

  <p><b>BRETSCHNEIDER, KARL GOTTLIEB</b> (1776-1848), German scholar and
  theologian, was born at Gersdorf in Saxony. In 1794 he entered the
  university of Leipzig, where he studied theology for four years. After
  some years of hesitation he resolved to be ordained, and in 1802 he
  passed with great distinction the examination for <i>candidatus
  theologiae</i>, and attracted the regard of F.V. Reinhard, author of the
  <i>System der christlichen Moral</i> (1788-1815), then court-preacher at
  Dresden, who became his warm friend and patron during the remainder of
  his life. In 1804-1806 Bretschneider was <i>Privat-docent</i> at the
  university of Wittenberg, where he lectured on philosophy and theology.
  During this time he wrote his work on the development of dogma,
  <i>Systematische Entwickelung aller in der Dogmatik vorkommenden Begriffe
  nach den symbolischen Schriften der evangelisch-lutherischen und
  reformirten Kirche</i> (1805, 4th ed. 1841), which was followed by
  others, including an edition of Ecclesiasticus with a Latin commentary.
  On the advance of the French army under Napoleon into Prussia, he
  determined to leave Wittenberg and abandon his university career. Through
  the good offices of Reinhard, he became pastor of Schneeberg in Saxony
  (1807). In 1808 he was promoted to the office of superintendent of the
  church of Annaberg, in which capacity he had to decide, in accordance
  with the canon law of Saxony, many matters belonging to the department of
  ecclesiastical law. But the climate did not agree with him, and his
  official duties interfered with his theological studies. With a view to a
  change he took the degree of doctor of theology in Wittenberg in August
  1812. In 1816 he was appointed general superintendent at Gotha, where he
  remained until his death in 1848. This was the great period of his
  literary activity.</p>

  <p>In 1820 was published his treatise on the gospel of St John, entitled
  <i>Probabilia de Evangelii el Epistolarum Joannis Apostoli indole et
  origine</i>, which attracted much attention. In it he collected with
  great fulness and discussed with marked moderation the arguments against
  Johannine authorship. This called forth a number of replies. To the
  astonishment of every one, Bretschneider announced in the preface to the
  second edition of his <i>Dogmatik</i> in 1822, that he had never doubted
  the authenticity of the gospel, and had published his <i>Probabilia</i>
  only to draw attention to the subject, and to call forth a more complete
  defence of its genuineness. Bretschneider remarks in his autobiography
  that the publication of this work had the effect of preventing his
  appointment as successor to Karl C. Tittmann in Dresden, the minister
  Detlev von Einsiedel (1773-1861) denouncing him as the "slanderer of
  John" (<i>Johannisschänder</i>). His greatest contribution to the science
  of exegesis was his <i>Lexicon Manuale Graeco-Latinum in libros Novi
  Testamenti</i> (1824, 3rd ed. 1840). This work was valuable for the use
  which its author made of the Greek of the Septuagint, of the Old and New
  Testament Apocrypha, of Josephus, and of the apostolic fathers, in
  illustration of the language of the New Testament. In 1826 he published
  <i>Apologie der neuern Theologie des evangelischen Deutschlands</i>. Hugh
  James Rose had published in England (1825) a volume of sermons on the
  rationalist movement (<i>The State of the Protestant Religion in
  Germany</i>), in which he classed Bretschneider with the rationalists;
  and Bretschneider contended that he himself was not a rationalist in the
  ordinary sense of the term, but a "rational supernaturalist." Some of his
  numerous dogmatic writings passed through several editions. An English
  translation of his <i>Manual of the Religion and History of the Christian
  Church</i> appeared in 1857. His dogmatic position seems to be
  intermediate between the extreme school of naturalists, such as Heinrich
  Paulus, J.F. Röhr and Julius Wegscheider on the one hand, and D.F.
  Strauss and F.C. Baur on the other. Recognizing a supernatural element in
  the Bible, he nevertheless allowed to the full the critical exercise of
  reason in the interpretation of its dogmas (cp. Otto Pfleiderer,
  <i>Development of Theology</i>, pp. 89 ff.).</p>

  <p><b>BRETTEN,</b> a town of Germany, in the grand duchy of Baden, on the
  Saalbach, 9 m. S.E. of Bruchsal by rail. Pop. (1900) 4781. It has some
  manufactories of machinery and japanned goods, and a considerable trade
  in timber and livestock. Bretten was the birthplace of Melanchthon
  (1497), and in addition to a <!-- Page 503 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  his famous contemporaries, has been erected.</p>

  <p><b>BRETWALDA,</b> a word used in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
  under the date 827, and also in a charter of Æthelstan, king of the
  English. It appears in several variant forms (<i>brytenwalda</i>,
  <i>bretenanwealda</i>, &amp;c.), and means most probably "lord of the
  Britons" or "lord of Britain"; for although the derivation of the word is
  uncertain, its earlier syllable seems to be cognate with the words Briton
  and Britannia. In the <i>Chronicle</i> the title is given to Ecgbert,
  king of the English, "the eighth king that was Bretwalda," and
  retrospectively to seven kings who ruled over one or other of the English
  kingdoms. The seven names are copied from Bede's <i>Historia
  Ecclesiastica</i>, and it is interesting to note that the last king
  named, Oswiu of Northumbria, lived 150 years before Ecgbert. It has been
  assumed that these seven kings exercised a certain superiority over a
  large part of England, but if such superiority existed it is certain that
  it was extremely vague and was unaccompanied by any unity of
  organization. Another theory is that Bretwalda refers to a
  war-leadership, or <i>imperium</i>, over the English south of the Humber,
  and has nothing to do with Britons or Britannia. In support of this
  explanation it is urged that the title is given in the <i>Chronicle</i>
  to Ecgbert in the year in which he "conquered the kingdom of the Mercians
  and all that was south of the Humber." Less likely is the theory of
  Palgrave that the Bretwaldas were the successors of the pseudo-emperors,
  Maximus and Carausius, and claimed to share the imperial dignity of Rome;
  or that of Kemble, who derives Bretwalda from the British word
  <i>breotan</i>, to distribute, and translates it "widely ruling." With
  regard to Ecgbert the word is doubtless given as a title in imitation of
  its earlier use, and the same remark applies to its use in Æthelstan's
  charter.</p>

  <p><b>BREUGHEL</b> (or <span class="sc">Brueghel</span>), <b>PIETER,</b>
  Flemish painter, was the son of a peasant residing in the village of
  Breughel near Breda. After receiving instruction in painting from Koek,
  whose daughter he married, he spent some time in France and Italy, and
  then went to Antwerp, where he was elected into the Academy in 1551. He
  finally settled at Brussels and died there. The subjects of his pictures
  are chiefly humorous figures, like those of D. Teniers; and if he wants
  the delicate touch and silvery clearness of that master, he has abundant
  spirit and comic power. He is said to have died about the year 1570 at
  the age of sixty; other accounts give 1590 as the date of his death.</p>

  <p>His son <span class="sc">Pieter</span>, the younger (1564-1637), known
  as "Hell" Breughel, was born in Brussels and died at Antwerp, where his
  "Christ bearing the Cross" is in the museum.</p>

  <p>Another son <span class="sc">Jan</span> (<i>c.</i> 1569-1642), known
  as "Velvet" Breughel, was born at Brussels. He first applied himself to
  painting flowers and fruits, and afterwards acquired considerable
  reputation by his landscapes and sea-pieces. After residing long at
  Cologne he travelled into Italy, where his landscapes, adorned with small
  figures, were greatly admired. He left a large number of pictures,
  chiefly landscapes, which are executed with great skill. Rubens made use
  of Breughel's hand in the landscape part of several of his small
  pictures&mdash;such as his "Vertumnus and Pomona," the "Satyr viewing the
  Sleeping Nymph," and the "Terrestrial Paradise."</p>

  <p><b>BREVET</b> (a diminutive of the Fr. <i>bref</i>), a short writing,
  originally an official writing or letter, with the particular meaning of
  a papal indulgence. The use of the word is mainly confined to a
  commission, or official document, giving to an officer in the army a
  permanent, as opposed to a local and temporary, rank in the service
  higher than that he holds substantively in his corps. In the British army
  "brevet rank" exists only above the rank of captain, but in the United
  States army it is possible to obtain a brevet as first lieutenant. In
  France the term <i>breveté</i> is particularly used with respect to the
  General Staff, to express the equivalent of the English "passed Staff
  College" (p.s.c.).</p>

  <p><b>BREVIARY</b> (Lat. <i>breviarium</i>, abridgment, epitome), the
  book which contains the offices for the canonical hours, <i>i.e.</i> the
  daily service of the Roman Catholic Church. As compared with the Anglican
  Book of Common Prayer it is both more and less comprehensive; more, in
  that it includes lessons and hymns for every day in the year; less,
  because it excludes the Eucharistic office (contained in the Missal), and
  the special offices connected with baptism, marriage, burial, ordination,
  &amp;c., which are found in the Ritual or the Pontifical. In the early
  days of Christian worship, when Jewish custom was followed, the Bible
  furnished all that was thought necessary, containing as it did the books
  from which the lessons were read and the psalms that were recited. The
  first step in the evolution of the Breviary was the separation of the
  Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church
  (bishop) or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he
  thought appropriate. From about the 4th century certain psalms began to
  be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic
  practice of daily reciting the 150 psalms. This took so much time that
  the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours,
  and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the
  6th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly,
  on the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is
  the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter
  choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or
  short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and
  metrical compositions. Jean Beleth, a 12th-century liturgical author,
  gives the following list of books necessary for the right conduct of the
  canonical office:&mdash;the <i>Antiphonarium</i>, the Old and New
  Testaments, the <i>Passionarius</i> (<i>liber</i>) and the
  <i>Legendarius</i> (dealing respectively with martyrs and saints), the
  <i>Homiliarius</i> (homilies on the Gospels), the <i>Sermologus</i>
  (collection of sermons) and the works of the Fathers, besides, of course,
  the <i>Psalterium</i> and the <i>Collectarium</i>. To overcome the
  inconvenience of using such a library the Breviary came into existence
  and use. Already in the 8th century Prudentius, bishop of Troyes, had in
  a <i>Breviarium Psalterii</i> made an abridgment of the Psalter for the
  laity, giving a few psalms for each day, and Alcuin had rendered a
  similar service by including a prayer for each day and some other
  prayers, but no lessons or homilies. The Breviary rightly so called,
  however, only dates from the 11th century; the earliest MS. containing
  the whole canonical office is of the year 1099 and is in the Mazarin
  library. Gregory VII. (pope 1073-1085), too, simplified the liturgy as
  performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of
  Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of
  view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of
  several works into one. There are several extant specimens of
  12th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III. (pope
  1198-1216) their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and
  active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization
  of Gregory IX., adopted (with some modifications, <i>e.g.</i> the
  substitution of the "Gallican" for the "Roman" version of the Psalter)
  the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it
  gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books (Legendaries,
  Responsories), &amp;c., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like
  that of Sarum. Finally, Nicholas III. (pope 1277-1280) adopted this
  version both for the curia and for the basilicas of Rome, and thus made
  its position secure. The Benedictines and Dominicans have Breviaries of
  their own. The only other types that merit notice are:&mdash;(1) the
  Mozarabic Breviary, once in use throughout all Spain, but now confined to
  a single foundation at Toledo; it is remarkable for the number and length
  of its hymns, and for the fact that the majority of its collects are
  addressed to God the Son; (2) the Ambrosian, now confined to Milan, where
  it owes its retention to the attachment of the clergy and people to their
  traditionary rites, which they derive from St Ambrose (see <span
  class="sc">Liturgy</span>).</p>

<p><!-- Page 504 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page504"></a>[v.04 p.0504]</span></p>

  <p>Till the council of Trent every bishop had full power to regulate the
  Breviary of his own diocese; and this was acted upon almost everywhere.
  Each monastic community, also, had one of its own. Pius V. (pope
  1566-1572), however, while sanctioning those which could show at least
  200 years of existence, made the Roman obligatory in all other places.
  But the influence of the court of Rome has gradually gone much beyond
  this, and has superseded almost all the local "uses." The Roman has thus
  become nearly universal, with the allowance only of additional offices
  for saints specially venerated in each particular diocese. The Roman
  Breviary has undergone several revisions: The most remarkable of these is
  that by Francis Quignonez, cardinal of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (1536),
  which, though not accepted by Rome,<a name="FnAnchor_031"
  href="#Footnote_031"><sup>[1]</sup></a> formed the model for the still
  more thorough reform made in 1549 by the Church of England, whose daily
  morning and evening services are but a condensation and simplification of
  the Breviary offices. Some parts of the prefaces at the beginning of the
  English Prayer-Book are free translations of those of Quignonez. The Pian
  Breviary was again altered by Sixtus V. in 1588, who introduced the
  revised Vulgate text; by Clement VIII. in 1602 (through Baronius and
  Bellarmine), especially as concerns the rubrics; and by Urban VIII.
  (1623-1644), a purist who unfortunately tampered with the text of the
  hymns, injuring both their literary charm and their historic worth.</p>

  <p>In the 17th and 18th centuries a movement of revision took place in
  France, and succeeded in modifying about half the Breviaries of that
  country. Historically, this proceeded from the labours of Jean de Launoy
  (1603-1678), "le dénicheur des saints," and Louis Sébastien le Nain de
  Tillemont, who had shown the falsity of numerous lives of the saints;
  while theologically it was produced by the Port Royal school, which led
  men to dwell more on communion with God as contrasted with the invocation
  of the saints. This was mainly carried out by the adoption of a rule that
  all antiphons and responses should be in the exact words of Scripture,
  which, of course, cut out the whole class of appeals to created beings.
  The services were at the same time simplified and shortened, and the use
  of the whole Psalter every week (which had become a mere theory in the
  Roman Breviary, owing to its frequent supersession by saints' day
  services) was made a reality. These reformed French
  Breviaries&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the Paris Breviary of 1680 by Archbishop
  François de Harlay (1625-1695) and that of 1736 by Archbishop Charles
  Gaspard Guillaume de Vintimille (1655-1746)&mdash;show a deep knowledge
  of Holy Scripture, and much careful adaptation of different texts; but
  during the pontificate of Pius IX. a strong Ultramontane movement arose
  against them. This was inaugurated by Montalembert, but its literary
  advocates were chiefly Dom Gueranger, a learned Benedictine monk, abbot
  of Solesmes, and Louis François Veuillot (1813-1883) of the
  <i>Univers</i>; and it succeeded in suppressing them everywhere, the last
  diocese to surrender being Orleans in 1875. The Jansenist and Gallican
  influence was also strongly felt in Italy and in Germany, where
  Breviaries based on the French models were published at Cologne, Münster,
  Mainz and other towns. Meanwhile, under the direction of Benedict XIV.
  (pope 1740-1758), a special congregation collected many materials for an
  official revision, but nothing was published. Subsequent changes have
  been very few and minute. In 1902, under Leo XIII., a commission under
  the presidency of Monsignor Louis Duchesne was appointed to consider the
  Breviary, the Missal, the Pontifical and the Ritual.</p>

  <p>The beauty and value of many of the Latin Breviaries were brought to
  the notice of English churchmen by one of the numbers of the Oxford
  <i>Tracts for the Times</i>, since which time they have been much more
  studied, both for their own sake and for the light they throw upon the
  English Prayer-Book.</p>

  <p>From a bibliographical point of view some of the early printed
  Breviaries are among the rarest of literary curiosities, being merely
  local. The copies were not spread far, and were soon worn out by the
  daily use made of them. Doubtless many editions have perished without
  leaving a trace of their existence, while others are known by unique
  copies. In Scotland the only one which has survived the convulsions of
  the 16th century is that of Aberdeen, a Scottish form of the Sarum
  Office,<a name="FnAnchor_032" href="#Footnote_032"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
  revised by William Elphinstone (bishop 1483-1514), and printed at
  Edinburgh by Walter Chapman and Andrew Myllar in 1509-1510. Four copies
  have been preserved of it, of which only one is complete; but it was
  reprinted in facsimile in 1854 for the Bannatyne Club by the munificence
  of the duke of Buccleuch. It is particularly valuable for the trustworthy
  notices of the early history of Scotland which are embedded in the lives
  of the national saints. Though enjoined by royal mandate in 1501 for
  general use within the realm of Scotland, it was probably never widely
  adopted. The new Scottish <i>Proprium</i> sanctioned for the Roman
  Catholic province of St Andrews in 1903 contains many of the old Aberdeen
  collects and antiphons.</p>

  <p>The Sarum or Salisbury Breviary itself was very widely used. The first
  edition was printed at Venice in 1483 by Raynald de Novimagio in folio;
  the latest at Paris, 1556, 1557. While modern Breviaries are nearly
  always printed in four volumes, one for each season of the year, the
  editions of the Sarum never exceeded two parts.</p>

  <p><i>Contents of the Roman Breviary</i>.&mdash;At the beginning stands
  the usual introductory matter, such as the tables for determining the
  date of Easter, the calendar, and the general rubrics. The Breviary
  itself is divided into four seasonal parts&mdash;winter, spring, summer,
  autumn&mdash;and comprises under each part (1) the Psalter; (2)
  <i>Proprium de Tempore</i> (the special office of the season); (3)
  <i>Proprium Sanctorum</i> (special offices of saints); (4) <i>Commune
  Sanctorum</i> (general offices for saints); (5) Extra Services. These
  parts are often published separately.</p>

  <p>1. <i>The Psalter</i>.&mdash;This is the very backbone of the
  Breviary, the groundwork of the Catholic prayer-book; out of it have
  grown the antiphons, responsories and versicles. In the Breviary the
  psalms are arranged according to a disposition dating from the 8th
  century, as follows. Psalms i.-cviii., with some omissions, are recited
  at Matins, twelve each day from Monday to Saturday, and eighteen on
  Sunday. The omissions are said at Lauds, Prime and Compline. Psalms
  cix.-cxlvii. (except cxvii., cxviii. and cxlii.) are said at Vespers,
  five each day. Psalms cxlviii.-cl. are always used at Lauds, and give
  that hour its name. The text of this Psalter is that commonly known as
  the Gallican. The name is misleading, for it is simply the second
  revision (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 392) made by Jerome of the old
  <i>Itala</i> version originally used in Rome. Jerome's first revision of
  the <i>Itala</i> (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 383), known as the
  Roman, is still used at St Peter's in Rome, but the "Gallican," thanks
  especially to St Gregory of Tours, who introduced it into Gaul in the 6th
  century, has ousted it everywhere else. The Antiphonary of Bangor proves
  that Ireland accepted the Gallican version in the 7th century, and the
  English Church did so in the 10th.</p>

  <p>2. The <i>Proprium de Tempore</i> contains the office of the seasons
  of the Christian year (Advent to Trinity), a conception that only
  gradually grew up. There is here given the whole service for every Sunday
  and week-day, the proper antiphons, responsories, hymns, and especially
  the course of daily Scripture-reading, averaging about twenty verses a
  day, and (roughly) arranged thus: for Advent, Isaiah; Epiphany to
  Septuagesima, Pauline Epistles; Lent, patristic homilies (Genesis on
  Sundays); Passion-tide, Jeremiah; Easter to Whitsun, Acts, Catholic
  epistles and Apocalypse; Whitsun to August, Samuel and Kings; August to
  Advent, Wisdom books, Maccabees, Prophets. The extracts are often scrappy
  and torn out of their context.</p>

  <p>3. The <i>Proprium Sanctorum</i> contains the lessons, psalms and
  liturgical formularies for saints' festivals, and depends on the days of
  the secular month. Most of the material here is hagiological biography,
  occasionally revised as by Leo XIII. in view of archaeological and other
  discoveries, but still largely uncritical. Covering a great stretch of
  time and space, they do for the worshipper in the field of church history
  what the Scripture readings do in that of biblical history. As something
  like 90% of the days in the year have, during the course of centuries,
  been allotted to some saint or other, it is easy to see how this section
  of the Breviary has encroached upon the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i>, and
  this is the chief problem that confronts any who are concerned for a
  revision of the Breviary.</p>

  <p>4. The <i>Commune Sanctorum</i> comprises psalms, antiphons, lessons,
  &amp;c., for feasts of various groups or classes (twelve in all);
  <i>e.g.</i> apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and the Blessed
  Virgin Mary. These offices are of very ancient date, and many of them
  were probably <!-- Page 505 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page505"></a>[v.04 p.0505]</span>in origin proper to individual
  saints. They contain passages of great literary beauty. The lessons read
  at the third nocturn are patristic homilies on the Gospels, and together
  form a rough summary of theological instruction.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Extra Services</i>.&mdash;Here are found the Little Office of
  the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Office of the Dead (obligatory on All Souls'
  Day), and offices peculiar to each diocese.</p>

  <p>It has already been indicated, by reference to Matins, Lauds, &amp;c.,
  that not only each day, but each part of the day, has its own office, the
  day being divided into liturgical "hours." A detailed account of these
  will be found in the article <span class="sc">Hours, Canonical</span>.
  Each of the hours of the office is composed of the same elements, and
  something must be said now of the nature of these constituent parts, of
  which mention has here and there been already made. They are: psalms
  (including canticles), antiphons, responsories, hymns, lessons, little
  chapters, versicles and collects.</p>

  <p>The <i>psalms</i> have already been dealt with, but it may be noted
  again how the multiplication of saints' festivals, with practically the
  same special psalms, tends in practice to constant repetition of about
  one-third of the Psalter, and correspondingly rare recital of the
  remaining two-thirds, whereas the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i>, could it be
  adhered to, would provide equal opportunities for every psalm. As in the
  Greek usage and in the Benedictine, certain canticles like the Song of
  Moses (Exodus xv.), the Song of Hannah (1 Sam. ii.), the prayer of
  Habakkuk (iii.), the prayer of Hezekiah (Isaiah xxxviii.) and other
  similar Old Testament passages, and, from the New Testament, the
  Magnificat, the Benedictus and the Nunc dimittis, are admitted as
  psalms.</p>

  <p>The <i>antiphons</i> are short liturgical forms, sometimes of
  biblical, sometimes of patristic origin, used to introduce a psalm. The
  term originally signified a chant by alternate choirs, but has quite lost
  this meaning in the Breviary.</p>

  <p>The <i>responsories</i> are similar in form to the antiphons, but come
  at the end of the psalm, being originally the reply of the choir or
  congregation to the precentor who recited the psalm.</p>

  <p>The <i>hymns</i> are short poems going back in part to the days of
  Prudentius, Synesius, Gregory of Nazianzus and Ambrose (4th and 5th
  centuries), but mainly the work of medieval authors. Together they make a
  fine collection, and it is a pity that Urban VIII. in his mistaken
  humanistic zeal tried to improve them.</p>

  <p>The <i>lessons</i>, as has been seen, are drawn variously from the
  Bible, the Acts of the Saints and the Fathers of the Church. In the
  primitive church, books afterwards excluded from the canon were often
  read, <i>e.g.</i> the letters of Clement of Rome and the <i>Shepherd of
  Hermas</i>. In later days the churches of Africa, having rich memorials
  of martyrdom, used them to supplement the reading of Scripture. Monastic
  influence accounts for the practice of adding to the reading of a
  biblical passage some patristic commentary or exposition. Books of
  homilies were compiled from the writings of SS. Augustine, Hilary,
  Athanasius, Isidore, Gregory the Great and others, and formed part of the
  library of which the Breviary was the ultimate compendium. In the
  lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks in upon the
  normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive
  reading. The lessons are read at Matins (which is subdivided into three
  nocturns).</p>

  <p>The <i>little chapters</i> are very short lessons read at the other
  "hours."</p>

  <p>The <i>versicles</i> are short responsories used after the little
  chapters.</p>

  <p>The <i>collects</i> come at the close of the office and are short
  prayers summing up the supplications of the congregation. They arise out
  of a primitive practice on the part of the bishop (local president),
  examples of which are found in the <i>Didach&#x113;</i> (Teaching of the
  Apostles) and in the letters of Clement of Rome and Cyprian. With the
  crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave
  place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later
  developed into Sacramentaries and Orationals. The collects of the
  Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries,
  and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in
  connexion with which they happen to be used.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of harmonizing the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i> and the
  <i>Proprium Sanctorum</i>, to which reference has been made, is only
  partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics. Additional
  help is given by a kind of Catholic Churchman's Almanack, called the
  <i>Ordo Recitandi Divini Officii</i>, published in different countries
  and dioceses, and giving, under every day, minute directions for proper
  reading.</p>

  <p>Every clerk in orders and every member of a religious order must
  publicly join in or privately read aloud (<i>i.e.</i> using the lips as
  well as the eyes&mdash;it takes about two hours in this way) the whole of
  the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches the
  services are usually grouped; <i>e.g.</i> Matins and Lauds (about 7.30
  <span class="scac">A.M.</span>); Prime, Terce (High Mass), Sext, and None
  (about 10 <span class="scac">A.M.</span>); Vespers and Compline (4 <span
  class="scac">P.M.</span>); and from four to eight hours (depending on the
  amount of music and the number of high masses) are thus spent in choir.
  Laymen do not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great
  extent.</p>

  <p>The Roman Breviary has been translated into English (by the marquess
  of Bute in 1879; new ed. with a trans, of the Martyrology, 1908), French
  and German. The English version is noteworthy for its inclusion of the
  skilful renderings of the ancient hymns by J.H. Newman, J.M. Neale and
  others.</p>

  <p><b>BREVIARY OF ALARIC</b> (<i>Breviarium Alaricanum</i>), a collection
  of Roman law, compiled by order of Alaric II., king of the Visigoths,
  with the advice of his bishops and nobles, in the twenty-second year of
  his reign (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 506). It comprises sixteen
  books of the Theodosian code; the Novels of Theodosius II., Valentinian
  III., Marcian, Majorianus and Severus; the Institutes of Gaius; five
  books of the <i>Sententiae Receptae</i> of Julius Paulus; thirteen titles
  of the Gregorian code; two titles of the Hermogenian code; and a fragment
  of the first book of the <i>Responsa Papiniani</i>. It is termed a code
  (codex), in the certificate of Anianus, the king's referendary, but
  unlike the code of Justinian, from which the writings of jurists were
  excluded, it comprises both imperial constitutions (<i>leges</i>) and
  juridical treatises (<i>jura</i>). From the circumstance that the
  Breviarium has prefixed to it a royal rescript (<i>commonitorium</i>)
  directing that copies of it, certified under the hand of Anianus, should
  be received exclusively as law throughout the kingdom of the Visigoths,
  the compilation of the code has been attributed to Anianus by many
  writers, and it is frequently designated the Breviary of Anianus
  (Breviarium Aniani). The code, however, appears to have been known
  amongst the Visigoths by the title of "Lex Romana," or "Lex Theodosii,"
  and it was not until the 16th century that the title of "Breviarium" was
  introduced to distinguish it from a recast of the code, which was
  introduced into northern Italy in the 9th century for the use of the
  Romans in Lombardy. This recast of the Visigothic code has been preserved
  in a MS. known as the Codex Utinensis, which was formerly kept in the
  archives of the cathedral of Udine, but is now lost; and it was published
  in the 18th century for the first time by P. Canciani in his collection
  of ancient laws entitled <i>Barbarorum Leges Antiquae</i>. Another MS. of
  this Lombard recast of the Visigothic code was discovered by Hänel in the
  library of St Gall. The chief value of the Visigothic code consists in
  the fact that it is the only collection of Roman Law in which the five
  first books of the Theodosian code and five books of the <i>Sententiae
  Receptae</i> of Julius Paulus have been preserved, and until the
  discovery of a MS. in the chapter library in Verona, which contained the
  greater part of the Institutes of Gaius, it was the only work in which
  any portion of the institutional writings of that great jurist had come
  down to us.</p>

  <p>The most complete edition of the Breviarium will be found in the
  collection of Roman law published under the title of <i>Jus Civile
  Ante-Justinianum</i> (Berlin, 1815). See also G. Hänel's <i>Lex Romana
  Visigothorum</i> (Berlin, 1847-1849).</p>

  <p><b>BREWER, JOHN SHERREN</b> (1810-1879), English historian, was born
  in Norwich in 1810, the son of a Baptist schoolmaster. He was educated at
  Queen's College, Oxford, was ordained in the Church of England in 1837,
  and became chaplain to a central London workhouse. In 1839 he was
  appointed lecturer in classical literature at King's College, London, and
  in 1855 he became professor of English language and literature and
  lecturer in modern history, succeeding F.D. Maurice. Meanwhile from 1854
  onwards he was also engaged in journalistic work on the <i>Morning
  Herald</i>, <i>Morning Post</i> and <i>Standard</i>. In 1856 he was
  commissioned by the master of the rolls to prepare a calendar of the
  state papers of Henry VIII., a work demanding a vast amount of research.
  He was also made reader at the Rolls, and subsequently preacher. In 1877
  Disraeli secured for him the crown living of Toppesfield, Essex. There he
  had time to continue his task of preparing his <i>Letters and Papers of
  the Reign of King Henry VIII</i>., the Introductions to which (published
  separately, under the title <i>The Reign of Henry VIII</i>., in 1884)
  form a scholarly and authoritative history of Henry VIII.'s reign. New
  editions of several standard historical works were also produced under
  Brewer's direction. He died at Toppesfield in February 1879.</p>

  <p><b>BREWING,</b> in the modern acceptation of the term, a series of
  operations the object of which is to prepare an alcoholic beverage of a
  certain kind&mdash;to wit, beer&mdash;mainly from cereals (chiefly malted
  barley), hops and water. Although the art of preparing beer (<i>q.v.</i>)
  or ale is a very ancient one, there is very little information in the
  literature of the subject as to the apparatus and methods employed in
  early times. It seems fairly certain, however, that up to the 18th
  century these were of the most primitive kind. With regard to
  <i>materials</i>, we know that prior to the general introduction of the
  hop (see <span class="sc">Ale</span>) as a preservative and astringent, a
  number of other bitter and aromatic plants had been employed with this
  end in view. Thus J.L. Baker (<i>The Brewing Industry</i>) points out
  that the Cimbri used the <i>Tamarix germanica</i>, the Scandinavians the
  fruit of the sweet gale (<i>Myrica gale</i>), the Cauchi the fruit and
  the twigs of the chaste tree (<i>Vitex agrius castus</i>), and the
  Icelanders the yarrow (<i><span class="correction" title="'Achilloea' in original"
  >Achillea</span> millefolium</i>).</p>

  <p>The preparation of beer on anything approaching to a manufacturing
  scale appears, until about the 12th or 13th century, to have been carried
  on in England chiefly in the monasteries; but as the brewers of London
  combined to form an association in the reign of Henry IV., and were
  granted a charter in 1445, it is evident that brewing as a special trade
  or industry must have developed with some rapidity. After the Reformation
  the ranks of the trade brewers were swelled by numbers of monks from the
  expropriated monasteries. Until the 18th century the professional
  brewers, or brewers for sale, as they are now called, brewed chiefly for
  the masses, the wealthier classes preparing their own beer, but it then
  became gradually apparent to the latter (owing no doubt to improved
  methods of brewing, and for others reasons) that it was more economical
  and less troublesome to have their beer brewed for them at a regular
  brewery. The usual charge was 30s. per barrel for bitter ale, and 8s. or
  so for small beer. This tendency to centralize brewing operations became
  more and more marked with each succeeding decade. Thus during 1895-1905
  the number of private brewers declined from 17,041 to 9930. Of the
  private brewers still existing, about four-fifths were in the class
  exempted from beer duty, <i>i.e.</i> farmers occupying houses not
  exceeding £10 annual value who brew for their labourers, and other
  persons occupying houses not exceeding £15 annual value. The private
  houses subject to both beer and licence duty produced less than 20,000
  barrels annually. There are no official figures as to the number of
  "cottage brewers," that is, occupiers of dwellings not exceeding £8
  annual value; but taking everything into consideration it is probable
  that more than 99% of the beer produced in the United Kingdom is brewed
  by public brewers (brewers for sale). The disappearance of the smaller
  public brewers or their absorption by the larger concerns has gone
  hand-in-hand with the gradual extinction of the private brewer. In the
  year 1894-1895 8863 licences were issued to brewers for sale, and by
  1904-1905 this number had been reduced to 5164. There are numerous
  reasons for these changes in the constitution of the brewing industry,
  chief among them being (<i>a</i>) the increasing difficulty, owing partly
  to <span class="correction" title="'lincensing' in original"
  >licensing</span> legislation and its administration, and partly to the
  competition of the great breweries, of obtaining an adequate outlet for
  retail sale in the shape of licensed houses; and (<i>b</i>) the fact that
  brewing has continuously become a more scientific and specialized
  industry, requiring costly and complicated plant and expert manipulation.
  It is only by employing the most up-to-date machinery and expert
  knowledge that the modern brewer can hope to produce good beer in the
  short time which competition and high taxation, &amp;c., have forced upon
  him. Under these conditions the small brewer tends to extinction, and the
  public are ultimately the gainers. The relatively non-alcoholic, lightly
  hopped and bright modern beers, which the small brewer has not the means
  of producing, are a great advance on the muddy, highly hopped and
  alcoholized beverages to which our ancestors were accustomed.</p>

  <p>The brewing trade has reached vast proportions in the United Kingdom.
  The maximum production was 37,090,986 barrels in 1900, and while there
  has been a steady decline since that year, the figures for
  1905-1906&mdash;34,109,263 barrels&mdash;were in excess of those for any
  year preceding 1897. It is interesting in this connexion to note that the
  writer of the article on Brewing in the 9th edition of the
  <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> was of the opinion that the brewing
  industry&mdash;which was then (1875) producing, roughly, 25,000,000
  barrels&mdash;had attained its maximum development. In the year ending
  30th September 1905 the beer duty received by the exchequer amounted to
  £13,156,053. The number of brewers for sale was 5180. Of these one firm,
  namely, Messrs Guinness, owning the largest brewery in the world, brewed
  upwards of two million barrels, paying a sum of, roughly, one million
  sterling to the revenue. Three other firms brewed close on a million
  barrels or upwards. The quantity of malt used was 51,818,697 bushels; of
  unmalted corn, 125,671 bushels; of rice, flaked maize and similar
  materials, 1,348,558 cwt.; of sugar, 2,746,615 cwt.; of hops, 62,360,817
  lb; and of hop substitutes, 49,202 lb. The average specific gravity of
  the beer produced in 1905-1906 was 1053.24. The quantity of beer exported
  was 520,826; of beer imported, 57,194 barrels. It is curious to note that
  the figures for exports and imports had remained almost stationary for
  the last thirty years. By far the greater part of the beer brewed is
  consumed in England. Thus of the total quantity retained for consumption
  in 1905-1906, 28,590,563 barrels were consumed in England, 1,648,463 in
  Scotland, and 3,265,084 in Ireland. In 1871 it was calculated by
  Professor Leone Levi that the capital invested in the liquor trade in the
  United Kingdom was £117,000,000. In 1908 this figure might be safely
  doubled. A writer in the <i>Brewers' Almanack</i> for 1906 placed the
  capital invested in limited liability breweries alone at £185,000,000. If
  we allow for over-capitalization, it seems fairly safe to say that, prior
  to the introduction of the Licensing Bill of 1908, the market value of
  the breweries in the United Kingdom, together with their licensed
  property, was in the neighbourhood of £120,000,000, to which might be
  added another £20,000,000 for the value of licences not included in the
  above calculation; the total capital actually sunk in the whole liquor
  trade (including the wine and spirit industries and trades) being
  probably not far short of £250,000,000, and the number of persons
  directly engaged in or dependent on the liquor trade being
  under-estimated at 2,000,000. (For comparative production and consumption
  see <span class="sc">Beer</span>.)</p>

  <p><i>Taxation and Regulations</i>.&mdash;The development of the brewing
  industry in England is intimately interwoven with the history of its
  taxation, and the regulations which have from time to time been formed
  for the safeguarding of the revenue. The first duty on beer in the United
  Kingdom was imposed in the reign of Charles II. (1660), namely 2s. 6d.
  per barrel on strong and 6d. per barrel on weak beer. This was gradually
  increased, amounting to 4s. 9d. on strong and 1s. 3d. on weak beer in the
  last decade of the 17th century, and to 8s. to 10s. in the year 1800, at
  which rate it continued until the repeal of the beer duty in 1830. A duty
  on malt was first imposed in the reign of William III. (1697), and from
  that date until 1830 both beer duty and malt tax were charged. The rate
  at first was under 7d. per bushel, but this was increased up to 2s. 7d.
  prior to the first repeal of the beer duty (1830), and to 4s. 6d. after
  the repeal. In 1829 the joint beer and malt taxes amounted to no less
  than 13s. 8d. per barrel, or 4½d. per gallon, as against 2½d. at the
  present day. From 1856 until the abolition of the malt tax, the latter
  remained constant at a fraction under 2s. 8½d. A <i>hop duty</i> varying
  from 1d. to 2½d. per pound was in existence between 1711 and 1862. One of
  the main reasons for the abolition of the hop duty was the fact that,
  owing to the uncertainty of the crop, the amount paid to the revenue was
  subject to wide fluctuations. Thus in 1855 the revenue from this source
  amounted to £728,183, in 1861 to only £149,700.</p>

  <p>It was not until 1847 that the use of sugar in brewing was permitted,
  and in 1850 the first sugar tax, amounting to 1s. 4d. per cwt., was
  imposed. It varied from this figure up to 6s. 6d. in 1854, and in 1874,
  when the general duty on sugar was repealed, it was raised to 11s. 6d.,
  at which rate it remained until 1880, when it was repealed simultaneously
  with the malt duty. In 1901 a general sugar tax of 4s. 2d. and under
  (according to the percentage of actual sugar contained) was imposed, but
  no drawback was allowed to brewers using sugar, and therefore&mdash;and
  this obtains at the present day&mdash;sugar used in brewing pays the
  general tax and also the beer duty.</p>

  <p>By the Free Mash-Tun Act of 1880, the duty was taken off the malt and
  placed on the beer, or, more properly speaking, on the wort; maltsters'
  and brewers' licences were repealed, and in lieu thereof an annual
  licence duty of £1 payable by every brewer for sale was <!-- Page 507
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page507"></a>[v.04
  p.0507]</span>imposed. The chief feature of this act was that, on and
  after the 1st of October 1880, a beer duty was imposed in lieu of the old
  malt tax, at the rate of 6s. 3d. per barrel of 36 gallons, at a specific
  gravity of 1.057, and the regulations for charging the duty were so
  framed as to leave the brewer practically unrestricted as to the
  description of malt or corn and sugar, or other description of saccharine
  substitutes (other than deleterious articles or drugs), which he might
  use in the manufacture or colouring of beer. This freedom in the choice
  of materials has continued down to the present time, except that the use
  of "saccharin" (a product derived from coal-tar) was prohibited in 1888,
  the reason being that this substance gives an apparent palate-fulness to
  beer equal to roughly 4° in excess of its real gravity, the revenue
  suffering thereby. In 1889 the duty on beer was increased by a reduction
  in the standard of gravity from 1.057 to 1.055, and in 1894 a further 6d.
  per barrel was added. The duty thus became 6s. 9d. per barrel, at a
  gravity of 1.055, which was further increased to 7s. 9d. per barrel by
  the war budget of 1900, at which figure it stood in 1909. (See also <span
  class="sc">Liquor Laws</span>.)</p>

  <p>Prior to 1896, rice, flaked maize (see below), and other similar
  preparations had been classed as malt or corn in reference to their
  wort-producing powers, but after that date they were deemed sugar<a
  name="FnAnchor_041" href="#Footnote_041"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in that
  regard. By the new act (1880) 42 lb weight of corn, or 28 lb weight of
  sugar, were to be deemed the equivalent of a bushel of malt, and a brewer
  was expected by one of the modes of charge to have brewed at least a
  barrel (36 gallons) of worts (less 4% allowed for wastage) at the
  standard gravity for every two bushels of malt (or its equivalents) used
  by him in brewing; but where, owing to lack of skill or inferior
  machinery, a brewer cannot obtain the standard quantity of wort from the
  standard equivalent of material, the charge is made not on the wort, but
  directly on the material. By the new act, licences at the annual duty of
  £1 on brewers for sale, and of 6s. (subsequently modified by 44 Vict. c.
  12, and 48 and 49 Vict. c. 5, &amp;c., to 4s.) or 9s., as the case might
  be, on any other brewers, were required. The regulations dealing with the
  mashing operations are very stringent. Twenty-four hours at least before
  mashing the brewer must enter in his brewing book (provided by the Inland
  Revenue) the day and hour for commencing to mash malt, corn, &amp;c., or
  to dissolve sugar; and the date of making such entry; and also, two hours
  at least before the notice hour for mashing, the quantity of malt, corn,
  &amp;c., and sugar to be used, and the day and hour when all the worts
  will be drawn off the grains in the mash-tun. The worts of each brewing
  <span class="correction" title="'much' in original">must</span> be
  collected within twelve hours of the commencement of the collection, and
  the brewer must within a given time enter in his book the quantity and
  gravity of the worts before fermentation, the number and name of the
  vessel, and the date of the entry. The worts must remain in the same
  vessel undisturbed for twelve hours after being collected, unless
  previously taken account of by the officer. There are other regulations,
  <i>e.g.</i> those prohibiting the mixing of worts of different brewings
  unless account has been taken of each separately, the alteration of the
  size or shape of any gauged vessel without notice, and so on.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Materials used in Brewing</span>.&mdash;These are
  water, malt (<i>q.v.</i>), hops (<i>q.v.</i>), various substitutes for
  the two latter, and preservatives.</p>

  <p><i>Water</i>.&mdash;A satisfactory supply of water&mdash;which, it may
  here be mentioned, is always called <i>liquor</i> in the brewery&mdash;is
  a matter of great importance to the brewer. Certain waters, for instance,
  those contaminated to any extent with organic matter, cannot be used at
  all in brewing, as they give rise to unsatisfactory fermentation,
  cloudiness and abnormal flavour. Others again, although suited to the
  production of one type of beer, are quite unfit for the brewing of
  another. For black beers a soft water is a desideratum, for ales of the
  Burton type a hard water is a necessity. For the brewing of mild ales,
  again, a water containing a certain proportion of chlorides is required.
  The presence or absence of certain mineral substances as such in the
  finished beer is not, apparently, a matter of any moment as regards
  flavour or appearance, but the importance of the rôle played by these
  substances in the brewing process is due to the influence which they
  exert on the solvent action of the water on the various constituents of
  the malt, and possibly of the hops. The excellent quality of the Burton
  ales was long ago surmised to be due mainly to the well water obtainable
  in that town. On analysing Burton water it was found to contain a
  considerable quantity of calcium sulphate&mdash;gypsum&mdash;and of other
  calcium and magnesium salts, and it is now a well-known fact that good
  bitter ales cannot be brewed except with waters containing these
  substances in sufficient quantities. Similarly, good mild ale waters
  should contain a certain quantity of sodium chloride, and waters for
  stout very little mineral matter, excepting perhaps the carbonates of the
  alkaline earths, which are precipitated on boiling.</p>

  <p>The following analyses (from W.J. Sykes, <i>The Principles and
  Practice of Brewing</i>) are fairly illustrative of typical brewing
  waters.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the essential chemical constituents of brewing waters
  enables brewers in many cases to treat an unsatisfactory supply
  artificially in such a manner as to modify its character in a favourable
  sense. Thus, if a soft water only is to hand, and it is desired to brew a
  bitter ale, all that is necessary is to add a sufficiency of gypsum,
  magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride. If it is desired to convert a
  soft water lacking in chlorides into a satisfactory mild ale liquor, the
  addition of 30-40 grains of sodium chloride will be necessary. On the
  other hand, to convert a hard water into a soft supply is scarcely
  feasible for brewing purposes. To the substances used for treating
  brewing liquors already mentioned we may add kainite, a naturally
  deposited composite salt containing potassium and magnesium sulphates and
  magnesium chloride.</p>

  <p><i>Malt Substitutes.</i>&mdash;Prior to the repeal of the Malt Acts,
  the only substitute for malt allowed in the United Kingdom was sugar. The
  quantity of the latter employed was 295,865 cwt. in 1870, 1,136,434 cwt.
  in 1880, and 2,746,615 cwt. in 1905; that is to say, that the quantity
  used had been practically trebled during the last twenty-five years,
  although the quantity of malt employed had not materially increased. At
  the same time other substitutes, such as unmalted corn and preparations
  of rice and maize, had come into favour, the quantity of these substances
  used being in 1905 125,671 bushels of unmalted corn and 1,348,558 cwt. of
  rice, maize, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The following statistics with regard to the use of malt substitutes in
  the United Kingdom are not without interest.</p>

  <p>The causes which have led to the largely increased use of substitutes
  in the United Kingdom are of a somewhat complex nature. In the first
  place, it was not until the malt tax was repealed that the brewer was
  able to avail himself of the surplus diastatic energy present in malt,
  for the purpose of transforming starch (other than that in malted grain)
  into sugar. The diastatic enzyme or ferment (see below, under
  <i>Mashing</i>) of malted barley is present in that material in great
  excess, and a part of this surplus energy may be usefully employed in
  converting the starch of unmalted grain into sugar. The brewer has found
  also that brewing operations are simplified and accelerated by the use of
  a certain proportion of substitutes, and that he is thereby enabled
  appreciably to increase his turn-over, <i>i.e.</i> he can make more beer
  in a given time from the same plant. Certain classes of substitutes, too,
  are somewhat cheaper than malt, and in view of the keenness of modern
  competition it is not to be wondered at that the brewer should resort to
  every legitimate means at his disposal to keep down costs. It has been
  contended, and apparently with much reason, that if the use of
  substitutes were prohibited this would not lead to an increased use of
  domestic barley, inasmuch as the supply of home barley suitable for
  malting purposes is of a limited nature. A return to the policy of "malt
  and hops only" would therefore lead to an increased use of foreign
  barley, and to a diminution in the demand for home barley, inasmuch as
  sugar and prepared cereals, containing as they do less nitrogen, &amp;c.
  than even the well-cured, sun-dried foreign barleys, are better diluents
  than the latter. At the same time, it is an undoubted fact that an
  excessive use of substitutes leads to the production of beer of poor
  quality. The better class of brewer rarely uses more than 15-20%, knowing
  that beyond that point the loss of flavour and quality will in the long
  run become a more serious item than any increased profits which he might
  temporarily gain.</p>

  <p>With regard to the nature of the substitutes or adjuncts for barley
  malt more generally employed, raw grain (unmalted barley, wheat, rice,
  maize, &amp;c.) is not used extensively in Great Britain, but in America
  brewers employ as much as 50%, and even more, of maize, rice or similar
  materials. The maize and rice preparations mostly used in England are
  practically starch pure and simple, substantially the whole of the oil,
  water, and other subsidiary constituents of the grain being removed. The
  germ of maize contains a considerable proportion of an oil of somewhat
  unpleasant flavour, which has to be eliminated before the material is fit
  for use in the mash-tun. After degerming, the maize is unhusked, wetted,
  submitted to a temperature sufficient to rupture the starch cells, dried,
  and finally rolled out in a flaky condition. Rice is similarly
  treated.</p>

  <p>The <i>sugars</i> used are chiefly cane sugar, glucose and invert
  sugar&mdash;the latter commonly known as "saccharum." Cane sugar is
  mostly used for the preparation of heavy mild ales and stouts, as it
  gives a peculiarly sweet and full flavour to the beer, to which, no
  doubt, the popularity of this class of beverage is largely due. <i>Invert
  sugar</i> is prepared by the action either of acid or of yeast on cane
  sugar. The chemical equation representing the conversion (or inversion)
  of cane sugar is:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Invert sugar is so called because the mixture of glucose and fructose
  which forms the "invert" is laevo-rotatory, whereas cane sugar is
  dextro-rotatory to the plane of polarized light. The preparation of
  invert sugar by the acid process consists in treating the cane sugar in
  solution with a little mineral acid, removing the excess of the latter by
  means of chalk, and concentrating to a thick syrup. The yeast process
  (Tompson's), which makes use of the inverting power of one of the enzymes
  (invertase) contained in ordinary yeast, is interesting. The cane sugar
  solution is pitched with yeast at about 55° C., and at this comparatively
  high temperature the inversion proceeds rapidly, and fermentation is
  practically impossible. When this operation is completed, the whole
  liquid (including the yeast) is run into the boiling contents of the
  copper. This method is more suited to the preparation of invert in the
  brewery itself than the acid process, which is almost exclusively used in
  special sugar works. Glucose, which is one of the constituents of invert
  sugar, is largely used by itself in brewing. It is, however, never
  prepared from invert sugar for this purpose, but directly from starch by
  means of acid. By the action of dilute boiling acid on starch the latter
  is rapidly converted first into a mixture of dextrine and maltose and
  then into glucose. The proportions of glucose, dextrine and maltose
  present in a commercial glucose depend very much on the duration of the
  boiling, the strength of the acid, and the extent of the pressure at
  which the starch is converted. In England the materials from which
  glucose is manufactured are generally sago, rice and purified maize. In
  Germany potatoes form the most common raw material, and in America
  purified Indian corn is ordinarily employed.</p>

  <p><i>Hop substitutes</i>, as a rule, are very little used. They mostly
  consist of quassia, gentian and camomile, and these substitutes are quite
  harmless <i>per se</i>, but impart an unpleasantly rough and bitter taste
  to the beer.</p>

  <p><i>Preservatives</i>.&mdash;These are generally, in fact almost
  universally, employed nowadays for draught ales; to a smaller extent for
  stock ales. The light beers in vogue to-day are less alcoholic, more
  lightly hopped, and more quickly brewed than the beers of the last
  generation, and in this respect are somewhat less stable and more likely
  to deteriorate than the latter were. The preservative in part replaces
  the alcohol and the hop extract, and shortens the brewing time. The
  preservatives mostly used are the bisulphites of lime and potash, and
  these, when employed in small quantities, are generally held to be
  harmless.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Brewing Operations</span>.&mdash;The general scheme
  of operations in an English brewery will be readily understood if
  reference be made to fig. 1, which represents an 8-quarter brewery on the
  <i>gravitation system</i>, the principle of which is that all materials
  to be employed are pumped or hoisted to the highest point required, to
  start with, and that subsequently no further pumping or hoisting is
  required, the materials (in the shape of water, malt, wort or hops,
  &amp;c.) being conveyed from one point to another by the force of
  gravity.</p>

  <p>The malt, which is hoisted to the top floor, after cleaning and
  grading is conveyed to the <i>Malt Mill</i>, where it is crushed. Thence
  the ground malt, or "grist" as it is now called, passes to the <i>Grist
  Hopper</i>, and from the latter to the <i>Mashing Machine</i>, in which
  it is intimately mixed with hot water from the <i>Hot Liquor Vessel</i>.
  From the mashing machine the mixed grist and "liquor" pass to the
  <i>Mash-Tun</i>, where the starch of the malt is rendered soluble. From
  the mash-tun the clear wort passes to the <i>Copper</i>, where it is
  boiled with hops. From the copper the boiled wort passes to the <i>Hop
  Back</i>, where the insoluble hop constituents are separated from the
  wort. From the hop back the wort passes to the <i>Cooler</i>, from the
  latter to the <i>Refrigerator</i>, thence (for the purpose of enabling
  the revenue officers to assess the duty) to the <i>Collecting
  Vessel</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_044" href="#Footnote_044"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
  and finally to the <i>Fermenting Vessels</i>, in which the wort is
  transformed into "green" beer. The latter is then cleansed, and finally
  racked and stored.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the above that brewing consists of seven distinct
  main processes, which may be classed as follows: (1) Grinding; (2)
  Mashing; (3) Boiling; (4) Cooling; (5) Fermenting; (6) Cleansing; (7)
  Racking and Storing.</p>

  <p><i>Grinding</i>.&mdash;In most modern breweries the malt passes, on
  its way <!-- Page 509 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page509"></a>[v.04 p.0509]</span>from the bins to the mill, through
  a cleaning and grading apparatus, and then through an automatic measuring
  machine. The mills, which exist in a variety of designs, are of the
  smooth roller type, and are so arranged that the malt is <i>crushed</i>
  rather than ground. If the malt is ground too fine, difficulties arise in
  regard to efficient drainage in the mash-tun and subsequent
  clarification. On the other hand, if the crushing is too coarse the
  subsequent extraction of soluble matter in the mash-tun is incomplete,
  and an inadequate yield results.</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>Mashing</i> is a process which consists mainly in extracting, by
  means of water at an adequate temperature, the soluble matters
  pre-existent in the malt, and in converting the insoluble starch and a
  great part of the insoluble nitrogenous compounds into soluble and partly
  fermentable products. Mashing is, without a doubt, the most important of
  the brewing processes, for it is largely in the mash-tun that the
  character of the beer to be brewed is determined. In modern practice the
  malt and the mashing "liquor" (<i>i.e.</i> water) are introduced into the
  mash-tun simultaneously, by means of the mashing machine (fig. 2, A).
  This is generally a cylindrical metal vessel, commanding the mash-tun and
  provided with a central shaft and screw. The grist (as the crushed malt
  is called) enters the mashing machine from the grist case above, and the
  liquor is introduced at the back. The screw is rotated rapidly, and so a
  thorough mixture of the grist and liquor takes place as they travel along
  the mashing machine. The mash-tun (fig. 2) is a large metal or wooden
  vessel, fitted with a false bottom composed of plates perforated with
  numerous small holes or slits (C). This arrangement is necessary in order
  to obtain a proper separation of the "wort" (as the liquid portion of the
  finished mash is called) from the spent grains. The mash-tun is also
  provided with a stirring apparatus (the <i>rakes</i>) so that the grist
  and liquor may be intimately mixed (D), and an automatic sprinkler, the
  <i>sparger</i> (fig. 2, B, and fig. 3), which is employed in order to
  wash out the wort remaining in the grains. The sparger consists of a
  number of hollow arms radiating from a common centre and pierced by a
  number of small perforations. The common central vessel from which the
  sparge-arms radiate is mounted in such a manner that it rotates
  automatically when a stream of water is admitted, so that a constant fine
  spray covers the whole tun when the sparger is in operation. There are
  also pipes for admitting "liquor" to the bottom of the tun, and for
  carrying the wort from the latter to the "underback" or "copper."</p>

  <p>The grist and liquor having been introduced into the tun (either by
  means of the mashing machine or separately), the rakes are set going, so
  that the mash may become thoroughly homogeneous, and after a short time
  the rakes are stopped and the mash allowed to rest, usually for a period
  of about two hours. After this, "taps are set"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
  communication is established between the mash-tun and the vessel into
  which the wort runs&mdash;and the sparger is started. In this manner the
  whole of the wort or extract is separated from the grains. The quantity
  of water employed is, in all, from two to three barrels to the quarter
  (336 lb) of malt.</p>

  <p>In considering the process of mashing, one might almost say the
  process of brewing, it is essential to remember that the type and quality
  of the beer to be produced (see <span class="sc">Malt</span>) depends
  almost entirely (<i>a</i>) on the kind of malt employed, and (<i>b</i>)
  on the mashing temperature. In other words, quality may be controlled on
  the kiln or in the mash-tun, or both. Viewed in this light, the following
  theoretical methods for preparing different types of beer are
  possible:&mdash;(1) high kiln heats and high mashing temperatures; (2)
  high kiln heats and low mashing temperatures; (3) low kiln heats and high
  mashing temperatures; and (4) low kiln heats and low mashing
  temperatures. In practice all these combinations, together with many
  intermediate ones, are met with, and it is not too much to say that the
  whole science of modern brewing is based upon them. It is plain, then,
  that the mashing temperature will depend on the kind of beer that is to
  be produced, and on the kind of malt employed. For stouts and black beers
  generally, a mashing temperature of 148° to 150° F. is most usual; for
  pale or stock ales, 150° to 154° F.; and for mild running beers, 154° to
  149° F. The range of temperatures employed in brewing English beers is a
  very limited one as compared with foreign mashing methods, and does not
  range further, practically speaking, than from 140° to 160° F. The effect
  of higher temperatures is chiefly to cripple the enzyme or "ferment"
  diastase, which, as already said, is the agent which converts the
  insoluble starch into soluble dextrin, sugar and intermediate products.
  The higher the mashing temperature, the more the diastase will be
  crippled in its action, and the more dextrinous (non-fermentable) matter
  as compared with maltose (fermentable sugar) will be formed. A pale or
  stock ale, which is a type of beer that must be "dry" and that will keep,
  requires to contain a relatively high proportion of dextrin and little
  maltose, and, in its preparation, therefore, a high mashing temperature
  will be employed. On the other hand, a mild running ale, which is a full,
  sweet beer, intended for rapid consumption, will be obtained by means of
  low mashing temperatures, which produce relatively little dextrin, but a
  good deal of maltose, <i>i.e.</i> sweet and readily fermentable
  matter.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/brewing_3.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/brewing_3.png"
      alt="Sparger." title="Sparger." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Sparger.
  </div>
  <p>Diastase is not the only enzyme present in malt. There is also a
  ferment which renders a part of the nitrogenous matter soluble. This
  again is affected by temperature in much the same way as diastase. Low
  heats tend to produce much non-coagulable <!-- Page 510 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page510"></a>[v.04 p.0510]</span>nitrogenous
  matter, which is undesirable in a stock beer, as it tends to produce fret
  and side fermentations. With regard to the kind of malt and other
  materials employed in producing various types of beer, pale ales are made
  either from pale malt (generally a mixture of English and fine foreign,
  such as Smyrna, California) only, or from pale malt and a little flaked
  maize, rice, invert sugar or glucose. Running beers (mild ale) are made
  from a mixture of pale and amber malts, sugar and flaked goods; stout,
  from a mixture of pale, amber and roasted (black) malts only, or with the
  addition of a little sugar or flaked maize.</p>

  <p>When raw grain is employed, the process of mashing is slightly
  modified. The maize, rice or other grain is usually gelatinized in a
  vessel (called a <i>converter</i> or <i>cooker</i>) entirely separated
  from the mash-tun, by means of steam at a relatively high temperature,
  mostly with, but occasionally without, the addition of some malt meal.
  After about half an hour the gelatinized mass is mixed with the main
  mash, and this takes place shortly before taps are set. This is possible
  inasmuch as the starch, being already in a highly disintegrated
  condition, is very rapidly converted. By working on the limited-decoction
  system (see below), it is possible to make use of a fair percentage of
  raw grain in the mash-tun proper, thus doing away with the "converter"
  entirely.</p>

  <p><i>The Filter Press Process.</i>&mdash;The ordinary mash-tun process,
  as described above, possesses the disadvantage that only coarse grists
  can be employed. This entails loss of extract in several ways. To begin
  with, the sparging process is at best a somewhat inefficient method for
  washing out the last portions of the wort, and again, when the malt is at
  all hard or "steely," starch conversion is by no means complete. These
  disadvantages are overcome by the filter press process, which was first
  introduced into Great Britain by the Belgian engineer P. Meura. The malt,
  in this method of brewing, is ground quite fine, and although an ordinary
  mash-tun may be used for mashing, the separation of the clear wort from
  the solid matter takes place in the filter press, which retains the very
  finest particles with ease. It is also a simple matter to wash out the
  wort from the filter cake in the presses, and experience has shown that
  markedly increased yields are thus obtained. In the writer's opinion,
  there is little doubt that in the future this, or a similar process, will
  find a very wide application.</p>

  <p><i>Boiling</i>.&mdash;From the mash-tun the wort passes to the
  <i>copper</i>. If it is not possible to arrange the plant so that the
  coppers are situated beneath the mash-tuns (as is the case in breweries
  arranged on the <i>gravitation system</i>), an intermediate collecting
  vessel (the underback) is interposed, and from this the wort is pumped
  into the copper. The latter is a large copper vessel heated by direct
  fire or steam. Modern coppers are generally closed in with a dome-shaped
  head, but many old-fashioned open coppers are still to be met with, in
  fact pale-ale brewers prefer open coppers. In the closed type the wort is
  frequently boiled under slight pressure. When the wort has been raised to
  the boil, the hops or a part thereof are added, and the boiling is
  continued generally from an hour to three hours, according to the type of
  beer. The objects of boiling, briefly put, are: (1) sterilization of the
  wort; (2) extraction from the hops of substances that give flavour and
  aroma to the beer; (3) the coagulation and precipitation of a part of the
  nitrogenous matter (the coagulable albuminoids), which, if left in, would
  cause cloudiness and fret, &amp;c., in the finished beer; (4) the
  concentration of the wort. At least three distinct substances are
  extracted from the hops in boiling. First, the <i>hop tannin</i>, which,
  combining with a part of the proteids derived from the malt, precipitates
  them; second, the <i>hop resin</i>, which acts as a preservative and
  bitter; third, the <i>hop oil</i>, to which much of the fine aroma of
  beer is due. The latter is volatile, and it is customary, therefore, not
  to add the whole of the hops to the wort when it commences to boil, but
  to reserve about a third until near the end of the copper stage. The
  quantity of hops employed varies according to the type of beer, from
  about 3 lb to 15 lb per quarter (336 lb) of malt. For mild ales and
  porters about 3 to 4 lb, for light pale ales and light stouts 6 to 10 lb,
  and for strong ales and stouts 9 to 15 lb of hops are employed.</p>

  <p><i>Cooling</i>.&mdash;When the wort has boiled the necessary time, it
  is turned into the <i>hop back</i> to settle. A hop back is a wooden or
  metal vessel, fitted with a false bottom of perforated plates; the latter
  retain the spent hops, the wort being drawn off into the coolers. After
  resting for a brief period in the hop back, the bright wort is run into
  the <i>coolers</i>. The cooler is a very shallow vessel of great area,
  and the result of the exposure of the hot wort to a comparatively large
  volume of air is that a part of the hop constituents and other substances
  contained in the wort are rendered insoluble and are precipitated. It was
  formerly considered absolutely essential that this hot aeration should
  take place, but in many breweries nowadays coolers are not used, the wort
  being run direct from the hop back to the refrigerator. There is much to
  be said for this procedure, as the exposure of hot wort in the cooler is
  attended with much danger of bacterial and wild yeast infection, but it
  is still a moot point whether the cooler or its equivalent can be
  entirely dispensed with for all classes of beers. A rational alteration
  would appear to be to place the cooler in an air-tight chamber supplied
  with purified and sterilized air. This principle has already been applied
  to the refrigerator, and apparently with success. In America the cooler
  is frequently replaced by a cooling tank, an enclosed vessel of some
  depth, capable of artificial aeration. It is not practicable, in any
  case, to cool the wort sufficiently on the cooler to bring it to the
  proper temperature for the fermentation stage, and for this purpose,
  therefore, the <i>refrigerator</i> is employed. There are several kinds
  of refrigerators, the main distinction being that some are vertical,
  others horizontal; but the principle in each case is much the same, and
  consists in allowing a thin film or stream of wort to trickle over a
  series of pipes through which cold water circulates. Fig. 5, Plate I.,
  shows refrigerators, employed in Messrs Allsopp's lager beer brewery, at
  work.</p>

  <p><i>Fermenting</i>.&mdash;By the process of fermentation the wort is
  converted into beer. By the action of living yeast cells (see <span
  class="sc">Fermentation</span>) the sugar contained in the wort is split
  up into alcohol and carbonic acid, and a number of subsidiary reactions
  occur. There are two main systems of fermentation, the <i>top
  fermentation</i> system, which is that employed in the United Kingdom,
  and the <i>bottom fermentation</i> system, which is that used for the
  production of beers of the continental ("lager") type. The wort,
  generally at a temperature of about 60° F. (this applies to all the
  systems excepting B [see below], in which the temperature is higher), is
  "pitched" with liquid yeast (or "barm," as it is often called) at the
  rate of, according to the type and strength of the beer to be made, 1 to
  4 lb to the barrel. After a few hours a slight froth or scum makes its
  appearance on the surface of the liquid. At the end of a further short
  period this develops into a light curly mass (<i>cauliflower</i> or
  <i>curly head</i>), which gradually becomes lighter and more solid in
  appearance, and is then known as <i>rocky head</i>. This in its turn
  shrinks to a compact mass&mdash;the <i>yeasty head</i>&mdash;which emits
  great bubbles of gas with a hissing sound. At this point the
  <i>cleansing</i> of the beer&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the separation of the
  yeast from the liquid&mdash;has fairly commenced, and it is let down
  (except in the skimming and Yorkshire systems [see below]) into the
  pontos or unions, as the case may be. During fermentation the temperature
  rises considerably, and in order to prevent an excessive temperature
  being obtained (70-75° F. should be the maximum) the fermenting vessels
  are fitted with "attemperators," <i>i.e.</i> a system of pipes through
  which cold water may be run.</p>

  <p><i>Cleansing</i>.&mdash;In England the methods of applying the top
  fermentation system may be classified as follows: (A) <i>The Cleansing
  System</i>: (<i>a</i>) Skimming System, (<i>b</i>) Dropping System
  (pontos or ordinary dropping system), (<i>c</i>) Burton Union System. (B)
  <i>The Yorkshire Stone Square System</i>.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:40%;">

      alt="Sparger." title="Sparger." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Fermenting Round.<br /> A,
    Skimmer; B, Parachute; C, Attemperator.
  </div>
  <p>(A) In (<i>a</i>) the <i>Skimming System</i> the fermentation from
  start to finish takes place in wooden vessels (termed "squares" or
  "rounds"), fitted with an attemperator and a parachute or other similar
  skimming device for removing or "skimming" the yeast at the end of the
  fermentation (fig. 4). The principle of (<i>b</i>) the <i>Dropping
  System</i> is that the beer undergoes only the main fermentation in the
  "round" or "square," and is then dropped down into a second vessel or
  vessels, in which fermentation and cleansing are completed. The
  <i>ponto</i> system of dropping, which is now somewhat old-fashioned,
  consists in discharging the beer into a series of vat-like vessels,
  fitted with a peculiarly-shaped overflow lip. The yeast works its way out
  of the vessel over the lip, and then flows into a gutter and is
  collected. The pontos are kept filled with beer by means of a vessel
  placed at a higher level. In the <i>ordinary</i> dropping system the
  partly fermented beer is let down from the "squares" and "rounds" into
  large vessels, termed dropping or skimming "backs." These are fitted with
  attemperators, and parachutes for the removal of yeast, in much the same
  way as in the skimming system. As a rule the parachute covers the whole
  width of the back. (<i>c</i>) The <i>Burton Union System</i> is really an
  improved ponto system. A series of casks, supplied with beer at the
  cleansing stage from a feed vessel, are mounted so that they may rotate
  axially. Each cask is fitted with an attemperator, a pipe and cock at the
  base for the removal of the finished beer and "bottoms," and lastly with
  a swan neck fitting through a bung-hole and commanding a common gutter.
  This system yields excellent results for certain classes of beers, and
  many Burton brewers think it is essential for obtaining <!-- Page 511
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page511"></a>[v.04 p.0511]</span>the
  Burton character. Fig. 6 (Plate II.) shows the process in operation in
  Messrs Allsopp's brewery.</p>

  <p>(B) <i>The Stone Square System</i>, which is only used to a certain
  extent (exclusively in the north of England), practically consists in
  pumping the fermenting wort from one to the other of two superimposed
  square vessels, connected with one another by means of a man-hole and a
  valve. These squares are built of stone and kept very cool. At the end of
  the fermentation the yeast (after closing the man-hole) is removed from
  the top square.</p>

  <p><i>Racking, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;After the fermentation and cleansing
  operations are completed, the beer is racked off (sometimes after passing
  a few hours in a settling tank) into storage vessels or trade casks. The
  finest "stock" and "pale" ales are stored from six weeks to three months
  prior to going out, but "running" beers (mild ales, &amp;c.) are
  frequently sent out of the brewery within a week or ten days of mashing.
  It is usual to add some hops in cask (this is called <i>dry hopping</i>)
  in the case of many of the better beers. Running beers, which must be put
  into condition rapidly, or beers that have become flat, are generally
  <i>primed</i>. Priming consists in adding a small quantity of sugar
  solution to the beer in cask. This rapidly ferments and so produces
  "condition."</p>

  <p><i>Fining</i>.&mdash;As a very light article is desired nowadays, and
  this has to be provided in a short time, artificial means must be
  resorted to, in order to replace the natural fining or brightening which
  storage brings about. <i>Finings</i> generally consist of a solution or
  semi-solution of isinglass in sour beer, or in a solution of tartaric
  acid or of sulphurous acid. After the finings are added to the beer and
  the barrels have been well rolled, the finings slowly precipitate (or
  work out through the bung-hole) and carry with them the matter which
  would otherwise render the beer turbid.</p>

  <p><i>Bottling</i>.&mdash;Formerly it was the general custom to brew a
  special beer for bottling, and this practice is still continued by some
  brewers. It is generally admitted that the special brew, matured by
  storage and an adequate secondary fermentation, produces the best beer
  for bottling, but the modern taste for a very light and bright bottled
  beer at a low cost has necessitated the introduction of new methods. The
  most interesting among these is the "chilling" and "carbonating" system.
  In this the beer, when it is ripe for racking, is first "chilled," that
  is, cooled to a very low temperature. As a result, there is an immediate
  deposition of much matter which otherwise would require prolonged time to
  settle. The beer is then filtered and so rendered quite bright, and
  finally, in order to produce immediate "condition," is "carbonated,"
  <i>i.e.</i> impregnated under pressure with carbon dioxide (carbonic acid
  gas).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Foreign Brewing and Beers.</span>&mdash;The system of
  brewing which differs most widely from the English <i>infusion</i> and
  <i>top fermentation</i> method is the <i>decoction</i> and <i>bottom
  fermentation</i> system, so widely employed, chiefly on the continent of
  Europe, for the production of beers of the "lager" type.</p>

  <p>The method pursued in the decoction system is broadly as
  follows:&mdash;After the grist has been mashed with cold water until a
  homogeneous mixture ensues, sufficient hot water is introduced into the
  mash-tun to raise the temperature to 85-100° F., according to
  circumstances. Thereupon, about one-third of the mash (including the
  "goods") is transferred to the <i>Maisch Kessel</i> (mash copper), in
  which it is gradually brought to a temperature of (about) 165° F., and
  this heat is maintained until the mash becomes transparent. The
  <i>Dickmaische</i>, as this portion is called, is then raised to the
  boil, and the ebullition sustained between a quarter and three-quarters
  of an hour. Just sufficient of the <i>Dickmaische</i> is returned to the
  mash-tun proper to raise the temperature of the whole to 111-125° F., and
  after a few minutes a third is again withdrawn and treated as before, to
  form the second "thick mash." When the latter has been returned to the
  mash-tun the whole is thoroughly worked up, allowed to stand in order
  that the solids may deposit, and then another third (called the
  <i>Läutermaische</i> or "clear mash") is withdrawn, boiled until the
  coagulable albuminoids are precipitated, and finally reconveyed to the
  mash-tun, where the mashing is continued for some time, the final heat
  being rather over 160° F. The wort, after boiling with hops and cooling,
  much as in the English system, is subjected to the peculiar system of
  fermentation called <i>bottom fermentation</i>. In this system the
  "pitching" and fermentation take place at a very low temperature and,
  compared with the English system, in very small vessels. The fermenting
  cellars are maintained at a temperature of about 37-38° F., and the
  temperature of the fermenting wort does not rise above 50° F. The yeast,
  which is of a different type from that employed in the English system,
  remains at the bottom of the fermenting tun, and hence is derived the
  name of "bottom fermentation" (see <span class="sc">Fermentation</span>).
  The primary fermentation lasts about eleven to twelve days (as compared
  with three days on the English system), and the beer is then run into
  store (lager) casks where it remains at a temperature approaching the
  freezing-point of water for six weeks to six months, according to the
  time of the year and the class of the beer. As to the relative character
  and stability of decoction and infusion beers, the latter are, as a rule,
  more alcoholic; but the former contain more unfermented malt extract, and
  are therefore, broadly speaking, more nutritive. Beers of the German type
  are less heavily hopped and more peptonized than English beers, and more
  highly charged with carbonic acid, which, owing to the low fermentation
  and storing temperatures, is retained for a comparatively long time and
  keeps the beer in condition. On the other hand, infusion beers are of a
  more stable and stimulating character. It is impossible to keep "lager"
  beer on draught in the ordinary sense of the term in England. It will not
  keep unless placed on ice, and, as a matter of fact, the "condition" of
  lager is dependent to a far greater extent on the methods of distribution
  and storage than is the case with infusion beers. If a cask is opened it
  must be rapidly consumed; indeed it becomes undrinkable within a very few
  hours. The gas escapes rapidly when the pressure is released, the
  temperature rises, and the beer becomes flat and mawkish. In Germany
  every publican is bound to have an efficient supply of ice, the latter
  frequently being delivered by the brewery together with the beer.</p>

  <p>In America the common system of brewing is one of infusion mashing
  combined with bottom fermentation. The method of mashing, however, though
  on infusion lines, differs appreciably from the English process. A very
  low initial heat&mdash;about 100° F.&mdash;at which the mash remains for
  about an hour, is employed. After this the temperature is rapidly raised
  to 153-156° F. by running in the boiling "cooker mash," <i>i.e.</i> raw
  grain wort from the converter. After a period the temperature is
  gradually increased to about 165° F. The very low initial heat, and the
  employment of relatively large quantities of readily transformable malt
  adjuncts, enable the American brewer to make use of a class of malt which
  would be considered quite unfit for brewing in an English brewery. The
  system of fermentation is very similar to the continental "lager" system,
  and the beer obtained bears some resemblance to the German product. To
  the English palate it is somewhat flavourless, but it is always retailed
  in exceedingly brilliant condition and at a proper temperature. There can
  be little doubt that every nation evolves a type of beer most suited to
  its climate and the temperament of the people, and in this respect the
  modern American beer is no exception. In regard to plant and mechanical
  arrangements generally, the modern American breweries may serve as an
  object-lesson to the European brewer, although there are certainly a
  number of breweries in the United Kingdom which need not fear comparison
  with the best American plants.</p>

  <p>It is a sign of the times and further evidence as to the growing taste
  for a lighter type of beer, that lager brewing in its most modern form
  has now fairly taken root in Great Britain, and in this connexion the
  process introduced by Messrs Allsopp exhibits many features of interest.
  The following is a brief description of the plant and the methods
  employed:&mdash;The wort is prepared on infusion lines, and is then
  cooled by means of refrigerated brine before passing to a temporary store
  tank, which serves as a gauging vessel. From the latter the wort passes
  directly to the fermenting tuns, huge closed cylindrical vessels made of
  sheet-steel and coated with glass enamel. There the wort ferments under
  reduced pressure, the carbonic acid generated being removed by means of a
  vacuum pump, and the gas thus withdrawn is replaced by the introduction
  of cool sterilized air. The fermenting cellars are kept at 40° F. The
  yeast employed is a pure culture (see <span
  class="sc">Fermentation</span>) bottom yeast, but the withdrawal of the
  products of yeast metabolism and the constant supply of pure fresh air
  cause the fermentation to proceed far more rapidly than is the case with
  lager beer brewed on ordinary lines. It is, in fact, finished in about
  six days. Thereupon the air-supply is cut off, the green beer again
  cooled to 40° F. and <!-- Page 512 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page512"></a>[v.04 p.0512]</span>then conveyed by means of filtered
  air pressure to the store tanks, where secondary fermentation, lasting
  three weeks, takes place. The gases evolved are allowed to collect under
  pressure, so that the beer is thoroughly charged with the carbonic acid
  necessary to give it condition. Finally the beer is again cooled,
  filtered, racked and bottled, the whole of these operations taking place
  under counter pressure, so that no gas can escape; indeed, from the time
  the wort leaves the copper to the moment when it is bottled in the shape
  of beer, it does not come into contact with the outer air.</p>

  <p>The preparation of the Japanese beer <i>saké</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) is of
  interest. The first stage consists in the preparation of <i>Koji</i>,
  which is obtained by treating steamed rice with a culture of
  <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. This micro-organism converts the starch into
  sugar. The <i>Koji</i> is converted into <i>moto</i> by adding it to a
  thin paste of fresh-boiled starch in a vat. Fermentation is set up and
  lasts for 30 to 40 days. The third stage consists in adding more rice and
  <i>Koji</i> to the <i>moto</i>, together with some water. A secondary
  fermentation, lasting from 8 to 10 days, ensues. Subsequently the whole
  is filtered, heated and run into casks, and is then known as <i>saké</i>.
  The interest of this process consists in the fact that a single
  micro-organism&mdash;a mould&mdash;is able to exercise the combined
  functions of saccharification and fermentation. It replaces the diastase
  of malted grain and also the yeast of a European brewery. Another liquid
  of interest is <i>Weissbier</i>. This, which is largely produced in
  Berlin (and in some respects resembles the <i>wheat-beer</i> produced in
  parts of England), is generally prepared from a mash of three parts of
  wheat malt and one part of barley malt. The fermentation is of a
  symbiotic nature, two organisms, namely a yeast and a fission fungus (the
  <i>lactic acid bacillus</i>) taking part in it. The preparation of this
  peculiar double ferment is assisted by the addition of a certain quantity
  of white wine to the yeast prior to fermentation.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Brewing Chemistry</span>.&mdash;The principles of
  brewing technology belong for the most part to physiological chemistry,
  whilst those of the cognate industry, malting, are governed exclusively
  by that branch of knowledge. Alike in following the growth of barley in
  field, its harvesting, maturing and conversion into malt, as well as the
  operations of mashing malt, fermenting wort, and conditioning beer,
  physiological chemistry is needed. On the other hand, the consideration
  of the saline matter in waters, the composition of the extract of worts
  and beers, and the analysis of brewing materials and products generally,
  belong to the domain of pure chemistry. Since the extractive matters
  contained in wort and beer consist for the most part of the
  transformation products of starch, it is only natural that these should
  have received special attention at the hands of scientific men associated
  with the brewing industry. It was formerly believed that by the action of
  diastase on starch the latter is first converted into a gummy substance
  termed dextrin, which is then subsequently transformed into a
  sugar&mdash;glucose. F.A. Musculus, however, in 1860, showed that sugar
  and dextrin are simultaneously produced, and between the years 1872 and
  1876 Cornelius O'Sullivan definitely proved that the sugar produced was
  maltose. When starch-paste, the jelly formed by treating starch with
  boiling water, is mixed with iodine solution, a deep blue coloration
  results. The first product of starch degradation by either acids or
  diastase, namely soluble starch, also exhibits the same coloration when
  treated with iodine. As degradation proceeds, and the products become
  more and more soluble and diffusible, the blue reaction with iodine gives
  place first to a purple, then to a reddish colour, and finally the
  coloration ceases altogether. In the same way, the optical rotating power
  decreases, and the cupric reducing power (towards Fehling's solution)
  increases, as the process of hydrolysis proceeds. C. O'Sullivan was the
  first to point out definitely the influence of the temperature of the
  mash on the character of the products. The work of Horace T. Brown (with
  J. Heron) extended that of O'Sullivan, and (with G.H. Morris) established
  the presence of an intermediate product between the higher dextrins and
  maltose. This product was termed maltodextrin, and Brown and Morris were
  led to believe that a large number of these substances existed in malt
  wort. They proposed for these substances the generic name "amyloins."
  Although according to their view they were compounds of maltose and
  dextrin, they had the properties of mixtures of these two substances. On
  the assumption of the existence of these compounds, Brown and his
  colleagues formulated what is known as the maltodextrin or amyloin
  hypothesis of starch degradation. C.J. Lintner, in 1891, claimed to have
  separated a sugar, isomeric with maltose, which is termed isomaltose,
  from the products of starch hydrolysis. A.R. Ling and J.L. Baker, as well
  as Brown and Morris, in 1895, proved that this isomaltose was not a
  homogeneous substance, and evidence tending to the same conclusion was
  subsequently brought forward by continental workers. Ling and Baker, in
  1897, isolated the following compounds from the products of starch
  hydrolysis&mdash;maltodextrin-<span class="grk">&alpha;</span>,
  C<sub>36</sub>H<sub>62</sub>O<sub>31</sub>, and maltodextrin-<span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>42</sub>O<sub>21</sub>
  (previously named by Prior, achroodextrin III.). They also separated a
  substance, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, isomeric with
  maltose, which had, however, the characteristics of a dextrin. This is
  probably identical with the so-called dextrinose isolated by V. Syniewski
  in 1902, which yields a phenylosazone melting at 82-83° C. It has been
  proved by H. Ost that the so-called isomaltose of Lintner is a mixture of
  maltose and another substance, maltodextrin, isomeric with Ling and
  Baker's maltodextrin-<span class="grk">&beta;</span>.</p>

  <p>The theory of Brown and Morris of the degradation of starch, although
  based on experimental evidence of some weight, is by no means universally
  accepted. Nevertheless it is of considerable interest, as it offers a
  rational and consistent explanation of the phenomena known to accompany
  the transformation of starch by diastase, and even if not strictly
  correct it has, at any rate, proved itself to be a practical working
  hypothesis, by which the mashing and fermenting operations may be
  regulated and controlled. According to Brown and Morris, the starch
  molecule consists of five amylin groups, each of which corresponds to the
  molecular formula
  (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>10</sub>)<sub>20</sub>. Four of these
  amylin radicles are grouped centrally round the fifth, thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>By the action of diastase, this complex molecule is split up,
  undergoing hydrolysis into four groups of amyloins, the fifth or central
  group remaining unchanged (and under brewing conditions unchangeable),
  forming the substance known as stable dextrin. When diastase acts on
  starch-paste, hydrolysis proceeds as far as the reaction represented by
  the following equation:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The amyloins are substances containing varying numbers of amylin
  (original starch or dextrin) groups in conjunction with a proportional
  number of maltose groups. They are not separable into maltose and dextrin
  by any of the ordinary means, but exhibit the properties of mixtures of
  these substances. As the process of hydrolysis proceeds, the amyloins
  become gradually poorer in amylin and relatively richer in
  maltose-groups. The final products of transformation, according to Brown
  and J.H. Millar, are maltose and glucose, which latter is derived from
  the hydrolysis of the stable dextrin. This theory may be applied in
  practical brewing in the following manner. If it is desired to obtain a
  beer of a stable character&mdash;that is to say, one containing a
  considerable proportion of high-type amyloins&mdash;it is necessary to
  restrict the action of the diastase in the mash-tun accordingly. On the
  other hand, for mild running ales, which are to "condition" rapidly, it
  is necessary to provide for the presence of sufficient maltodextrin of a
  low type. Investigation has shown that the type of maltodextrin can be
  regulated, not only in the mash-tun but also on the malt-kiln. A higher
  type is obtained by low kiln and high mashing temperatures than by high
  kiln and low mashing heats, and it is possible therefore to regulate, on
  scientific lines, not only the quality but also the type of amyloins
  which are suitable for a particular beer.</p>

  <p>The chemistry of the nitrogenous constituents of malt is equally
  important with that of starch and its transformations. Without
  nitrogenous compounds of the proper type, vigorous fermentations are not
  possible. It may be remembered that yeast assimilates nitrogenous
  compounds in some of their simpler forms&mdash;amides and the like. One
  of the aims of the maltster is, therefore, to break down the protein
  substances present in barley to such a degree that the wort has a maximum
  nutritive value for the yeast. Further, it is necessary for the
  production of stable beer to eliminate a large proportion of nitrogenous
  matter, and this is only done by the yeast when the proteins are
  degraded. There is also some evidence that the presence of albumoses
  assists in producing the foaming properties of beer. It has now been
  established definitely, by the work of A. Fernbach, W. Windisch, F.Weiss
  and P. Schidrowitz, that finished malt contains at least two proteolytic
  enzymes (a peptic and a pancreatic enzyme).</p>

  <p><b>BREWSTER, SIR DAVID</b> (1781-1868), Scottish natural philosopher,
  was born on the 11th of December 1781 at Jedburgh, where his father, a
  teacher of high reputation, was rector of the grammar school. At the
  early age of twelve he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, being
  intended for the clerical profession. Even before this, however, he had
  shown a strong inclination for natural science, and this had been
  fostered by his intimacy with a "self-taught philosopher, astronomer and
  mathematician," as Sir Walter Scott called him, of great local
  fame&mdash;James Veitch of Inchbonny, who was particularly skilful in
  making telescopes. Though he duly finished his theological course and was
  licensed to preach, Brewster's preference for other pursuits prevented
  him from engaging in the active duties of his profession. In 1799 he was
  induced by his fellow-student, Henry Brougham, to study the diffraction
  of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time
  to time in papers to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of London and
  other scientific journals, and were admirably and impartially summarized
  by James D. Forbes in his preliminary dissertation to the eighth edition
  of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>. The fact that other philosophers,
  notably Etienne Louis Malus and Augustin Fresnel, were pursuing the same
  investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's
  claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the
  priority must be assigned to others.</p>

  <p>The most important subjects of his inquiries are enumerated by Forbes
  under the following five heads:&mdash;(1) The laws of polarization by
  reflection and refraction, and other quantitative laws of phenomena; (2)
  The discovery of the polarizing structure induced by heat and pressure;
  (3) The discovery of crystals with two axes of double refraction, and
  many of the laws of their phenomena, including the connexion of optical
  structure and crystalline forms; (4) The laws of metallic reflection; (5)
  Experiments on the absorption of light. In this line of investigation the
  prime importance belongs to the discovery (1) of the connexion between
  the refractive index and the polarizing angle, (2) of biaxial crystals,
  and (3) of the production of double refraction by irregular heating.
  These discoveries were promptly recognized. So early as the year 1807 the
  degree of LL.D. was conferred upon Brewster by Marischal College,
  Aberdeen; in 1815 he was made a member of the Royal Society of London,
  and received the Copley medal; in 1818 he received the Rumford medal of
  the society; and in 1816 the French Institute awarded him one-half of the
  prize of three thousand francs for the two most important discoveries in
  physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years. Among the
  non-scientific public his fame was spread more effectually by his
  rediscovery about 1815 of the kaleidoscope, for which there was a great
  demand in both England and America. An instrument of higher interest, the
  stereoscope, which, though of much later date (1849-1850), may be
  mentioned here, since along with the kaleidoscope it did more than
  anything else to popularize his name, was not, as has often been
  asserted, the invention of Brewster. Sir Charles Wheatstone discovered
  its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a
  cumbrous but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were
  made to combine by means of mirrors. To Brewster is due the merit of
  suggesting the use of lenses for the purpose of uniting the dissimilar
  pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly be said
  to be his invention. A much more valuable practical result of Brewster's
  optical researches was the improvement of the British lighthouse system.
  It is true that the dioptric apparatus was perfected independently by
  Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into
  operation. But it is indisputable that Brewster was earlier in the field
  than Fresnel; that he described the dioptric apparatus in 1812; that he
  pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two
  years before Fresnel suggested it; and that it was finally introduced
  into British lighthouses mainly by his persistent efforts.</p>

  <p>Brewster's own discoveries, important though they were, were not his
  only, perhaps not even his chief, service to science. He began literary
  work in 1799 as a regular contributor to the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>,
  of which he acted as editor at the age of twenty. In 1807 he undertook
  the editorship of the newly projected <i>Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</i>, of
  which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The
  work was strongest in the scientific department, and many of its most
  valuable articles were from the pen of the editor. At a later period he
  was one of the leading contributors to the <i>Encyclopaedia
  Britannica</i> (seventh and eighth editions), the articles on
  Electricity, Hydrodynamics, Magnetism, Microscope, Optics, Stereoscope,
  Voltaic Electricity, &amp;c., being from his pen. In 1819 Brewster
  undertook further editorial work by establishing, in conjunction with
  Robert Jameson (1774-1854), the <i>Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</i>,
  which took the place of the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>. The first ten
  volumes (1819-1824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster
  and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825-1826) being edited by
  Jameson alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the
  <i>Edinburgh Journal of Science</i> in 1824, sixteen volumes of which
  appeared under his editorship during the years 1824-1832, with very many
  articles from his own pen. To the transactions of various learned
  societies he contributed from first to last between three and four
  hundred papers, and few of his contemporaries wrote so much for the
  various reviews. In the <i>North British Review</i> alone seventy-five
  articles of his appeared. A list of his larger separate works will be
  found below. Special mention, however, must be made of the most important
  of them all&mdash;his biography of Sir Isaac Newton. In 1831 he published
  a short popular account of the philosopher's life in Murray's <i>Family
  Library</i>; but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the much
  fuller <i>Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir Isaac
  Newton</i>, a work which embodied the results of more than twenty years'
  patient investigation of original manuscripts and all other available
  sources.</p>

  <p>Brewster's relations as editor brought him into frequent communication
  with the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the
  first to recognize the benefit that would accrue from regular intercourse
  among workers in the field of science. In an article in the <i>Quarterly
  Review</i> he threw out a suggestion for "an association of our nobility,
  clergy, gentry and philosophers," which was taken up by others and found
  speedy realization in the British Association for the Advancement of <!--

  p.0514]</span>Science. Its first meeting was held at York in 1831; and
  Brewster, along with Charles Babbage and Sir John F. W. Herschel, had the
  chief part in shaping its constitution. In the same year in which the
  British Association held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour
  of knighthood and the decoration of the Guelphic order of Hanover. In
  1838 he was appointed principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and
  St Leonard, St Andrews. In 1849 he acted as president of the British
  Association and was elected one of the eight foreign associates of the
  Institute of France in succession to J.J. Berzelius; and ten years later
  he accepted the office of principal of the university of Edinburgh, the
  duties of which he discharged until within a few months of his death,
  which took place at Allerly, Melrose, on the 10th of February 1868.</p>

  <p>In estimating Brewster's place among scientific discoverers the chief
  thing to be borne in mind is that the bent of his genius was not
  characteristically mathematical. His method was empirical, and the laws
  which he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To
  the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he
  contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy in this connexion that if he
  did not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never
  explicitly adopted the undulatory theory of light. Few will be inclined
  to dispute the verdict of Forbes:&mdash;"His scientific glory is
  different in kind from that of Young and Fresnel; but the discoverer of
  the law of polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and
  of double refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank
  in the intellectual history of the age." In addition to the various works
  of Brewster already noticed, the following may be mentioned:&mdash;Notes
  and Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's <i>Elements of
  Geometry</i> (1824); <i>Treatise on Optics</i> (1831); <i>Letters on
  Natural Magic,</i> addressed to Sir Walter Scott (1831); <i>The Martyrs
  of Science, or the Lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler</i> (1841);
  <i>More Worlds than One</i> (1854).</p>

  <p><b>BREWSTER, WILLIAM</b> (c. 1566-1644), American colonist, one of the
  leaders of the "Pilgrims," was born at Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire,
  England, about 1566. After studying for a short time at Cambridge, he was
  from 1584 to 1587 in the service of William Davison (? 1541-1608), who in
  1585 went to the Low Countries to negotiate an alliance with the
  states-general and in 1586 became assistant to Walsingham, Queen
  Elizabeth's secretary of state. Upon the disgrace of Davison, Brewster
  removed to Scrooby, where from 1590 until September 1607 he held the
  position of "Post," or postmaster responsible for the relays of horses on
  the post road, having previously, for a short time, assisted his father
  in that office. About 1602 his neighbours began to assemble for worship
  at his home, the Scrooby manor house, and in 1606 he joined them in
  organizing the Separatist church of Scrooby. After an unsuccessful
  attempt in 1607 (for which he was imprisoned for a short time), he, with
  other Separatists, removed to Holland in 1608 to obtain greater freedom
  of worship. At Leiden in 1609 he was chosen ruling elder of the
  Congregation. In Holland he supported himself first by teaching English
  and afterwards in 1616-1619, as the partner of one Thomas Brewer, by
  secretly printing, for sale in England, books proscribed by the English
  government, thus, says Bradford, having "imploymente inough." In 1619
  their types were seized and Brewer was arrested by the authorities of the
  university of Leiden, acting on the instance of the British ambassador,
  Sir Dudley Carleton. Brewster, however, escaped, and in the same year,
  with Robert Cushman (c. 1580-1625), obtained in London, on behalf of his
  associates, a land patent from the Virginia Company. In 1620 he emigrated
  to America on the "Mayflower," and was one of the founders of the
  Plymouth Colony. Here besides continuing until his death to act as ruling
  elder, he was also&mdash;regularly until the arrival of the first pastor,
  Ralph Smith (d. 1661), in 1629 and irregularly afterward&mdash;a
  "teacher," preaching "both powerfully and profitably to ye great
  contentment of ye hearers and their comfortable edification." By many he
  is regarded as pre-eminently the leader of the "Pilgrims." He died,
  probably on the 10th of April 1644.</p>

  <p><b>BRÉZÉ</b> the name of a noble Angevin family, the most famous
  member of which was <span class="sc">Pierre de Brézé</span> (<i>c.</i>
  1410-1465), one of the trusted soldiers and statesmen of Charles VII. He
  had made his name as a soldier in the English wars when in 1433 he joined
  with Yolande, queen of Sicily, the constable Richmond and others, in
  chasing from power Charles VII.'s minister La Trémoille. He was knighted
  by Charles of Anjou in 1434, and presently entered the royal council. In
  1437 he became seneschal of Anjou, and in 1440 of Poitou. During the
  Praguerie he rendered great service to the royal cause against the
  dauphin Louis and the revolted nobles, a service which was remembered
  against him after Louis's accession to the throne. He fought against the
  English in Normandy in 1440-1441, and in Guienne in 1442. In the next
  year he became chamberlain to Charles VII., and gained the chief power in
  the state through the influence of Agnes Sorel, superseding his early
  allies Richmond and Charles of Anjou. The six years (1444-1450) of his
  ascendancy were the most prosperous period of the reign of Charles VII.
  His most dangerous opponent was the dauphin Louis, who in 1448 brought
  against him accusations which led to a formal trial resulting in a
  complete exoneration of Brézé and his restoration to favour. He fought in
  Normandy in 1450-1451, and became seneschal of the province after the
  death of Agnes Sorel and the consequent decline of his influence at
  court. He made an ineffective descent on the English coast at Sandwich in
  1457, and was preparing an expedition in favour of Margaret of Anjou when
  the accession of Louis XI. brought him disgrace and a short imprisonment.
  In 1462, however, his son Jacques married Louis's half-sister, Charlotte
  de Valois, daughter of Agnes Sorel. In 1462 he accompanied Margaret to
  Scotland with a force of 2000 men, and after the battle of Hexham he
  brought her back to Flanders. On his return he was reappointed seneschal
  of Normandy, and fell in the battle of Montlhéry on the 16th of July
  1465. He was succeeded as seneschal of Normandy by his eldest son Jacques
  de Brézé (<i>c.</i> 1440-1490), count of Maulevrier; and by his grandson,
  husband of the famous Diane de Poitiers, Louis de Brézé (d. 1531), whose
  tomb in Rouen cathedral, attributed to Jean Goujon and Jean Cousin, is a
  splendid example of French Renaissance work.</p>

  <p>The lordship of Brézé passed eventually to Claire Clémence de Maillé,
  princess of Condé, by whom it was sold to Thomas Dreux, who took the name
  of Dreux Brézé, when it was erected into a marquisate. <span
  class="sc">Henri Evrard</span>, marquis de Dreux-Brézé (1762-1829),
  succeeded his father as master of the ceremonies to Louis XVI. in 1781.
  On the meeting of the states-general in 1789 it fell to him to regulate
  the questions of etiquette and precedence between the three estates. That
  as the immediate representative of the crown he should wound the
  susceptibilities of the deputies was perhaps inevitable, but little
  attempt was made to adapt traditional etiquette to changed circumstances.
  Brézé did not formally intimate to President Bailly the proclamation of
  the royal séance until the 20th of June, when the carpenters were about
  to enter the hall to prepare for the event, thus provoking the session in
  the tennis court. After the royal séance Brézé was sent to reiterate
  Louis's orders that the estates should meet separately, when Mirabeau
  replied that the hall could not be cleared except by force. After the
  fall of the Tuileries Brézé emigrated for a short time, but though he
  returned to France he was spared during the Terror. At the Restoration he
  was made a peer of France, and resumed his functions as guardian of an
  antiquated ceremonial. He died on the 27th of January 1829, when he was
  succeeded in the peerage and at court by his son Scipion (1793-1845).</p>

  <p>The best contemporary account of Pierre de Brézé is given in the
  <i>Chroniques</i> of the Burgundian chronicler, Georges Chastellain, who
  had been his secretary. Chastellain addressed a <i>Déprécation</i> to
  Louis XI. on his behalf at the time of his disgrace.</p>

  <p><b>BRIALMONT, HENRI ALEXIS</b> (1821-1903), Belgian general and
  military engineer, son of General Laurent Mathieu Brialmont (d. 1885),
  was born at Venlo in Limburg on the 25th of May 1821. Educated at the
  Brussels military school, he entered the army as sub-lieutenant of
  engineers in 1843, and became lieutenant in 1847. From 1847 to 1850 he
  was private secretary to the war minister, General Baron Chazal. In 1855
  he entered the staff corps, became major in 1861, lieutenant-colonel
  1864, colonel in 1868 and major-general 1874. In this rank he held at
  first the position of director of fortifications in the Antwerp district
  (December 1874), and nine months later he became inspector-general of
  fortifications and of the corps of engineers. In 1877 he became
  lieutenant-general. His far-reaching schemes for the fortification of the
  Belgian places met with no little opposition, and Brialmont seems to have
  felt much disappointment in this; at any rate he went in 1883 to Rumania
  to advise as to the fortification works required for the defence of the
  country, and presided over the elaboration of the scheme by which
  Bucharest was to be made a first-class fortress. He was thereupon placed
  <i>en disponibilité</i> in his own service, as having undertaken the
  Bucharest works without the authorization of his sovereign. This was due
  in part to the suggestion of Austria, which power regarded the Bucharest
  works as a menace to herself. His services were, however, too valuable to
  be lost, and on his return to Belgium in 1884 he resumed his command of
  the Antwerp military district. He had, further, while in eastern Europe,
  prepared at the request of the Hellenic government, a scheme for the
  defence of Greece. He retired in 1886, but continued to supervise the
  Rumanian defences. He died on the 21st of September 1903.</p>

  <p>In the first stage of his career as an engineer Brialmont's plans
  followed with but slight modification the ideas of Vauban; and his
  original scheme for fortifying Antwerp provided for both enceinte and
  forts being on a bastioned trace. But in 1859, when the great entrenched
  camp at Antwerp was finally taken in hand, he had already gone over to
  the school of polygonal fortification and the ideas of Montalembert.
  About twenty years later Brialmont's own types and plans began to stand
  out amidst the general confusion of ideas on fortification which
  naturally resulted from the introduction of long-range guns, and from the
  events of 1870-71. The extreme detached forts of the Antwerp region and
  the fortifications on the Meuse at Liége and Namur were constructed in
  accordance with Brialmont's final principles, viz. the lavish use of
  armour to protect the artillery inside the forts, the suppression of all
  artillery positions open to overhead fire, and the multiplication of
  intermediate batteries (see <span class="sc">Fortification and
  Siegecraft</span>). In his capacity of inspector-general Brialmont
  drafted and carried out the whole scheme for the defences of Belgium. He
  was an indefatigable writer, and produced, besides essays, reviews and
  other papers in the journals, twenty-three important works and forty-nine
  pamphlets. In 1850 he originated the <i>Journal de l'armée Belge</i>. His
  most important publications were <i>La Fortification du temps présent</i>
  (Brussels, 1885); <i>Influence du tir plongeant et des obus-torpilles sur
  la fortification</i> (Brussels, 1888); <i>Les Régions fortifiées</i>
  (Brussels, 1890); <i>La Défense des états et la fortification à la fin du
  XIX<sup>e</sup> siècle</i> (Brussels, 1895); <i>Progrès de la défense des
  états et de la fortification permanente depuis Vauban</i> (Brussels,
  1898).</p>

  <p><b>BRIAN</b> (926-1014), king of Ireland, known as <span
  class="sc">Brian Boru</span>, <span class="sc">Boroma</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Boroimhe</span> (from <i>boroma</i>, an Irish word for
  tribute), was a son of a certain Kennedy or Cenneide (d. 951). He passed
  his youth in fighting against the Danes, who were constantly ravaging
  Munster, the northern part of which district was the home of Brian's
  tribe, and won much fame in these encounters. In 976 his brother,
  Mathgamhain or Mahon, who had become king of Thomond about 951 and
  afterwards king of Munster, was murdered; Brian avenged this deed, became
  himself king of Munster in 978, and set out upon his career of conquest.
  He forced the tribes of Munster and then those of Leinster to own his
  sovereignty, defeated the Danes, who were established around Dublin, in
  Wicklow, and marched into Dublin, and after several reverses compelled
  Malachy (Maelsechlainn), the chief king of Ireland, who ruled in Meath,
  to bow before him in 1002. Connaught was his next objective. Here and
  also in Ulster he was successful, everywhere he received hostages and
  tribute, and he was generally recognized as the <i>ardri</i>, or chief
  king of Ireland. After a period of comparative quiet Brian was again at
  war with the Danes of Dublin, and on the 23rd of April 1014 his forces
  gained a great victory over them at Clontarf. After this battle, however,
  the old king was slain in his tent, and was buried at Armagh. Brian has
  enjoyed a great and not undeserved reputation. One of his charters is
  still preserved in Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

  <p><b>BRIANÇON,</b> a strongly fortified town in the department of
  Hautes-Alpes in S.E. France. It is built at a height of 4334 ft. on a
  plateau which dominates the junction of the Durance with the Guisane. The
  town itself is formed of very steep and narrow, though picturesque
  streets. As it lies at the foot of the descent from the Mont Genèvre
  Pass, giving access to Turin, a great number of fortifications have been
  constructed on the heights around Briançon, especially towards the east.
  The Fort Janus is no less than 4000 ft. above the town. The parish
  church, with its two towers, was built 1703-1726, and occupies a very
  conspicuous position. The Pont d'Asfeld, E. of the town, was built in
  1734, and forms an arch of 131 ft. span, thrown at a height of 184 ft.
  across the Durance. The modern town extends in the plain at the S.W. foot
  of the plateau on which the old town is built and forms the suburb of Ste
  Catherine, with the railway station, and an important silk-weaving
  factory. Briançon is 51½ m. by rail from Gap. The commune had a civil
  population in 1906 of 4883 (urban population 3130), while the permanent
  garrison was 2641&mdash;in all 7524 inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Briançon was the <i>Brigantium</i> of the Romans and formed part of
  the kingdom of King Cottius. About 1040 it came into the hands of the
  counts of Albon (later dauphins of the Viennois) and thenceforth shared
  the fate of the Dauphiné. The Briançonnais included not merely the upper
  valley of the Durance (with those of its affluents, the Gyronde and the
  Guil), but also the valley of the Dora Riparia (Césanne, Oulx,
  Bardonnèche and Exilles), and that of the Chisone (Fénestrelles, Pérouse,
  Pragelas)&mdash;these glens all lying on the eastern slope of the chain
  of the Alps. But by the treaty of Utrecht (1713) all these valleys were
  handed over to Savoy in exchange for that of Barcelonnette, on the west
  slope of the Alps. In 1815 Briançon successfully withstood a siege of
  three months at the hands of the Allies, a feat which is commemorated by
  an inscription on one of its gates, <i>Le passé répond de
  l'avenir</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BRIAND, ARISTIDE</b> (1862- ), French statesman, was born at
  Nantes, of a bourgeois family. He studied law, and while still young took
  to politics, associating himself with the most advanced movements,
  writing articles for the anarchist journal <i>Le Peuple</i>, and
  directing the <i>Lanterne</i> for some time. From this he passed to the
  <i>Petite République</i>, leaving it to found, with Jean Jaurès,
  <i>L'Humanité</i>. At the same time he was prominent in the movement for
  the formation of labour unions, and at the congress of working men at
  Nantes in 1894 he secured the adoption of the labour union idea against
  the adherents of Jules Guesde. From that time, Briand became one of the
  leaders of the French Socialist party. In 1902, after several
  unsuccessful attempts, he was elected deputy. He declared himself a
  strong partisan of the union of the Left in what is known as the
  <i>Bloc</i>, in order to check the reactionary deputies of the Right.
  From the beginning of his career in the chamber of deputies, Briand was
  occupied with the question of the separation of church and state. He was
  appointed reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the
  law, and his masterly report at once marked him out as one of the coming
  leaders. He succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight
  modifications, and without dividing the parties upon whose support he
  relied. He was the principal author of the law of separation, but, not
  content with preparing it, he wished to apply it as well, especially as
  the existing Rouvier <!-- Page 516 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page516"></a>[v.04 p.0516]</span>ministry allowed disturbances to
  occur during the taking of inventories of church property, a clause of
  the law for which Briand was not responsible. Consequently he accepted
  the portfolio of public instruction and worship in the Sarrien ministry
  (1906). So far as the chamber was concerned his success was complete. But
  the acceptance of a portfolio in a bourgeois ministry led to his
  exclusion from the Unified Socialist party (March 1906). As opposed to
  Jaurès, he contended that the Socialists should co-operate actively with
  the Radicals in all matters of reform, and not stand aloof to await the
  complete fulfilment of their ideals.</p>

  <p><b>BRIANZA,</b> a district of Lombardy, Italy, forming the south part
  of the province of Como, between the two southern arms of the lake of

  being hilly is a favourite summer resort of the Milanese.</p>

  <p><b>BRIARE,</b> a town of north-central France in the department of
  Loiret on the right bank of the Loire, 45½ m. S.E. of Orléans on the
  railway to Nevers. Pop. (1906) 4613. Briare, the <i>Brivodorum</i> of the
  Romans, is situated at the extremity of the Canal of Briare, which unites
  the Loire and its lateral canal with the Loing and so with the Seine. The
  canal of Briare was constructed from 1605 to 1642 and is about 36 m.
  long. The industries include the manufacture of fine pottery, and of
  so-called porcelain buttons made of felspar and milk by a special
  process; its inventor, Bapterosses, has a bust in the town. The canal
  traffic is in wood, iron, coal, building materials, &amp;c. A modern
  hospital and church, and the hôtel de ville installed in an old moated
  château, are the chief buildings. The lateral canal of the Loire crosses
  the Loire near Briare by a fine canal-bridge 720 yds. in length.</p>

  <p><b>BRIAREUS,</b> or <span class="sc">Aegaeon</span>, in Greek
  mythology, one of the three hundred-armed, fifty-headed Hecatoncheires,
  brother of Cottus and Gyges (or Gyes). According to Homer (<i>Iliad</i>
  i. 403) he was called Aegaeon by men, and Briareus by the gods. He was
  the son of Poseidon (or Uranus) and Gaea. The legends regarding him and
  his brothers are various and somewhat contradictory. According to the
  most widely spread myth, Briareus and his brothers were called by Zeus to
  his assistance when the Titans were making war upon Olympus. The gigantic
  enemies were defeated and consigned to Tartarus, at the gates of which
  the three brothers were placed (Hesiod, <i>Theog.</i> 624, 639, 714).
  Other accounts make Briareus one of the assailants of Olympus, who, after
  his defeat, was buried under Mount Aetna (Callimachus, <i>Hymn to
  Delos</i>, 141). Homer mentions him as assisting Zeus when the other
  Olympian deities were plotting against the king of gods and men
  (<i>Iliad</i> i. 398). Another tradition makes him a giant of the sea,
  ruler of the fabulous Aegaea in Euboea, an enemy of Poseidon and the
  inventor of warships (Schol. on Apoll. Rhod. i. 1165). It would be
  difficult to determine exactly what natural phenomena are symbolized by
  the Hecatoncheires. They may represent the gigantic forces of nature
  which appear in earthquakes and other convulsions, or the multitudinous
  motion of the sea waves (Mayer, <i>Die Giganten und Titanen</i>,
  1887).</p>

  <p><b>BRIBERY</b> (from the O. Fr. <i>briberie</i>, begging or vagrancy,
  <i>bribe</i>, Mid. Lat. <i>briba</i>, signifying a piece of bread given
  to beggars; the Eng. "bribe" has passed through the meanings of alms,
  blackmail and extortion, to gifts received or given in order to influence
  corruptly). The public offence of bribery may be defined as the offering
  or giving of payment in some shape or form that it may be a motive in the
  performance of functions for which the proper motive ought to be a
  conscientious sense of duty. When this is superseded by the sordid
  impulses created by the bribe, a person is said to be corrupted, and thus
  corruption is a term sometimes held equivalent to bribery. The offence
  may be divided into two great classes&mdash;the one where a person
  invested with power is induced by payment to use it unjustly; the other,
  where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages of those who can
  impart it. It is a natural propensity, removable only by civilization or
  some powerful counteracting influence, to feel that every element of
  power is to be employed as much as possible for the owner's own behoof,
  and that its benefits should be conferred not on those who best deserve
  them, but on those who will pay most for them. Hence judicial corruption
  is an inveterate vice of imperfect civilization. There is, perhaps no
  other crime on which the force of law, if unaided by public opinion and
  morals, can have so little influence; for in other crimes, such as
  violence or fraud, there is generally some person immediately injured by
  the act, who can give his aid in the detection of the offender, but in
  the perpetration of the offence of bribery all the immediate parties
  obtain what they desire, and are satisfied.</p>

  <p>The purification of the bench from judicial bribery has been gradual
  in most of the European countries. In France it received an impulse in
  the 16th century from the high-minded chancellor, Michel de L'Hôpital. In
  England judicial corruption has been a crime of remarkable rarity.
  Indeed, with the exception of a statute of 1384 (repealed by the Statute
  Law Revision Act 1881) there has been no legislation relating to judicial
  bribery. The earliest recorded case was that of Sir William Thorpe, who
  in 1351 was fined and removed from office for accepting bribes. Other
  celebrated cases were those of Michael de la Pole, chancellor of England,
  in 1387; Lord Chancellor Bacon in 1621; Lionel Cranfield, earl of
  Middlesex, in 1624; and Sir Thomas Parker, 1st earl of Macclesfield, in
  1725. In Scotland for some years after the Revolution the bench was not
  without a suspicion of interested partiality; but since the beginning of
  the 19th century, at least, there has been in all parts of the empire a
  perfect reliance on its purity. The same may be said of the higher class
  of ministerial officers. There is no doubt that in the period from the
  Revolution to the end of Queen Anne's reign, when a speaker of the House
  of Commons was expelled for bribery, and the great Marlborough could not
  clear his character from pecuniary dishonesty, there was much corruption
  in the highest official quarters. The level of the offence of official
  bribery has gradually descended, until it has become an extremely rare
  thing for the humbler officers connected with the revenue to be charged
  with it. It has had a more lingering existence with those who, because
  their power is more of a constitutional than an official character, have
  been deemed less responsible to the public. During Walpole's
  administration there is no doubt that members of parliament were paid in
  cash for votes; and the memorable saying, that every man has his price,
  has been preserved as a characteristic indication of his method of
  government. One of the forms in which administrative corruption is most
  difficult of eradication is the appointment to office. It is sometimes
  maintained that the purity which characterizes the administration of
  justice is here unattainable, because in giving a judgment there is but
  one form in which it can be justly given, but when an office has to be
  filled many people may be equally fitted for it, and personal motives
  must influence a choice. It very rarely happens, however, that direct
  bribery is supposed to influence such appointments. It does not appear
  that bribery was conspicuous in England until, in the early part of the
  18th century, constituencies had thrown off the feudal dependence which
  lingered among them; and, indeed, it is often said, that bribery is
  essentially the defect of a free people, since it is the sale of that
  which is taken from others without payment.</p>

  <p>In English law bribery of a privy councillor or a juryman (see <span
  class="sc">Embracery</span>) is punishable as a misdemeanour, as is the
  taking of a bribe by any judicial or ministerial officer. The buying and
  selling of public offices is also regarded at common law as a form of
  bribery. By the Customs Consolidation Act 1876, any officer in the
  customs service is liable to instant dismissal and a penalty of £500 for
  taking a bribe, and any person offering or promising a bribe or reward to
  an officer to neglect his duty or conceal or connive at any act by which
  the customs may be evaded shall forfeit the sum of £200. Under the Inland
  Revenue Regulations Act 1890, the bribery of commissioners, collectors,
  officers or other persons employed in relation to the Inland Revenue
  involves a fine of £500. The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, ss. 112 and 398,
  makes provision for certain offences in the nature of bribery. Bribery
  is, by the Extradition Act 1906, <!-- Page 517 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page517"></a>[v.04 p.0517]</span>an extraditable
  offence. Administrative corruption was dealt with in the Public Bodies'
  Corrupt Practices Act 1889. The public bodies concerned are county
  councils, town or borough councils, boards, commissioners, select
  vestries and other bodies having local government, public health or poor
  law powers, and having for those purposes to administer rates raised
  under public general acts. The giving or receiving, promising, offering,
  soliciting or agreeing to receive any gift, fee, loan or advantage by any
  person as an inducement for any act or forbearance by a member, officer
  or servant of a public body in regard to the affairs of that body is made
  a misdemeanour in England and Ireland and a crime and offence in
  Scotland. Prosecution under the act requires the consent of the attorney
  or solicitor-general in England or Ireland and of the lord advocate in
  Scotland. Conviction renders liable to imprisonment with or without hard
  labour for a term not exceeding two years, and to a fine not exceeding
  £500, in addition to or in lieu of imprisonment. The offender may also be
  ordered to pay to the public body concerned any bribe received by him; he
  may be adjudged incapable for seven years of holding public office,
  <i>i.e.</i> the position of member, officer or servant of a public body;
  and if already an officer or servant, besides forfeiting his place, he is
  liable at the discretion of the court to forfeit his right to
  compensation or pension. On a second conviction he may be adjudged
  forever incapable of holding public office, and for seven years incapable
  of being registered or of voting as a parliamentary elector, or as an
  elector of members of a public body. An offence under the act may be
  prosecuted and punished under any other act applicable thereto, or at
  common law; but no person is to be punished twice for the same offence.
  Bribery at political elections was at common law punishable by indictment
  or information, but numerous statutes have been passed dealing with it as
  a "corrupt practice." In this sense, the word is elastic in meaning and
  may embrace any method of corruptly influencing another for the purpose
  of securing his vote (see <span class="sc">Corrupt Practices</span>).
  Bribery at elections of fellows, scholars, officers and other persons in
  colleges, cathedral and collegiate churches, hospitals and other
  societies was prohibited in 1588-1589 by statute (31 Eliz. c. 6). If a
  member receives any money, fee, reward or other profit for giving his
  vote in favour of any candidate, he forfeits his own place; if for any
  such consideration he resigns to make room for a candidate, he forfeits
  double the amount of the bribe, and the candidate by or on whose behalf a
  bribe is given or promised is incapable of being elected on that
  occasion. The act is to be read at every election of fellows, &amp;c.,
  under a penalty of £40 in case of default. By the same act any person for
  corrupt consideration presenting, instituting or inducting to an
  ecclesiastical benefice or dignity forfeits two years' value of the
  benefice or dignity; the corrupt presentation is void, and the right to
  present lapses for that turn to the crown, and the corrupt presentee is
  disabled from thereafter holding the same benefice or dignity; a corrupt
  institution or induction is void, and the patron may present. For a
  corrupt resignation or exchange of a benefice the giver and taker of a
  bribe forfeit each double the amount of the bribe. Any person corruptly
  procuring the ordaining of ministers or granting of licenses to preach
  forfeits £40, and the person so ordained forfeits £10 and for seven years
  is incapacitated from holding any ecclesiastical benefice or
  promotion.</p>

  <p>In the United States the offence of bribery is very severely dealt
  with. In many states, bribery or the attempt to bribe is made a felony,
  and is punishable with varying terms of imprisonment, in some
  jurisdictions it may be with a period not exceeding ten years. The
  offence of bribery at elections is dealt with on much the same lines as
  in England, voiding the election and disqualifying the offender from
  holding any office.</p>

  <p>Bribery may also take the form of a secret commission (<i>q.v.</i>), a
  profit made by an agent, in the course of his employment, without the
  knowledge of his principal.</p>

  <p><b>BRIC À BRAC</b> (a French word, formed by a kind of onomatopoeia,
  meaning a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends; cf. <i>de bric et de
  broc</i>, corresponding to our "by hook or by crook"; or by reduplication
  from <i>brack</i>, refuse), objects of "virtu," a collection of old
  furniture, china, plate and curiosities.</p>

  <p><b>BRICK</b> (derived according to some etymologists from the Teutonic
  <i>bricke</i>, a disk or plate; but more authoritatively, through the
  French <i>brique</i>, originally a "broken piece," applied especially to
  bread, and so to clay, from the Teutonic <i>brikan</i>, to break), a kind
  of artificial stone generally made of burnt clay, and largely used as a
  building material.</p>

  <p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The art of making bricks dates from very early
  times, and was practised by all the civilized nations of antiquity. The
  earliest burnt bricks known are those found on the sites of the ancient
  cities of Babylonia, and it seems probable that the method of making
  strong and durable bricks, by burning blocks of dried clay, was
  discovered in this corner of Asia. We know at least that well-burnt
  bricks were made by the Babylonians more than 6000 years ago, and that
  they were extensively used in the time of Sargon of Akkad (<i>c.</i> 3800
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>). The site of the ancient city of Babylon
  is still marked by huge mounds of bricks, the ruins of its great walls,
  towers and palaces, although it has been the custom for centuries to
  carry away from these heaps the bricks required for the building of the
  modern towns in the surrounding country. The Babylonians and Assyrians
  attained to a high degree of proficiency in brickmaking, notably in the
  manufacture of bricks having a coating of coloured glaze or enamel, which
  they largely used for wall decoration. The Chinese claim great antiquity
  for their clay industries, but it is not improbable that the knowledge of
  brickmaking travelled eastwards from Babylonia across the whole of Asia.
  It is believed that the art of making glazed bricks, so highly developed
  afterwards by the Chinese, found its way across Asia from the west,
  through Persia and northern India, to China. The great wall of China was
  constructed partly of brick, both burnt and unburnt; but this was built
  at a comparatively late period (<i>c.</i> 210 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), and there is nothing to show that the Chinese
  had any knowledge of burnt bricks when the art flourished in
  Babylonia.</p>

  <p>Brickmaking formed the chief occupation of the Israelites during their
  bondage in Egypt, but in this case the bricks were probably sun-dried
  only, and not burnt. These bricks were made of a mixture of clay and
  chopped straw or reeds, worked into a stiff paste with water. The clay
  was the river mud from the banks of the Nile, and as this had not
  sufficient cohesion in itself, the chopped straw (or reeds) was added as
  a binding material. The addition of such substances increases the
  plasticity of wet clay, especially if the mixture is allowed to stand for
  some days before use; so that the action of the chopped straw was
  twofold; a fact possibly known to the Egyptians. These sun-dried bricks,
  or "adobes," are still made, as of old, on the banks of the Nile by the
  following method:&mdash;A shallow pit or bed is prepared, into which are
  thrown the mud, chopped straw and water in suitable proportions, and the
  whole mass is tramped on until it is thoroughly mixed and of the proper
  consistence. This mixture is removed in lumps and shaped into bricks, in
  moulds or by hand, the bricks being simply sun-dried.</p>

  <p>Pliny mentions that three kinds of bricks were made by the Greeks, but
  there is no indication that they were used to any great extent, and
  probably the walls of Athens on the side towards Mount Hymettus were the
  most important brick-structures in ancient Greece. The Romans became
  masters of the brickmaker's art, though they probably acquired much of
  their knowledge in the East, during their occupation of Egypt and Greece.
  In any case they revived and extended the manufacture of bricks about the
  beginning of the Christian era; exercising great care in the selection
  and preparation of their clay, and introducing the method of burning
  bricks in kilns. They carried their knowledge and their methods
  throughout western Europe, and there is abundant evidence that they made
  bricks extensively in Germany and in Britain.</p>

  <p>Although brickmaking was thus introduced into Britain nearly 2000
  years ago, the art seems to have been lost when the Romans withdrew from
  the country, and it is doubtful whether any burnt bricks were made in
  England from that time until the 13th century. Such bricks as were used
  during this long <!-- Page 518 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page518"></a>[v.04 p.0518]</span>period were generally taken from
  the remains of Roman buildings, as at Colchester and St Albans Abbey. One
  of the earliest existing brick buildings, erected after the revival of
  brickmaking in England, is Little Wenham Hall, in Suffolk, built about
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1210; but it was not until the 15th
  century that bricks came into general use again, and then only for
  important edifices. During the reign of Henry VIII. brickmaking was
  brought to great perfection, probably by workmen brought from Flanders,
  and the older portions of St James's Palace and Hampton Court Palace
  remain to testify to the skill then attained. In the 16th century bricks
  were increasingly used, but down to the Great Fire of London, in 1666,
  the smaller buildings, shops and dwelling-houses, were constructed of
  timber framework filled in with lath and plaster. In the rebuilding of
  London after the fire, bricks were largely used, and from the end of the
  17th century to the present day they have been almost exclusively used in
  all ordinary buildings throughout the country, except in those districts
  where building stone is plentiful and good brick-clay is not readily
  procurable. The bricks made in England before 1625 were of many sizes,
  there being no recognized standard; but in that year the sizes were
  regulated by statute, and the present standard size was adopted, viz. 9 x
  4½ x 3 in. In 1784 a tax was levied on bricks, which was not repealed
  until 1850. The tax averaged about 4s. 7d. per thousand on ordinary
  bricks, and special bricks were still more heavily taxed.</p>

  <p>The first brick buildings in America were erected on Manhattan Island
  in the year 1633 by a governor of the Dutch West India Company. These
  bricks were made in Holland, where the industry had long reached great
  excellence; and for many years bricks were imported into America from
  Holland and from England. In America burnt bricks were first made at New
  Haven about 1650, and the manufacture slowly spread through the New
  England states; but for many years the home-made article was inferior to
  that imported from Europe.</p>

  <p>The Dutch and the Germans were the great brickmakers of Europe during
  the middle ages, although the Italians, from the 14th to the 15th
  century, revived and developed the art of decorative brick-work or
  terra-cotta, and discovered the method of applying coloured enamels to
  these materials. Under the Della Robbias, in the 15th century, some of
  the finest work of this class that the world has seen was executed, but
  it can scarcely be included under brickwork.</p>

  <p><i>Brick Clays</i>.&mdash;All clays are the result of the denudation
  and decomposition of felspathic and siliceous rocks, and consist of the
  fine insoluble particles which have been carried in suspension in water
  and deposited in geologic basins according to their specific gravity and
  degree of fineness (see <span class="sc">Clay</span>). These deposits
  have been formed in all geologic epochs from the "Recent" to the
  "Cambrian," and they vary in hardness from the soft and plastic
  "alluvial" clays to the hard and rock-like shales and slates of the older
  formations. The alluvial and drift clays (which were alone used for
  brickmaking until modern times) are found near the surface, are readily
  worked and require little preparation, whereas the older sedimentary
  deposits are often difficult to work and necessitate the use of heavy
  machinery. These older shales, or rocky clays, may be brought into
  plastic condition by long weathering (<i>i.e.</i> by exposure to rain,
  frost and sun) or by crushing and grinding in water, and they then
  resemble ordinary alluvial clays in every respect.</p>

  <p>The clays or earths from which burnt bricks are made may be divided
  into two principal types, according to chemical composition: (1) Clays or
  shales containing only a small percentage of carbonate of lime and
  consisting chiefly of hydrated aluminium silicates (the "true clay
  substance") with more or less sand, undecomposed grains of felspar, and
  oxide or carbonate of iron; these clays usually burn to a buff, salmon or
  red colour; (2) Clays containing a considerable percentage of carbonate
  of lime in addition to the substances above mentioned. These latter clay
  deposits are known as "marls,"<a name="FnAnchor_051"
  href="#Footnote_051"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and may contain as much as 40% of
  chalk. They burn to a sulphur-yellow colour which is quite
  distinctive.</p>

  <p>Brick clays of class (1) are very widely distributed, and have a more
  extensive geological range than the marls, which are found in connexion
  with chalk or limestone formations only. These ordinary brick clays vary
  considerably in composition, and many clays, as they are found in nature,
  are unsuitable for brickmaking without the addition of some other kind of
  clay or sand. The strongest brick clays, <i>i.e.</i> those possessing the
  greatest plasticity and tensile strength, are usually those which contain
  the highest percentage of the hydrated aluminium silicates, although the
  exact relation of plasticity to chemical composition has not yet been
  determined. This statement cannot be applied indiscriminately to all
  clays, but may be taken as fairly applicable to clays of one general type
  (see <span class="sc">Clay</span>). All clays contain more or less free
  silica in the form of sand, and usually a small percentage of
  undecomposed felspar. The most important ingredient, after the
  clay-substance and the sand, is oxide of iron; for the colour, and, to a
  less extent, the hardness and durability of the burnt bricks depend on
  its presence. The amount of oxide of iron in these clays varies from
  about 2 to 10%, and the colour of the bricks varies accordingly from
  light buff to chocolate; although the colour developed by a given
  percentage of oxide of iron is influenced by the other substances present
  and also by the method of firing. A clay containing from 5 to 8% of oxide
  of iron will, under ordinary conditions of firing, produce a red brick;
  but if the clay contains 3 to 4% of alkalis, or the brick is fired too
  hard, the colour will be darker and more purple. The actions of the
  alkalis and of increased temperature are probably closely related, for in
  either case the clay is brought nearer to its fusion point, and
  ferruginous clays generally become darker in colour as they approach to
  fusion. Alumina acts in the opposite direction, an excess of this
  compound tending to make the colour lighter and brighter. It is
  impossible to give a typical composition for such clays, as the
  percentages of the different constituents vary through such wide ranges.
  The clay substance may vary from 15 to 80%, the free silica or sand from
  5 to 80%, the oxide of iron from 1 to 10%, the carbonates of lime and
  magnesia together, from 1 to 5%, and the alkalis from 1 to 4%. Organic
  matter is always present, and other impurities which frequently occur are
  the sulphates of lime and magnesia, the chlorides and nitrates of soda
  and potash, and iron-pyrites. The presence of organic matter gives the
  wet clay a greater plasticity, probably because it forms a kind of
  mucilage which adds a certain viscosity and adhesiveness to the natural
  plasticity of the clay. In some of the coal-measure shales the amount of
  organic matter is very considerable, and may render the clay useless for
  brickmaking. The other impurities, all of which, except the pyrites, are
  soluble in water, are undesirable, as they give rise to "scum," which
  produces patchy colour and pitted faces on the bricks. The commonest
  soluble impurity is calcium sulphate, which produces a whitish scum on
  the face of the brick in drying, and as the scum becomes permanently
  fixed in burning, such bricks are of little use except for common work.
  This question of "scumming" is very important to the maker of high-class
  facing and moulded bricks, and where a clay containing calcium sulphate
  must be used, a certain percentage of barium carbonate is nowadays added
  to the wet clay. By this means the calcium sulphate is converted into
  calcium carbonate which is insoluble in water, so that it remains
  distributed throughout the mass of the brick instead of being deposited
  on the surface. The presence of magnesium salts is also very
  objectionable, as these generally remain in the burnt brick as magnesium
  sulphate, which gives rise to an efflorescence of fine white crystals
  after the bricks are built into position. Clays which are strong or
  plastic are known as "fat" clays, and they always contain a high
  percentage of true "clay substance," and, consequently, a low percentage
  of sand. Such clays take up a considerable amount of water in
  "tempering"; they dry slowly, shrink greatly, and so become liable to
  lose their shape and develop cracks in drying and firing. "Fat" clays are
  greatly improved by the addition of coarse sharp sand, <!-- Page 519
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page519"></a>[v.04 p.0519]</span>which
  reduces the time of drying and the shrinkage, and makes the brick more
  rigid during the firing. Coarse sand, unlike clay-substance, is
  practically unaffected during the drying and firing, and is a desirable
  if not a necessary ingredient of all brick clays. The best brick-clays
  feel gritty between the fingers; they should, of course, be free from
  pebbles, sufficiently plastic to be moulded into shape and strong enough
  when dry to be safely handled. All clays are greatly improved by being
  turned over and exposed to the weather, or by standing for some months in
  a wet condition. This "weathering" and "ageing" of clay is particularly
  important where bricks are made from tempered clay, <i>i.e.</i> clay in
  the wet or plastic state; where bricks are made from shale, in the
  semi-plastic condition, weathering is still of importance.</p>

  <p>The lime clays or "marls" of class (2), which contain essentially a
  high percentage of chalk or limestone, are not so widely distributed as
  the ordinary brick-clays, and in England the natural deposits of these
  clays have been largely exhausted. A very fine chalk-clay, or "malm" as
  it was locally called, was formerly obtained from the alluvium in the
  vicinity of London; but the available supply of this has been used up,
  and at the present time an artificial "malm" is prepared by mixing an
  ordinary brick-clay with ground chalk. For the best London facing-bricks
  the clay and chalk are mixed in water. The chalk is ground on
  grinding-pans, and the clay is mixed with water and worked about until
  the mixture has the consistence of cream. The mixture of these "pulps" is
  run through a grating or coarse sieve on to a drying-kiln or "bed," where
  it is allowed to stand until stiff enough to walk on. A layer of fine
  ashes is then spread over the clay, and the mass is turned over and mixed
  by spade, and tempered by the addition of water. In other districts,
  where clays containing limestone are used, the marl is mixed with water
  on a wash-pan and the resulting creamy fluid passed through coarse sieves
  on to a drying-bed. If necessary, coarse sand is added to the clay in the
  wash-pan, and such addition is often advisable because the washed clays
  are generally very fine in grain. Another method of treating these marls,
  when they are in the plastic condition, is to squeeze them by machinery
  through iron gratings, which arrest and remove the pebbles. In other
  cases the marl is passed through a grinding-mill having a solid bottom
  and heavy iron rollers, by which means the limestone pebbles are crushed
  sufficiently and mixed through the whole mass. The removal of limestone
  pebbles from the clay is of great importance, as during the firing they
  would be converted into quicklime, which has a tendency to shatter the
  brick on exposure to the weather. As before stated, these marls (which
  usually contain from 15 to 30% of calcium carbonate) burn to a yellow
  colour which is quite distinctive, although in some cases, where the
  percentage of limestone is very high, over 40%, the colour is grey or a
  very pale buff. The action of lime in bleaching the ferric oxide and
  producing a yellow instead of a red brick, has not been thoroughly
  investigated, but it seems probable that some compound is produced,
  between the lime and the oxide of iron, or between these two oxides and
  the free silica, entirely different from that produced by oxide of iron
  in the absence of lime. Such marls require a harder fire than the
  ordinary brick-clays in order to bring about the reaction between the
  lime and the other ingredients. Magnesia may replace lime to some extent
  in such marls, but the firing temperature must be higher when magnesia is
  present. Marls usually contract very little, if at all, in the burning,
  and generally produce a strong, square brick of fine texture and good
  colour. When under-fired, marl bricks are very liable to disintegrate
  under the action of the weather, and great care must be exercised in
  burning them at a sufficiently high temperature.</p>

  <p><i>Brickmaking</i>.&mdash;Bricks made of tempered clay may be made by
  hand or by machine, and the machines may be worked by hand or by
  mechanical power. Bricks made of semi-plastic clay (<i>i.e.</i> ground
  clay or shale sufficiently damp to adhere under pressure) are generally
  machine-made throughout. The method of making bricks by hand is the same,
  with slight variation, the world over. The tempered clay is pressed by
  hand into a wooden or metal mould or four-sided case (without top or
  bottom) which is of the desired shape and size, allowance being made for
  the shrinkage of the brick in drying and firing. The moulder stands at
  the bench or table, dips the mould in water, or water and then sand, to
  prevent the clay from sticking, takes a rudely shaped piece of clay from
  an assistant, and dashes this into the mould which rests on the moulding
  bench. He then presses the clay into the corners of the mould with his
  fingers, scrapes off any surplus clay and levels the top by means of a
  strip of wood called a "strike," and then turns the brick out of the
  mould on to a board, to be carried away by another assistant to the
  drying-ground. The mould may be placed on a special piece of wood, called
  the stock-board, provided with an elevated tongue of wood in the centre,
  which produces the hollow or "frog" in the bottom of the brick.</p>

  <p>Machine-made bricks may be divided into two kinds, plastic and
  semi-plastic, although the same type of machine is often used for both
  kinds.</p>

  <p>The machine-made plastic bricks are made of tempered clay, but
  generally the tempering and working of the clay are effected by the use
  of machinery, especially when the harder clays and shales are used. The
  machines used in the preparation of such clays are grinding-mills and
  pug-mills. The grinding-mills are either a series of rollers with
  graduated spaces between, through which the clay or shale is passed, or
  are of the ordinary "mortar pan" type, having a solid or perforated iron
  bottom on which the clay or shale is crushed by heavy rollers. Shales are
  sometimes passed through a grinding-mill before they are exposed to the
  action of the weather, as the disintegration of the hard lumps of shale
  greatly accelerates the "weathering." In the case of ordinary brick-clay,
  in the plastic condition, grinding-mills are only used when pebbles more
  than a quarter of an inch in diameter are present, as otherwise the clay
  may be passed directly through the pug-mill, a process which may be
  repeated if necessary. The pug-mill consists of a box or trough having a
  feed hole at one end and a delivery hole or nose at the other end, and
  provided with a central shaft which carries knives and cutters so
  arranged that when the shaft revolves they cut and knead the clay, and at
  the same time force it towards and through the delivery nose. The cross
  section of this nose of the pug-mill is approximately the same as that of
  the required brick (9 in. × 4½ in. plus contraction, for ordinary
  bricks), so that the pug delivers a solid or continuous mass of clay from
  which bricks may be made by merely making a series of square cuts at the
  proper distances apart. In practice, the clay is pushed from the pug
  along a smooth iron plate, which is provided with a wire cutting frame
  having a number of tightly stretched wires placed at certain distances
  apart, arranged so that they can be brought down upon, and through, the
  clay, and so many bricks cut off at intervals. The frame is sometimes in
  the form of a skeleton cylinder, the wires being arranged radially (or
  the wires may be replaced by metal disks); but in all cases bricks thus
  made are known as "wire-cuts." In order to obtain a better-shaped and
  more compact brick, these wire-cuts may be placed under a brick press and
  there squeezed into iron moulds under great pressure. These two processes
  are now generally performed by one machine, consisting of pug-mill and
  brick press combined. The pug delivers the clay, downwards, into the
  mould; the proper amount of clay is cut off; and the mould is made to
  travel into position under the ram of the press, which squeezes the clay
  into a solid mass.</p>

  <p>There are many forms of brick press, a few for hand power, but the
  most adapted for belt-driving; although in recent years hydraulic presses
  have come more and more into use, especially in Germany and America. The
  essential parts of a brick press are: (1) a box or frame in which the
  clay is moulded; (2) a plunger or die carried on the end of a ram, which
  gives the necessary pressure; (3) an arrangement for pushing the pressed
  brick out of the moulding box. Such presses are generally made of iron
  throughout, although other metals are used, occasionally, for the moulds
  and dies. The greatest variations found in brick presses are in the means
  adopted for actuating the ram; and many ingenious mechanical devices have
  been applied to this end, each claiming some particular advantage over
  its predecessors. In many recent presses, especially where semi-plastic
  clay is used, the brick is pressed simultaneously from top and bottom, a
  second ram, working upwards from beneath, giving the additional
  pressure.</p>

  <p>Although the best bricks are still pressed from tempered or plastic
  clay, there has recently been a great development in the manufacture of
  semi-plastic or dust-made bricks, especially in those districts where
  shales are used for brickmaking. These semi-plastic bricks are stamped
  out of ground shale that has been sufficiently moistened with water to
  enable it to bind together. The hard-clay, or shale, is crushed under
  heavy rollers in an iron grinding-pan having a perforated bottom through
  which the crushed clay passes, when sufficiently fine, into a small
  compartment underneath. This clay powder is then delivered, by an
  elevator, into a sieve or screen, which retains the coarser particles for
  regrinding. Sets of rollers may also be used for crushing shales that are
  only moderately hard, the ground material being sifted as before. The
  material, as fed <!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page520"></a>[v.04 p.0520]</span>into the mould of the press, is a
  coarse, damp powder which becomes adhesive under pressure, producing a
  so-called "semi-plastic" brick. The presses used are similar to those
  employed for plastic clay, but they are generally more strongly and
  heavily built, and are capable of applying a greater pressure.</p>

  <p>The semi-plastic method has many advantages where shales are used,
  although the bricks are not as strong nor as perfect as the best
  "plastic" bricks. The method, however, enables the brickmaker to make use
  of certain kinds of clay-rock, or shale, that would be impracticable for
  plastic bricks; and the weathering, tempering and "ageing" may be largely
  or entirely dispensed with. The plant required is heavier and more
  costly, but the brickyard becomes more compact, and the processes are
  simpler than with the "plastic" method.</p>

  <p>The drying of bricks, which was formerly done in the open, is now, in
  most cases, conducted in a special shed heated by flues along which the
  heated gases from the kilns pass on their way to the chimney. It is
  important that the atmosphere of the drying-shed should be fairly dry, to
  which end suitable means of ventilation must be arranged (by fans or
  otherwise). If the atmosphere is too moist the surface of the brick
  remains damp for a considerable time, and the moisture from the interior
  passes to the surface as water, carrying with it the soluble salts, which
  are deposited on the surface as the water slowly evaporates. This deposit
  produces the "scum" already referred to. When the drying is done in a dry
  atmosphere the surface quickly dries and hardens, and the moisture from
  the interior passes to the surface as vapour, the soluble salts being
  left distributed through the whole mass, and consequently no "scum" is
  produced. Plastic bricks take much longer to dry than semi-plastic; they
  shrink more and have a greater tendency to warp or twist.</p>

  <p>The burning or firing of bricks is the most important factor in their
  production; for their strength and durability depend very largely on the
  character and degree of the firing to which they have been subjected. The
  action of the heat brings about certain chemical decompositions and
  re-combinations which entirely alter the physical character of the dry
  clay. It is important, therefore, that the firing should be carefully
  conducted and that it should be under proper control. For ordinary bricks
  the firing atmosphere should be oxidizing, and the finishing temperature
  should be adjusted to the nature of the clay, the object being to produce
  a hard strong brick, of good shape, that will not be too porous and will
  withstand the action of frost. The finishing temperature ranges from 900°
  C. to 1250° C., the usual temperature being about 1050° C. for ordinary
  bricks. As before mentioned, lime-clays require a higher firing
  temperature (usually about 1150° C. to 1200° C.) in order to bring the
  lime into chemical combination with the other substances present.</p>

  <p>It is evident that the best method of firing bricks is to place them
  in permanent kilns, but although such kilns were used by the Romans some
  2000 years ago, the older method of firing in "clamps" is still employed
  in the smaller brickfields, in every country where bricks are made. These
  clamps are formed by arranging the unfired bricks in a series of rows or
  walls, placed fairly closely together, so as to form a rectangular stack.
  A certain number of channels, or firemouths, are formed in the bottom of
  the clamp; and fine coal is spread in horizontal layers between the
  bricks during the building up of the stack. Fires are kindled in the
  fire-mouths, and the clamp is allowed to go on burning until the fuel is
  consumed throughout. The clamp is then allowed to cool, after which it is
  taken down, and the bricks sorted; those that are under-fired being built
  up again in the next clamp for refiring. Sometimes the clamp takes the
  form of a temporary kiln, the outside being built of burnt bricks which
  are plastered over with clay, and the fire-mouths being larger and more
  carefully formed. There are many other local modifications in the manner
  of building up the clamps, all with the object of producing a large
  percentage of well-fired bricks. Clamp-firing is slow, and also
  uneconomical, because irregular and not sufficiently under control; and
  it is now only employed where bricks are made on a small scale.</p>

  <p>Brick-kilns are of many forms, but they can all be grouped under two
  main types&mdash;Intermittent kilns and Continuous kilns. The
  intermittent kiln is usually circular in plan, being in the form of a
  vertical cylinder with a domed top. It consists of a single
  firing-chamber in which the unfired bricks are placed, and in the walls
  of which are contrived a number of fire-mouths where wood or coal is
  burned. In the older forms known as <i>up-draught</i> kilns, the products
  of combustion pass from the fire-mouth, through flues, into the bottom of
  the firing-chamber, and thence directly upwards and out at the top. The
  modern plan is to introduce the products of combustion near the top, or
  crown, of the kiln, and to draw them downwards through holes in the
  bottom which lead to flues connected with an independent chimney. These
  <i>down-draught</i> kilns have short chimneys or "bags" built round the
  inside wall in connexion with the fire-mouths, which conduct the flames
  to the upper part of the firing-chamber, where they are reverberated and
  passed down through the bricks in obedience to the pull of the chimney.
  The "bags" may be joined together, forming an inner circular wall
  entirely round the firing-chamber, except at the doorway; and a number of
  kilns may be built in a row or group having their bottom flues connected
  with the same tall chimney. Down-draught kilns usually give a more
  regular fire and a higher percentage of well-fired bricks; and they are
  more economical in fuel consumption than up-draught kilns, while the hot
  gases, as they pass from the kiln, may be utilized for drying purposes,
  being conducted through flues under the floor of the drying-shed, on
  their way to the chimney. The method of using one tall chimney to work a
  group of down-draught kilns naturally led to the invention of the
  "continuous" kiln, which is really made up of a number of separate kilns
  or firing-chambers, built in series and connected up to the main flue of
  the chimney in such a manner that the products of combustion from one
  kiln may be made to pass through a number of other kilns before entering
  the flue. The earliest form of continuous kiln was invented by Friedrich
  Hoffman, and all kilns of this type are built on the Hoffman principle,
  although there are a great number of modifications of the original
  Hoffman construction. The great principle of "continuous" firing is the
  utilization of the waste heat from one kiln or section of a kiln in
  heating up another kiln or section, direct firing being applied only to
  finish the burning. In practice a number of kilns or firing-chambers,
  usually rectangular in plan, are built side by side in two parallel
  lines, which are connected at the ends by other kilns so as to make a
  complete circuit. The original form of the complete series was elliptical
  in plan, but the tendency in recent years has been to flatten the sides
  of the ellipse and bring them together, thus giving two parallel rows
  joined at the ends by a chamber or passage at right angles. Coal or gas
  is burnt in the chamber or section that is being fired-up, the air
  necessary for the combustion being heated on its passage through the
  kilns that are cooling down, and the products of combustion, before
  entering the chimney flue, are drawn through a number of other kilns or
  chambers containing unfired bricks, which are thus gradually heated up by
  the otherwise waste-heat from the sections being fired. Continuous kilns
  produce a more evenly fired product than the intermittent kilns usually
  do, and, of course, at much less cost for fuel. Gas firing is now being
  extensively applied to continuous kilns, natural gas in some instances
  being used in the United States of America; and the methods of
  construction and of firing are carried out with greater care and
  intelligence, the prime objects being economy of fuel and perfect control
  of firing. Pyrometers are coming into use for the control of the firing
  temperature, with the result that a constant and trustworthy product is
  turned put. The introduction of machinery greatly helped the brickmaking
  industry in opening up new sources of supply of raw material in the
  shales and hardened clays of the sedimentary deposits of the older
  geologic formations, and, with the extended use of continuous firing
  plants, it has led to the establishment of large concerns where
  everything is co-ordinated for the production of enormous quantities of
  bricks at a minimum cost. In the United Kingdom, and still more in
  Germany and the United States of America, great improvements have been
  made in machinery, firing-plant and organization, so that the whole
  manufacture is now being conducted on more scientific lines, to the great
  advantage of the industry.</p>

  <p><i>Blue Brick</i> is a very strong vitreous brick of dark, slaty-blue
  colour, used in engineering works where great strength or impermeability
  is desirable. These bricks are made of clay containing front 7 to 10% of
  oxide of iron, and their manufacture is carried out in the ordinary way
  until the later stages of the firing process, when they are subjected to
  the strongly reducing action of a smoky atmosphere, which is produced by
  throwing small bituminous coal upon the fire-mouths and damping down the
  admission of air. The smoke thus produced reduces the red ferric oxide to
  blue-green ferrous oxide, or to metallic iron, which combines with the
  silica present to form a fusible ferrous silicate. This fusible "slag"
  partly combines with the other silicates present, and partly fills up the
  pores, and so produces a vitreous impermeable layer varying in thickness
  according to the duration and character of the smoking, the finishing
  temperature of the kiln and the texture of the brick. Particles of carbon
  penetrate the surface during the early stages of the smoking, and a small
  quantity of carbon probably enters into combination, tending to produce a
  harder surface and darker colour.</p>

  <p><i>Floating Bricks</i> were first mentioned by Strabo, the Greek
  geographer, and afterwards by Pliny as being made at Pitane in the Troad.
  The secret of their manufacture was lost for many centuries, but was
  rediscovered in 1791 by Fabroni, an Italian, who made them from the
  fossil meal (diatomaceous earth) found in Tuscany. These bricks are very
  light, fairly strong, and being poor conductors of heat, have been
  employed for the construction of powder-magazines on board ship,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Mortar Bricks</i> belong to the class of unburnt bricks, and are,
  strictly speaking, blocks of artificial stone made in brick moulds. These
  bricks have been made for many years by moulding a mixture of sand and
  slaked lime and allowing the blocks thus made to harden in the air. This
  hardening is brought about partly by evaporation of the water, but
  chiefly by the conversion of the calcium hydrate, or slaked lime, into
  calcium carbonate by the action of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere. A
  small proportion of the lime enters into combination with the silica and
  water present to form hydrated calcium silicate, and probably a little
  hydrated basic carbonate of lime is also formed, both of which substances
  are in the nature of cement. This process of natural hardening by
  exposure to the air was a very long one, occupying from six to eighteen
  months, and many improvements were introduced during the latter half of
  the 19th century to improve the strength of the bricks and to hasten the
  hardening. <!-- Page 521 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page521"></a>[v.04 p.0521]</span>Mixtures of sand, lime and cement
  (and of certain ground blast-furnace slags and lime) were introduced; the
  moulding was done under hydraulic presses and the bricks afterwards
  treated with carbon dioxide under pressure, with or without the
  application of mild heat. Some of these mixtures and methods are still in
  use, but a new type of mortar brick has come into use during recent years
  which has practically superseded the old mortar brick.</p>

  <p><i>Sand-lime Bricks</i>.&mdash;In the early 'eighties of the 19th
  century, Dr Michaelis of Berlin patented a new process for hardening
  blocks made of a mixture of sand and lime by treating them with
  high-pressure steam for a few hours, and the so-called <i>sand-lime</i>
  bricks are now made on a very extensive scale in many countries. There
  are many differences of detail in the manufacture, but the general method
  is in all cases the same. Dry sand is intimately mixed with about
  one-tenth of its weight of powdered slaked lime, the mixture is then
  slightly moistened with water and afterwards moulded into bricks under
  powerful presses, capable of exerting a pressure of about 60 tons per sq.
  in. After removal from the press the bricks are immediately placed in
  huge steel cylinders usually 60 to 80 ft. long and about 7 ft. in
  diameter, and are there subjected to the action of high-pressure steam
  (120 lb to 150 lb per sq. in.) for from ten to fifteen hours. The
  proportion of slaked lime to sand varies according to the nature of the
  lime and the purity and character of the sand, one of lime to ten of sand
  being a fair average. The following is an analysis of a typical German
  sand-lime brick: silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), 84%; lime (CaO), 7%; alumina
  and oxide of iron, 2%; water, magnesia and alkalis, 7%. Under the action
  of the high-pressure steam the lime attacks the particles of sand, and a
  chemical compound of water, lime and silica is produced which forms a
  strong bond between the larger particles of sand. This bond of hydrated
  calcium silicate is evidently different from, and of better type than,
  the filling of calcium carbonate produced in the mortar-brick, and the
  sand-lime brick is consequently much stronger than the ordinary
  mortar-brick, however the latter may be made. The sand-lime brick is
  simple in manufacture, and with reasonable care is of constant quality.
  It is usually of a light-grey colour, but may be stained by the addition
  of suitable colouring oxides or pigments unaffected by lime and the
  conditions of manufacture.</p>

  <p><a name="Footnote_051" href="#FnAnchor_051">[1]</a> The term "marl"

  <p><b>BRICKFIELDER,</b> a term used in Australia for a hot scorching wind
  blowing from the interior, where the sandy wastes, bare of vegetation in
  summer, are intensely heated by the sun. This hot wind blows strongly,
  often for several days at a time, defying all attempts to keep the dust
  down, and parching all vegetation. It is in one sense a healthy wind, as,
  being exceedingly dry and hot, it destroys many injurious germs of
  disease. The northern brickfielder is almost invariably followed by a
  strong "southerly buster," cloudy and cool from the ocean. The two winds
  are due to the same cause, viz. a cyclonic system over the Australian
  Bight. These systems frequently extend inland as a narrow V-shaped
  depression (the apex northward), bringing the winds from the north on
  their eastern sides and from the south on their western. Hence as the
  narrow system passes eastward the wind suddenly changes from north to
  south, and the thermometer has been known to fall fifteen degrees in
  twenty minutes.</p>

  <p><b>BRICKWORK,</b> in building, the term applied to constructions made
  of bricks. The tools and implements employed by the bricklayer
  are:&mdash;the trowel for spreading the mortar; the plumb-rule to keep
  the work perpendicular, or in the case of an inclined or battering wall,
  to a regular batter, for the plumb-rule may be made to suit any required
  inclination; the spirit-level to keep the work horizontal, often used in
  conjunction with a straight-edge in order to test a greater length; and
  the gauge-rod with the brick-courses marked on it. The quoins or angles
  are first built up with the aid of the gauge-rod, and the intermediate
  work is kept regular by means of the line and line pins fixed in the
  joints. The raker, jointer, pointing rule and Frenchman are used in
  pointing joints, the pointing staff being held on a small board called
  the hawk. For roughly cutting bricks the large trowel is used; for neater
  work such as facings, the bolster and club-hammer; the cold chisel is for
  general cutting away, and for chases and holes. When bricks require to be
  cut, the work is set out with the square, bevel and compasses. If the
  brick to be shaped is a hard one it is placed on a V-shaped cutting
  block, an incision made where desired with the tin saw, and after the
  bolster and club-hammer have removed the portion of the brick, the
  scutch, really a small axe, is used to hack off the rough parts. For
  cutting soft bricks, such as rubbers and malms, a frame saw with a blade
  of soft iron wire is used, and the face is brought to a true surface on
  the rubbing stone, a slab of Yorkshire stone.</p>

  <p>In ordinary practice a scaffold is carried up with the walls and made
  to rest on them. Having built up as high as he can reach from the ground,
  the scaffolder erects a scaffold with standards, ledgers and putlogs to
  carry the scaffold boards (see <span class="sc">Scaffold</span>, <span
  class="sc">Scaffolding</span>). Bricks are carried to the scaffold on a
  hod which holds twenty bricks, or they may be hoisted in baskets or boxes
  by means of a pulley and fall, or may be raised in larger numbers by a
  crane. The mortar is taken up in a hod or hoisted in pails and deposited
  on ledged boards about 3 ft. square, placed on the scaffold at convenient
  distances apart along the line of work. The bricks are piled on the
  scaffold between the mortar boards, leaving a clear way against the wall
  for the bricklayers to move along. The workman, beginning at the extreme
  left of his section, or at a quoin, advances to the right, carefully
  keeping to his line and frequently testing his work with the plumb-rule,
  spirit-level and straight-edge, until he reaches another angle, or the
  end of his section. The pointing is sometimes finished off as the work
  proceeds, but in other cases the joints are left open until the
  completion, when the work is pointed down, perhaps in a different mortar.
  When the wall has reached a height from the scaffold beyond which the
  workman cannot conveniently reach, the scaffolding is raised and the work
  continued in this manner from the new level.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/brickwork_1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/brickwork_1.png"
      alt="Brickwork, Fig. 1." title="Brickwork, Fig. 1." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.
  </div>
  <p>It is most important that the brickwork be kept perfectly plumb, and
  that every course be perfectly horizontal or level, both longitudinally
  and transversely. Strictest attention should be paid to the levelling of
  the lowest course of footings of a wall, for any irregularity will
  necessitate the inequality being made up with mortar in the courses
  above, thus inducing a liability for the wall to settle unequally, and so
  perpetuate the infirmity. To save the trouble of keeping the plumb-rule
  and level constantly in his hands and yet ensure correct work, the
  bricklayer, on clearing the footings of a wall, builds up six or eight
  courses of bricks at the external angles (see fig. 1), which he carefully
  plumbs and levels across. These form a gauge for the intervening work, a
  line being tightly strained between and fixed with steel pins to each
  angle at a level with the top of the next course to be laid, and with
  this he makes his work range. If, however, the length between the quoins
  be great, the line will of course sag, and it must, therefore, be
  carefully supported at intervals to the proper level. Care must be taken
  to keep the "perpends," or vertical joints, one immediately over the
  other. Having been carried up three or four courses to a level with the
  guidance of the line which is raised course by course, the work should be
  proved with the level and plumb-rule, particularly with the latter at the
  quoins and reveals, as well as over the face. A smart tap with the end of
  the handle of the trowel will suffice to make a brick yield what little
  it may be out of truth, while the work is green, and not injure it. The
  work of an efficient craftsman, however, will need but little
  adjustment.</p>

  <p>For every wall of more than one brick (9 in) thick, two men should be
  employed at the same time, one on the outside and the <!-- Page 522
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page522"></a>[v.04 p.0522]</span>other
  inside; one man cannot do justice from one side to even a 14-in. wall.
  When the wall can be approached from one side only, the work is said to
  be executed "overhand." In work circular on plan, besides the level and
  plumb-rule, a gauge mould or template, or a ranging trammel&mdash;a rod
  working on a pivot at the centre of the curve, and in length equalling
  the radius&mdash;must be used for every course, as it is evident that the
  line and pins cannot be applied to this in the manner just described.</p>

  <p>Bricks should not be merely <i>laid</i>, but each should be placed
  frog upwards, and rubbed and pressed firmly down in such a manner as to
  secure absolute adhesion, and force the mortar into joints. Every brick
  should be well wetted before it is laid, especially in hot dry weather,
  in order to wash off the dust from its surface, and to obtain more
  complete adhesion, and prevent it from absorbing water from the mortar in
  which it is bedded. The bricks are wetted either by the bricklayer
  dipping them in water as he uses them, or by water being thrown or
  sprinkled on them as they lie piled on the scaffold. In bricklaying with
  quick-setting cements an ample use of water is of even more
  importance.</p>

  <p>All the walls of a building that are to sustain the same floors and
  the same roof, should be carried up simultaneously; in no circumstances
  should more be done in one part than can be reached from the same
  scaffold, until all the walls are brought up to the same height. Where it
  is necessary for any reason to leave a portion of the wall at a certain
  level while carrying up the adjoining work the latter should be racked
  back, i.e. left in steps as shown in fig. 7, and not carried up
  vertically with merely the toothing necessary for the bond.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Section of a Hollow Wall.
  </div>
  <p>Buildings in exposed situations are frequently built with
  cavity-walls, consisting of the inside or main walls with an outer skin
  <span class="sidenote">Hollow walls.</span> usually half a brick thick,
  separated from the former by a cavity of 2 or 3 in. (fig. 2). The two
  walls are tied together at frequent intervals by iron or stoneware ties,
  each having a bend or twist in the centre, which prevents the
  transmission of water to the inner wall. All water, therefore, which
  penetrates the outer wall drops to the base of the cavity, and trickles
  out through gratings provided for the purpose a few inches above the
  ground level. The base of the cavity should be taken down a course or two
  below the level of the damp-proof course. The ties are placed about 3 ft.
  apart horizontally, with 12 or 18 in. vertical intervals; they are about
  8 in. long and ¾ in. wide. It is considered preferable by some architects
  and builders to place the thicker wall on the outside. This course,
  however, allows the main wall to be attacked by the weather, whereas the
  former method provides for its protection by a screen of brickwork. Where
  door and window frames occur in hollow walls, it is of the utmost
  importance that a proper lead or other flashing be built in, shaped so as
  to throw off on each side, clear of the frames and main wall, the water
  which may penetrate the outer shell. While building the wall it is very
  essential to ensure that the cavity and ties be kept clean and free from
  rubbish or mortar, and for this purpose a wisp of straw or a narrow
  board, is laid on the ties where the bricklayer is working, to catch any
  material that may be inadvertently dropped, this protection being raised
  as the work proceeds. A hollow wall tends to keep the building dry
  internally and the temperature equable, but it has the disadvantage of
  harbouring vermin, unless care be taken to ensure their exclusion. The
  top of the wall is usually sealed with brickwork to prevent vermin or
  rubbish finding its way into the cavity. Air gratings should be
  introduced here to allow of air circulating through the cavity; they also
  facilitate drying out after rain.</p>

  <p>Hollow walls are not much used in London for two reasons, the first
  being that, owing to the protection from the weather afforded by
  surrounding buildings, one of the main reasons for their use is gone, and
  the other that the expense is greatly increased, owing to the authorities
  ignoring the outer shell and requiring the main wall to be of the full
  thickness stipulated in schedule I. of London Building Act 1894. Many
  English provincial authorities in determining the thickness of a
  cavity-wall, take the outer portion into consideration.</p>

  <p>In London and the surrounding counties, brickwork is measured by the
  <i>rod</i> of 16½ ft. square, 1½ bricks in thickness. A rod of brickwork
  <span class="sidenote">Materials and labour.</span> gauged four courses
  to a foot with bricks 8¾ in. long, 4¼ in. wide, and 2¾ in thick, and
  joints ¼ in. in thickness, will require 4356 bricks, and the number will
  vary as the bricks are above or below the average size, and as the joints
  are made thinner or thicker. The quantity of mortar, also, will evidently
  be affected by the latter consideration, but in London it is generally
  reckoned at 50 cub. ft. for a ¼-in. joint, to 72 cub. ft. for a joint
  &#x215C; in. thick. To these figures must be added an allowance of about
  11 cub. ft. if the bricks are formed with frogs or hollows. Bricks weigh
  about 7 lb each; they are bought and sold by the thousand, which quantity
  weighs about 62 cwt. The weight of a rod of brickwork is 13½-15 tons,
  work in cement mortar being heavier than that executed in lime. Seven
  bricks are required to face a sq. ft.; 1 ft. of reduced
  brickwork&mdash;1½ bricks thick&mdash;will require 16 bricks. The number
  of bricks laid by a workman in a day of eight hours varies considerably
  with the description of work, but on straight walling a man will lay an
  average of 500 in a day.</p>

  <p>The absorbent properties of bricks vary considerably with the kind of
  brick. The ordinary London stock of good quality should <span
  class="sidenote">Varieties of bricks.</span> not have absorbed, after
  twenty-four hours' soaking, more than one-fifth of its bulk. Inferior
  bricks will absorb as much as a third. The Romans were great users of
  bricks, both burnt and sun-dried. At the decline of the Roman empire, the
  art of brickmaking fell into disuse, but after the lapse of some
  centuries it was revived, and the ancient architecture of Italy shows
  many fine examples of brick and terra-cotta work. The scarcity of stone
  in the Netherlands led to the development of a brick architecture, and
  fine examples of brickwork abound in the Low Countries. The Romans seem
  to have introduced brickmaking into England, and specimens of the large
  thin bricks, which they used chiefly as a bond for rubble masonry, may be
  seen in the many remains of Roman buildings scattered about that country.
  During the reigns of the early Tudor kings the art of brickmaking arrived
  at great perfection, and some of the finest known specimens of ornamental
  brickwork are to be found among the work of this period. The rebuilding
  of London after the Great Fire of 1666 gave considerable impetus to
  brickmaking, most of the new buildings being of brick, and a statute was
  passed regulating the number of bricks in the thickness of the walls of
  the several rates of dwelling-houses.</p>

  <p>The many names given to the different qualities of bricks in various
  parts of Great Britain are most confusing, but the following are those
  generally in use:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Stocks</i>, hard, sound, well-burnt bricks, used for all ordinary
  purposes.</p>

  <p><i>Hard Stocks,</i> sound but over-burnt, used in footings to walls
  and other positions where good appearance is not required.</p>

  <p><i>Shippers</i>, sound, hard-burnt bricks of imperfect shape. Obtain
  their name from being much used as ballast for ships.</p>

  <p><i>Rubbers</i> or <i>Cutters</i>, sandy in composition and suitable
  for cutting with a wire saw and rubbing to shape on the stone slab.</p>

  <p><i>Grizzles</i>, sound and of fair shape, but under-burnt; used for
  inferior work, and in cases where they are not liable to be heavily
  loaded.</p>

  <p><i>Place-bricks</i>, under-burnt and defective; used for temporary
  work.</p>

  <p><i>Chuffs</i>, cracked and defective in shape and badly burnt. <!--
  Page 523 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page523"></a>[v.04
  p.0523]</span><i>Burrs</i>, lumps which have vitrified or run together in
  the burning; used for rough walling, garden work, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Pressed bricks</i>, moulded under hydraulic pressure, and much used
  for facing work. They usually have a deep frog or hollow on one or both
  horizontal faces, which reduces the weight of the brick and forms an
  excellent key for the mortar.</p>

  <p><i>Blue bricks</i>, chiefly made in South Staffordshire and North
  Wales. They are used in engineering work, and where great compressional
  resistance is needed, as they are vitrified throughout, hard, heavy,
  impervious and very durable. Blue bricks of special shape may be had for
  paving, channelling and coping.</p>

  <p><i>Fire-bricks</i>, withstanding great heat, used in connexion with
  furnaces. They should always be laid with fire-clay in place of lime or
  cement mortar.</p>

  <p><i>Glazed bricks</i>, either salt-glazed or enamelled. The former,
  brown in colour, are glazed by throwing salt on the bricks in the kiln.
  The latter are dipped into a slip of the required colour before being
  burnt, and are used for decorative and sanitary purposes, and where
  reflected light is required.</p>

  <p><i>Moulded bricks</i>, for cornices, string courses, plinths, labels
  and copings. They are made in the different classes to many patterns; and
  on account of their greater durability, and the saving of the labour of
  cutting, are preferable in many cases to rubbers. For sewer work and
  arches, bricks shaped as voussoirs are supplied.</p>

  <p>The strength of brickwork varies very considerably according to the
  kind of brick used, the position in which it is used, the kind and <span
  class="sidenote">Strength of brickwork.</span> quality of the lime or
  cement mortar, and above all the quality of the workmanship. The results
  of experiments with short walls carried out in 1896-1897 by the Royal
  Institute of British Architects to determine the average loads per sq.
  ft. at which crushing took place, may be briefly summarized as follows:
  Stock brickwork in lime mortar crushed under a pressure of 18.63 tons per
  sq. ft., and in cement mortar under 39.29 tons per sq. ft. Gault
  brickwork in lime mortar crushed at 31.14 tons, and in cement mortar at
  51.34 tons. Fletton brickwork in lime crushed under a load of 30.68 tons,
  in cement under 56.25 tons. Leicester red brickwork in lime mortar
  crushed at 45.36 tons per sq. ft., in cement mortar at 83.36 tons.
  Staffordshire blue brick work in lime mortar crushed at 114.34 tons, and
  in cement mortar at 135.43 tons.</p>

  <p>The height of a brick pier should not exceed twelve times its least
  width. The London Building Act in the first schedule prescribes that in
  buildings not public, or of the warehouse class, in no storey shall any
  external or party walls exceed in height sixteen times the thickness. In
  buildings of the warehouse class, the height of these walls shall not
  exceed fourteen times the thickness.</p>

  <p>In exposed situations it is necessary to strengthen the buildings by
  increasing the thickness of walls and parapets, and to provide heavier
  copings and flashings. Special precautions, too, must be observed in the
  fixing of copings, chimney pots, ridges and hips. The greatest wind
  pressure experienced in England may be taken at 56 lb on a sq. ft., but
  this is only in the most exposed positions in the country or on a sea
  front. Forty pounds is a sufficient allowance in most cases, and where
  there is protection by surrounding trees or buildings 28 lb per sq. ft.
  is all that needs to be provided against.</p>

  <p>In mixing mortar, particular attention must be paid to the sand with
  which the lime or cement is mixed. The best sand is that <span
  class="sidenote">Mortar.</span> obtained from the pit, being sharp and
  angular. It is, however, liable to be mixed with clay or earth, which
  must be washed away before the sand is used. Gravel found mixed with it
  must be removed by screening or sifting. River sand is frequently used,
  but is not so good as pit sand on account of the particles being rubbed
  smooth by attrition. Sea sand is objectionable for two reasons; it cannot
  be altogether freed from a saline taint, and if it is used the salt
  attracts moisture and is liable to keep the brickwork permanently damp.
  The particles, moreover, are generally rounded by attrition, caused by
  the movement of the sea, which makes it less efficient for mortar than if
  they retained their original angular forms. Blue or black mortar, often
  used for pointing the joints of external brickwork on account of its
  greater durability, is made by using foundry sand or smith's ashes
  instead of ordinary sand. There are many other substitutes for the
  ordinary sand. As an example, fine stone grit may be used with advantage.
  Thoroughly burnt clay or ballast, old bricks, clinkers and cinders,
  ground to a uniform size and screened from dust, also make excellent
  substitutes.</p>

  <p>Fat limes (that is, limes which are pure, as opposed to "hydraulic"
  limes which are burnt from limestone containing some clay) should not be
  used for mortar; they are slow-setting, and there is a liability for some
  of the mortar, where there is not a free access of air to assist the
  setting, remaining soft for some considerable period, often months, thus
  causing unequal settlement and possibly failure. Grey stone lime is
  feebly hydraulic, and makes a good mortar for ordinary work. It, however,
  decays under the influence of the weather, and it is, therefore,
  advisable to point the external face of the work in blue ash or cement
  mortar, in order to obtain greater durability. It should never be used in
  foundation work, or where exposed to wet. Lias lime is hydraulic, that
  is, it will set firm under water. It should be used in all good class
  work, where Portland cement is not desired.</p>

  <p>Of the various cements used in building, it is necessary only to
  mention three as being applicable to use for mortar. The first of these
  is Portland cement, which has sprung into very general use, not only for
  work where extra strength and durability are required, and for
  underground work, but also in general building where a small extra cost
  is not objected to. Ordinary lime mortar may have its strength
  considerably enhanced by the addition of a small proportion of Portland
  cement. Roman cement is rarely used for mortar, but is useful in some
  cases on account of the rapidity with which it sets, usually becoming
  hard about fifteen minutes after mixing. It is useful in tidal work and
  embankments, and constructions under water. It has about one-third of the
  strength of Portland cement, by which it is now almost entirely
  supplanted. Selenitic cement or lime, invented by Major-General H. Y. D.
  Scott (1822-1883), is lias lime, to which a small proportion of plaster
  of Paris has been added with the object of suppressing the action of
  slaking and inducing quicker setting. If carefully mixed in accordance
  with the instructions issued by the manufacturers, it will take a much
  larger proportion of sand than ordinary lime.</p>

  <p>Lime should be slaked before being made into mortar. The lime is
  measured out, deposited in a heap on a wooden "bank" or platform, and
  after being well watered is covered with the correct proportion of sand.
  This retains the heat and moisture necessary to thorough slaking; the
  time required for this operation depends on the variety of the lime, but
  usually it is from a few hours to one and a half days. If the mixing is
  to be done by hand the materials must be screened to remove any unslaked
  lumps of lime. The occurrence of these may be prevented by grinding the
  lime shortly before use. The mass should then be well "larried,"
  <i>i.e.</i> mixed together with the aid of a long-handled rake called the
  "larry." Lime mortar should be tempered for at least two days, roughly
  covered up with sacks or other material. Before being used it must be
  again turned over and well mixed together. Portland and Roman cement
  mortars must be mixed as required on account of their quick-setting
  properties. In the case of Portland cement mortar, a quantity sufficient
  only for the day's use should be "knocked up," but with Roman cement
  fresh mixtures must be made several times a day, as near as possible to
  the place of using. Cement mortars should never be worked up after
  setting has taken place. Care should be taken to obtain the proper
  consistency, which is a stiff paste. If the mortar be too thick, extra
  labour is involved in its use, and much time wasted. If it be so thin as
  to run easily from the trowel, a longer time is taken in setting, and the
  wall is liable to settle; also there is danger that the lime or cement
  will be killed by the excess of water, or at least have its binding power
  affected. It is not advisable to carry out work when the temperature is
  below freezing point, but in urgent cases bricklaying may be successfully
  done by using unslaked lime mortar. The mortar must be prepared in small
  quantities immediately before being used, so that binding action takes
  place before it cools. When the wall is left at night time the top course
  should be covered up to prevent the penetration of rain into the work,
  which would then be destroyed by the action of frost. Bricks used during
  frosty weather should be quite dry, and those that have been exposed to
  rain or frost should never be employed. The question whether there is any
  limit to bricklayers' work in frost is still an open one. Among the
  members of the Norwegian Society of Engineers and Architects, at whose
  meetings the subject has been frequently discussed, that limit is
  variously estimated at between -6° to -8° Réaumur (18½° to 14° Fahr.) and
  -12° to -15° Réaumur (5° above to 1¾° below zero Fahr.). It has been
  proved by hydraulic tests that good bricklayers' work can be executed at
  the latter minimum. The conviction is held that the variations in the
  opinions held on this subject are attributable to the degree of care
  bestowed on the preparation of the mortar. It is generally agreed,
  however, that from a practical point of view, bricklaying should not be
  carried on at temperatures lower than -8° to -10° Réaumur (14° to 9½°
  Fahr.), for as the thermometer falls the expense of building is greatly
  increased, owing to a larger proportion of lime being required.</p>

  <p>For grey lime mortar the usual proportion is one part of lime to two
  or three parts of sand; lias lime mortar is mixed in similar proportions,
  except for work below ground, when equal quantities of lime and sand
  should be used. Portland cement mortar is usually in the proportions of
  one to three, or five, of sand; good results are obtained with lime
  mortar fortified with cement as follows:&mdash;one part slaked lime, one
  part Portland cement, and seven parts sand. Roman cement mortar should
  consist of one or one and a half parts of cement to one part of sand.
  Selenitic lime mortar is usually in the proportions of one to four or
  five, and must be mixed in a particular manner, the lime being first
  ground in water in the mortar mill, and the sand gradually added. Blue or
  black mortar contains equal parts of foundry ashes and lime; but is
  improved by the addition of a proportion of cement. For setting
  fire-bricks fire-clay is always used. Pargetting for rendering inside
  chimney flues is made of one part of lime with three parts of cow dung
  free from straw or litter. No efficient substitute has been found for
  this mixture, which should be used fresh. A mortar that has found
  approval for tall chimney shafts is composed by grinding in a mortar-mill
  one part of blue lias lime with one part each of sand and foundry ashes.
  In the external walls of the Albert Hall the mortar used was one part
  Portland cement, one part grey Burham lime and six parts pit sand. The
  lime was slaked twenty-four hours, and after being mixed <!-- Page 524
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page524"></a>[v.04 p.0524]</span>with
  the sand for ten minutes the cement was added and the whole ground for
  one minute; the stuff was prepared in quantities only sufficient for
  immediate use. The by-laws dated 1891, made by the London County Council
  under section 16 of the Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment
  Act 1878, require the proportions of lime mortar to be one to three of
  sand or grit, and for cement mortar one to four. Clean soft water only
  should be used for the purpose of making mortar.</p>

  <p><i>Grout</i> is thin liquid mortar, and is legitimately used in gauged
  arches and other work when fine joints are desired. In ordinary work it
  is sometimes used every four or five courses to fill up any spaces that
  may have been inadvertently left between the bricks. This at the best is
  but doing with grout what should be done with mortar in the operation of
  laying the bricks; and filling or flushing up every course with mortar
  requires but little additional exertion and is far preferable. The use of
  grout is, therefore, a sign of inefficient workmanship, and should not be
  countenanced in good work. It is liable, moreover, to ooze out and stain
  the face of the brickwork.</p>

  <p><i>Lime putty</i> is pure slaked lime. It is prepared or "run," as it
  is termed, in a wooden tub or bin, and should be made as long a time as
  possible before being used; at least three weeks should elapse between
  preparation and use.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Forms of Joints.
  </div>
  <p>The pointing of a wall, as previously mentioned, is done either with
  the bricklaying or at the completion of the work. If the <span
  class="sidenote">Pointing.</span> pointing is to be of the same mortar as
  the rest of the work, it would probably greatly facilitate matters to
  finish off the work at one operation with the bricklaying, but where, as
  in many cases, the pointing is required to be executed in a more durable
  mortar, this would be done as the scaffold is taken down at the
  completion of the building, the joints being raked out by the bricklayer
  to a depth of ½ or ¾ in. By the latter method the whole face of the work
  is kept uniform in appearance. The different forms of joints in general
  use are clearly shown in fig. 3. Flat or flush joints (A) are formed by
  pressing the protruding mortar back flush with the face of the brickwork.
  This joint is commonly used for walls intended to be coated with
  distemper or limewhite. The flat joint jointed (two forms, B and C) is a
  development of the flush joint. In order to increase the density and
  thereby enhance the durability of the mortar, a semicircular groove is
  formed along the centre, or one on each side of the joint, with an iron
  jointer and straight-edge. Another form, rarely used, is the keyed joint
  shown at D, the whole width of the joint in this case being treated with
  the curved key. Struck or bevelled, or weathered, joints have the upper
  portion pressed back with the trowel to form a sloping surface, which
  throws off the wet. The lower edge is cut off with the trowel to a
  straight edge. This joint is in very common use for new work. Ignorant
  workmen frequently make the slope in the opposite direction (F), thus
  forming a ledge on the brick; this catches the water, which on being
  frozen rapidly causes the disintegration of the upper portion of the
  brick and of the joint itself. With recessed jointing, not much used, a
  deep shadow may be obtained. This form of joint, illustrated in G, is
  open to very serious objections, for it encourages the soaking of the
  brick with rain instead of throwing off the wet, as it seems the natural
  function of good pointing, and this, besides causing undue dampness in
  the wall, renders it liable to damage by frost. It also leaves the
  arrises of the bricks unprotected and liable to be damaged, and from its
  deep recessed form does not make for stability in the work. Gauged work
  has very thin joints, as shown at H, formed by dipping the side of the
  brick in white lime putty. The sketch I shows a joint raked out and
  filled in with pointing mortar to form a flush joint, or it may be
  finished in any of the preceding forms. Where the wall is to be plastered
  the joints are either left open or raked out, or the superfluous mortar
  may be left protruding as shown at J. By either method an excellent key
  is obtained, to which the rendering firmly adheres. In tuck pointing (K)
  the joints are raked out and stopped, i.e. filled in flush with mortar
  coloured to match the brickwork. The face of the wall is then rubbed over
  with a soft brick of the same colour, or the work may be coloured with
  pigment. A narrow groove is then cut in the joints, and the mortar
  allowed to set. White lime putty is next filled into the groove, being
  pressed on with a jointing tool, leaving a white joint &#x215B; to ¼ in.
  wide, and with a projection of about 1/16 in. beyond the face of the
  work. This method is not a good or a durable one, and should only be
  adopted in old work when the edges of the bricks are broken or irregular.
  In bastard tuck pointing (L), the ridge, instead of being in white lime
  putty, is formed of the stopping mortar itself.</p>

  <p>Footings, as will be seen on reference to fig. 1, are the wide courses
  of brickwork at the base or foot of a wall. They serve to spread <span
  class="sidenote">Footings.</span> the pressure over a larger area of
  ground, offsets 2¼ in. wide being made on each side of the wall until a
  width equal to double the thickness of the wall is reached. Thus in a
  wall 13½ in. (1½ bricks) thick, this bottom course would be 2 ft. 3 in.
  (3 bricks) wide. It is preferable for greater strength to double the
  lowest course. The foundation bed of concrete then spreading out an
  additional 6 in. on each side brings the width of the surface bearing on
  the ground to 3 ft. 3 in. The London Building Act requires the projection
  of concrete on each side of the brickwork to be only 4 in., but a
  projection of 6 in. is generally made to allow for easy working. Footings
  should be built with hard bricks laid principally as headers; stretchers,
  if necessary, should be placed in the middle of the wall.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Diagram of Bonding.
  </div>
  <p>Bond in brickwork is the arrangement by which the bricks of every
  course cover the joints of those in the course below it, and so <span
  class="sidenote">Bonding.</span> tend to make the whole mass or
  combination of bricks act as much together, or as dependently one upon
  another, as possible. The workmen should be strictly supervised as they
  proceed with the work, for many failures are due to their ignorance or
  carelessness in this particular. The object of bonding will be understood
  by reference to fig. 4. Here it is evident from the arrangement of the
  bricks that any weight placed on the topmost brick (<i>a</i>) is carried
  down and borne alike in every course; in this way the weight on each
  brick is distributed over an area increasing with every course. But this
  forms a longitudinal bond only, which cannot extend its influence beyond
  the width of the brick; and a wall of one brick and a half, or two
  bricks, thick, built in this manner, would in effect consist of three or
  four half brick thick walls acting independently of each other. If the
  bricks were turned so as to show their short sides or ends in front
  instead of their long ones, certainly a compact wall of a whole brick
  thick, instead of half a brick, would be produced, and while the
  thickness of the wall would be double, the longitudinal bond would be
  shortened by one-half: a wall of any great thickness built in this manner
  would necessarily be composed of so many independent one-brick walls. To
  produce a transverse and yet preserve a true longitudinal bond, the
  bricks are laid in a definite arrangement of stretchers and headers.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;English Bond.

    <p class="poem">In this and following illustration of bond in brickwork
    the position of bricks in the second course is indicated by dotted
    lines.</p>
  </div>
  <p>In "English bond" (fig. 5), rightly considered the most perfect in
  use, the bricks are laid in alternate courses of headers and stretchers,
  thus combining the advantages of the two previous modes of arrangement. A
  reference to fig. 5 will show how the process of bonding is pursued in a
  wall one and a half bricks in thickness, and how the quoins are formed.
  In walls which are a multiple of a whole brick, the appearance of the
  same course is similar on the elevations of the front and back faces, but
  in walls where an odd half brick must be used to make up the thickness,
  as is the case in the illustration, the appearance of the opposite sides
  of a course is inverted. The example illustrates the principle of English
  bond; thicker walls are constructed in the same manner by an extension of
  the same methods. It will be observed that portions of a brick have to be
  inserted near a vertical end or a quoin, in order to start the regular
  bond. These portions equal a half header in width, and are called queen
  closers; they are placed next to the first header. A three-quarter brick
  is obviously as available for this purpose as a header and closer
  combined, but the latter method is preferred because by the use of it
  uniformity of appearance is preserved, and whole bricks are retained on
  the returns. King closers are used at rebated openings formed in walls in
  Flemish bond, and by reason of the greater width of the back or "tail,"
  add strength to the work. They are cut on the splay so that the front end
  is half the width of a header and one side half the length of the brick.
  An example of their use will be seen in fig. 15. In walls of almost all
  thicknesses above 9 in., except in the <!-- Page 525 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page525"></a>[v.04 p.0525]</span>English bond,
  to preserve the transverse and yet not destroy the longitudinal bond, it
  is frequently necessary to use half bricks. It may be taken as a general
  rule that a brick should never be cut if it can be worked in whole, for a
  new joint is thereby created in a construction, the difficulty of which
  consists in obviating the debility arising from the constant recurrence
  of joints. Great insistence must be laid on this point, especially at the
  junctions of walls, where the admission of closers already constitutes a
  weakness which would only be increased by the use of other bats or
  fragments of bricks.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Flemish Bond.
  </div>
  <p>Another method of bonding brickwork, instead of placing the bricks in
  alternate courses of headers and stretchers, places them alternately as
  headers and stretchers in the same course, the appearance of the course
  being the same on each face. This is called "Flemish bond." Closers are
  necessary to this variety of bond. From fig. 6 it will be seen that,
  owing to the comparative weakness of the transverse tie, and the numbers
  of half bricks required to be used and the thereby increased number of
  joints, this bond is not so perfect nor so strong as English. The
  arrangements of the face joints, however, presenting in Flemish bond a
  neater appearance than in English bond, it is generally selected for the
  external walls of domestic and other buildings where good effect is
  desirable. In buildings erected for manufacturing and similar purposes,
  and in engineering works where the greatest degree of strength and
  compactness is considered of the highest importance, English bond should
  have the preference.</p>

  <p>A compromise is sometimes made between the two above-mentioned bonds.
  For the sake of appearance the bricks are laid to form Flemish bond on
  the face, while the backing is of English bond, the object being to
  combine the best features of the two bonds. Undoubtedly the result is an
  improvement on Flemish bond, obviating as it does the use of bats in the
  interior of the wall. This method of bonding is termed "single Flemish
  bond," and is shown in fig. 7.</p>

  <p>In stretching bond, which should only be used for walls half a brick
  in thickness, all the bricks are laid as stretchers, a half brick being
  used in alternate courses to start the bond. In work curved too sharply
  on plan to admit of the use of stretchers, and for footings, projecting
  mouldings and corbels, the bricks are all laid as headers, i.e. with
  their ends to the front, and their length across the thickness of the
  wall. This is termed "heading bond."</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;Single Flemish Bond.
  </div>
  <p>In thick walls, three bricks thick and upwards, a saving of labour is
  effected without loss of strength, by the adoption of "herring bone" or
  "diagonal bond" in the interior of the wall, the outer faces of the wall
  being built in English and Flemish bond. This mode should not be had
  recourse to for walls of a less thickness than 27 in., even that being
  almost too thin to admit of any great advantage from it.</p>

  <p>Hoop-iron, about 1½ in. wide and 1/16 in. thick, either galvanized or
  well tarred and sanded to retard rusting, is used in order to obtain
  additional longitudinal tie. The customary practice is to use one strip
  of iron for each half-brick in thickness of the wall. Joints at the
  angles, and where necessary in the length, are formed by bending the ends
  of the strips so as to hook together. A patent stabbed iron now on the
  market is perforated to provide a key for the mortar.</p>

  <p>A difficulty often arises in bonding when facing work with bricks of a
  slightly different size from those used in "backing," as it is
  technically termed. As it is, of course, necessary to keep all brickwork
  in properly levelled courses, a difference has to be made in the
  thickness of the mortar joints. Apart from the extra labour involved,
  this obviously is detrimental to the stability of the wall, and is apt to
  produce unequal settlement and cracking. Too much care cannot be taken to
  obtain both facing and backing bricks of equal size.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 8.
  </div>
  <p>Dishonest bricklayers do not hesitate, when using for the face of a
  wall bricks of a quality superior to those used for the interior, to use
  "snapped headers," that is cutting the heading bricks in halves, one
  brick thus serving the purposes of two as regards outward appearance.
  This is a most pernicious practice, unworthy of adoption by any craftsman
  of repute, for a skin of brickwork 4½ in. thick is thus carried up with a
  straight mortar joint behind it, the proper bonding with the back of the
  wall by means of headers being destroyed.</p>

  <p>American building acts describe the kind of bond to be used for
  ordinary walls, and the kind for faced walls. Tie courses also require an
  extra thickness where walls are perforated with over 30% of flues.</p>

  <p>The importance for sanitary and other reasons of keeping walls dry is
  admitted by all who have observed the deleterious action of damp upon a
  building.</p>

  <p>Walls are liable to become damp, (1) by wet rising up the wall from
  the earth; (2) by water soaking down from the top of the <span
  class="sidenote">Prevention of damp.</span> wall; (3) by rain being
  driven on to the face by wind. Dampness from the first cause may be
  prevented by the introduction of damp-proof courses or the construction
  of dry areas; from the second by means of a coping of stone, cement or
  other non-porous material; and from the third by covering the exterior
  with impervious materials or by the adoption of hollow walls.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 9.
  </div>
  <p>After the footings have been laid and the wall has been brought up to
  not less than 6 in. above the finished surface of the ground, and
  previous to fixing the plate carrying the ground floor, there should
  always be introduced a course of some damp-proof material to prevent the
  rise of moisture from the soil. There are several forms of damp-proof
  course. A very usual one is a double layer of roofing slates laid in neat
  Portland cement (fig. 8), the joints being well lapped. A course or two
  of Staffordshire blue bricks in cement is excellent where heavy weights
  have to be considered. Glazed stoneware perforated slabs about 2 in.
  thick are specially made for use as damp-proof courses. Asphalt (fig. 9)
  recently has come into great favour with architects; a layer ½ or ¾ in.
  thick is a good protection against damp, and not likely to crack should a
  settlement occur, but in hot weather it is liable to squeeze out at the
  joints under heavy weights. Felt covered with bitumen is an excellent
  substitute for asphalt, and is not liable to crack or squeeze out. Sheet
  lead is efficient, but very costly and also somewhat liable to squeezing.
  A damp-proof course has been introduced consisting of a thin sheet of
  lead sandwiched between layers of asphalt. Basement storeys to be kept
  dry require, besides the damp-proof course horizontally in the wall, a
  horizontal course, usually of asphalt, in the thickness of the floor, and
  also a vertical damp-proof course from a level below that of the floor to
  about 6 in. above the level of the ground, either built in the thickness
  of the wall or rendered on the outside between the wall and the
  surrounding earth (fig. 10).</p>

  <p>By means of dry areas or air drains (figs. 11 and 12), a hollow <!--
  Page 526 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page526"></a>[v.04
  p.0526]</span>space 9 in. or more in width is formed around those
  portions of the walls situated below the ground, the object being to
  prevent them from coming into contact with the brickwork of the main
  walls and so imparting its moisture to the building. Arrangements should
  be made for keeping the area clear of vermin and for ventilating and
  draining it. Dry areas, being far from sanitary, are seldom adopted now,
  and are being superseded by asphalt or cement applied to the face of the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Moisture is prevented from soaking down from the top of the wall by
  using a covering of some impervious material in the form of a coping.
  This may consist of ordinary bricks set on edge in cement with a double
  course of tiles immediately below, called a "creasing," or of specially
  made non-porous coping bricks, or of stone, cast-iron, or cement sloped
  or "weathered" in order to throw the rain off.</p>

  <p>The exterior of walls above the ground line may be protected by

  <p>The use of hollow walls in exposed positions has already been referred
  to.</p>

  <p>The by-laws dated 1891, made by the London County Council under
  section 16 of the Metropolis Management and Buildings Acts Amendment Act
  1878, require that "every wall of a house or building shall have a damp
  course composed of materials impervious to moisture approved by the
  district surveyor, extending throughout its whole thickness at the level
  of not less than 6 in. below the level of the lowest floor. Every
  external wall or enclosing wall of habitable rooms or their appurtenances
  or cellars which abuts against the earth shall be protected by materials
  impervious to moisture to the satisfaction of the district surveyor..."
  "The top of every party-wall and parapet-wall shall be finished with one
  course of hard, well-burnt bricks set on edge, in cement, or by a coping
  of any other waterproof and fire-resisting material, properly
  secured."</p>

  <p>Arches are constructions built of wedge-shaped blocks, which by reason
  of their shape give support one to another, and to the <span
  class="sidenote">Arches.</span> super-imposed weight, the resulting load
  being transmitted through the blocks to the abutments upon which the ends
  of the arch rest. An arch should be composed of such materials and
  designed of such dimensions as to enable it to retain its proper shape
  and resist the crushing strain imposed upon it. The abutments also must
  be strong enough to take safely the thrust of the weighted arch, as the
  slightest movement in these supports will cause deflection and failure.
  The outward thrust of an arch decreases as it approaches the semicircular
  form, but the somewhat prevalent idea that in the latter form no
  thrusting takes place is at variance with fact.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/brickwork_14.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/brickwork_14.png"
      alt="Fig. 14.--The shape of a voussoir, showing the use of lacing courses." title="Fig. 14.--The shape of a voussoir, showing the use of lacing courses." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 14.
  </div>
  <p>Arches in brickwork may be classed under three heads: plain arches,
  rough-cut and gauged. Plain arches are built of uncut bricks, and since
  the difference between the outer and inner periphery of the arch requires
  the parts of which an arch is made up to be wedge-formed, which an
  ordinary brick is not, the difference must be made in mortar, with the
  result that the joints become wedge-shaped. This obviously gives an
  objectionable inconsistency of material in the arch, and for this reason
  to obtain greatest strength it is advisable to build these arches in
  independent rings of half-brick thickness. The undermost rings should
  have thin joints, those of each succeeding ring being slightly thickened.
  This prevents the lowest ring from settling while those above remain in
  position, which would cause an ugly fissure. In work of large span
  bonding blocks or "lacing courses" should be built into the arch, set in
  cement and running through its thickness at intervals, care being taken
  to introduce the lacing course at a place where the joints of the various
  rings coincide. Stone blocks in the shape of a voussoir (fig. 14) may be
  used instead. Except for these lacing courses hydraulic lime mortar
  should be used for large arches, on account of its slightly accommodating
  nature.</p>

  <p>Rough-cut arches are those in which the bricks are roughly cut with an
  axe to a wedge form; they are used over openings, such as doors and
  windows, where a strong arch of neat appearance is desired. The joints
  are usually made equal in width to those of the ordinary brickwork.
  Gauged arches are composed of specially made soft bricks, which are cut
  and rubbed to gauges or templates so as to form perfectly fitting
  voussoirs. Gauging is, of course, equally applicable to arches and
  walling, as it means no more than bringing every brick exactly to a
  certain form by cutting and rubbing. Gauged brickwork is set in lime
  putty instead of common mortar; the finished joints should not be more
  than 1/32 in. wide. To give stability the sides of the voussoirs are
  gauged out hollow and grouted in Portland cement, thus connecting each
  brick with the next by a joggle joint. Gauged arches, being for the most
  part but a half-brick in thickness on the soffit and not being tied by a
  bond to anything behind them&mdash;for behind them is the lintel with
  rough discharging arch over, supporting the remaining width of the
  wall&mdash;require to be executed with great care and nicety. It is a
  common fault with workmen to rub the bricks thinner behind than before to
  lessen the labour required to obtain a very fine face joint. This
  practice tends to make the work bulge outwards; it should rather be
  inverted if it be done at all, though the best work is that in which the
  bricks are gauged to exactly the same thickness at the back as at the
  front. The same fault occurs when a gauged arch is inserted in an old
  wall, on account of the difficulty of filling up with cement the space
  behind the bricks.</p>

  <p>The bond of an arch obtains its name from the arrangement of headers
  and stretchers on its soffit. The under side of an arch built in English
  bond, therefore, will show the same arrangement as the face of a wall
  built in English bond. If the arch is in Flemish the soffit presents the
  same appearance as the elevation of a wall built in that bond.</p>

  <p>It is generally held that the building of wood into brickwork <span
  class="sidenote">Plates.</span> should as far as is possible be avoided.
  Wall plates of wood are, however, necessary where wood joists are used,
  and where these plates may not be supported on corbels of projecting
  brickwork or iron they must be let flush into the wall, taking the place
  of a course of bricks. They form a uniform bed for the joists, to which
  easy fixing is obtained. The various modes adopted for resting and fixing
  the ends of joists on walls are treated in the article <span
  class="sc">Carpentry</span>.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:50%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 15.
  </div>
  <p>Lintels, which may be of iron, steel, plain or reinforced concrete, or
  stone, are used over square-headed openings instead of or in conjunction
  with arches. They are useful to preserve the square form and receive the
  joiners' fittings, but except when made of steel or of concrete
  reinforced with steel bars, they should have relieving arches turned
  immediately over them (Fig.15).</p>

  <p>"Fixing bricks" were formerly of wood of the same size as the ordinary
  brick, and built into the wall as required for fixing joinery. Owing to
  their liability to shrinkage and decay, their use is now practically
  abandoned, their place being taken by bricks of coke-breeze concrete,
  which do not shrink or rot and hold fast nails or screws driven into
  them. Another method often adopted for <!-- Page 527 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page527"></a>[v.04 p.0527]</span>providing a
  fixing for joinery is to build in wood slips the thickness of a joint and
  4½ in. wide. When suitable provision for fixing has not been made, wood
  plugs are driven into the joints of the bricks. Great care must be taken
  in driving these in the joints of reveals or at the corners of walls, or
  damage may be done.</p>

  <p>The name "brick-ashlar" is given to walls faced with ashlar stonework
  backed in with brickwork. Such constructions are liable in an aggravated
  degree to the unequal settling and its attendant evils pointed out as
  existing in walls built with different qualities of bricks. The outer
  face is composed of unyielding stone with few and very thin joints, which
  perhaps do not occupy more than a hundredth part of its height, while the
  back is built up of bricks with about one-eighth its height composed of
  mortar joints, that is, of a material that by its nature and manner of
  application must both shrink in drying and yield to pressure. To obviate
  this tendency to settle and thus cause the bulging of the face or failure
  of the wall, the mortar used should be composed of Portland cement and
  sand with a large proportion of the former, and worked as stiff as it
  conveniently can be. In building such work the stones should be in height
  equal to an exact number of brick courses. It is a common practice in
  erecting buildings with a facing of Kentish rag rubble to back up the
  stonework with bricks. Owing to the great irregularity of the stones,
  great difficulty is experienced in obtaining proper bond between the two
  materials. Through bonding stones or headers should be frequently built
  in, and the whole of the work executed in cement mortar to ensure
  stability.</p>

  <p>Not the least important part of the bricklayer's art is the formation
  of chimney and other flues. Considerable skill is required in <span
  class="sidenote">Chimneys and flues.</span> gathering-over properly above
  the fireplace so as to conduct the smoke into the smaller flue, which
  itself requires to be built with precision, so that its capacity may not
  vary in different parts. Bends must be made in gradual curves so as to
  offer the least possible resistance to the up-draught, and at least one
  bend of not less than 60° should be formed in each flue to intercept
  down-draughts. Every fireplace must have a separate flue. The collection
  of a number of flues into a "stack" is economical, and tends to increase
  the efficiency of the flues, the heat from one flue assisting the
  up-draught in those adjoining it. It is also desirable from an aesthetic
  point of view, for a number of single flue chimneys sticking up from
  various parts of the roof would appear most unsightly. The architects of
  the Elizabethan and later periods were masters of this difficult art of
  treating a stack or stacks as an architectural feature. The shaft should
  be carried well above the roof, higher, if possible, than adjacent
  buildings, which are apt to cause down-draught and make the chimney
  smoke. When this is found impossible, one of the many forms of patent
  chimney-pots or revolving cowls must be adopted. Each flue must be
  separated by smoke-proof "withes" or divisions, usually half a brick in
  thickness; connexion between them causes smoky chimneys. The size of the
  flue for an ordinary grate is 14×9 in.; for a kitchen stove 14×14 in. The
  outer wall of a chimney stack may with advantage be made 9 in. thick.
  Fireclay tubes, rectangular or circular in transverse section, are
  largely used in place of the pargetting; although more expensive than the
  latter they have the advantage in point of cleanliness and durability.
  Fireplaces generally require more depth than can be provided in the
  thickness of the wall, and therefore necessitate a projection to contain
  the fireplace and flues, called the "chimney breast." Sometimes,
  especially when the wall is an external one, the projection may be made
  on the back, thus allowing a flush wall in the room and giving more space
  and a more conveniently-shaped room. The projection on the outside face
  of the wall may be treated as an ornamental feature. The fireplace
  opening is covered by a brick relieving arch, which is fortified by
  wrought-iron bar from ½ to ¾ in. thick and 2 to 3 in. wide. It is usually
  bent to a "camber," and the brick arch built upon it naturally takes the
  same curve. Each end is "caulked," that is, split longitudinally and
  turned up and down. The interior of a chimney breast behind the stove
  should always be filled in solid with concrete or brickwork. The flooring
  in the chimney opening is called the "hearth"; the back hearth covers the
  space between the jambs of the chimney breast, and the front hearth rests
  upon the brick "trimmer arch" designed to support it. The hearth is now
  often formed in solid concrete, supported on the brick wall and fillets
  fixed to the floor joists, without any trimmer arch and finished in neat
  cement or glazed tiles instead of stone slabs.</p>

  <p>Tall furnace chimneys should stand as separate constructions,
  unconnected with other buildings. If it is necessary to bring other work
  close up, a straight joint should be used. The shaft of the chimney will
  be built "overhand," the men working from the inside. Lime mortar is
  used, cement being too rigid to allow the chimney to rock in the wind.
  Not more than 3 ft. in height should be erected in one day, the work of
  necessity being done in small portions to allow the mortar to set before
  it is required to sustain much weight. The bond usually adopted is one
  course of headers to four of stretchers. Scaffolding is sometimes erected
  outside for a height of 25 or 30 ft., to facilitate better pointing,
  especially where the chimney is in a prominent position. The brickwork at
  the top must, according to the London Building Act, be 9 in. thick (it is
  better 14 in. in shafts over 100 ft. high), increasing half a brick in
  thickness for every additional 20 ft. measured downwards. "The shaft
  shall taper gradually from the base to the top at the rate of at least 2½
  in. in 10 ft. of height. The width of the base of the shaft if square
  shall be at least one-tenth of the proposed height of the shaft, or if
  round or any other shape, then one-twelfth of the height. Firebricks
  built inside the lower portion of the shaft shall be provided, as
  additional to and independent of the prescribed thickness of brickwork,
  and shall not be bonded therewith." The firebrick lining should be
  carried up from about 25 ft. for ordinary temperatures to double that
  height for very great ones, a space of 1½ to 3 in. being kept between the
  lining and the main wall. The lining itself is usually 4½ in. thick. The
  cap is usually of cast iron or terra-cotta strengthened with iron bolts
  and straps, and sometimes of stone, but the difficulty of properly fixing
  this latter material causes it to be neglected in favour of one of the
  former. (See a paper by F.J. Bancroft on "Chimney Construction," which
  contains a tabulated description of nearly sixty shafts, <i>Proc. Civ.
  and Mech. Eng. Soc.</i>, December 1883.)</p>

  <p>The work of laying bricks or tiles as paving falls to the lot of the
  bricklayer. Paving formed of ordinary bricks laid flat or on their <span
  class="sidenote">Brick paving.</span> edges was once in general use, but
  is now almost abandoned in favour of floors of special tiles or cement
  paving, the latter being practically non-porous and therefore more
  sanitary and cleaner. Special bricks of extremely hard texture are made
  for stable and similar paving, having grooves worked on the face to
  assist drainage and afford good foothold. A bed of concrete 6 in. thick
  is usually provided under paving, or when the bricks are placed on edge
  the concrete for external paving may be omitted and the bricks bedded in
  sand, the ground being previously well rammed. The side joints of the
  bricks are grouted in with lime or cement. Dutch clinkers are small, hard
  paving bricks burned at a high temperature and of a light yellow colour;
  they are 6 in. long, 3 in. wide, 1½ in. thick. A variety of paving tile
  called "oven tiles" is of similar material to the ordinary red brick, and
  in size is 10 or 12 in. square and 1 to 2 in. thick. An immense variety
  of ornamental paving and walling tiles is now manufactured of different
  colours, sizes and shapes, and the use of these for lining sculleries,
  lavatories, bathrooms, provision shops, &amp;c., makes for cleanliness
  and improved sanitary conditions. Besides, however, being put to these
  uses, tiles are often used in the ornamentation of buildings, externally
  as well as internally.</p>

  <p>Mosaic work is composed of small pieces of marble, stone, glass or
  pottery, laid as paving or wall lining, usually in some ornamental
  pattern or design. A firm bed of concrete is required, the pieces of <!--
  Page 528 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page528"></a>[v.04
  p.0528]</span>material being fixed in a float of cement about half or
  three-quarters of an inch thick. Roman mosaic is formed with cubes of
  marble of various colours pressed into the float. A less costly paving
  may be obtained by strewing irregularly-shaped marble chips over the
  floated surface: these are pressed into the cement with a plasterer's
  hand float, and the whole is then rolled with an iron roller. This is
  called "terazzo mosaic." In either the Roman or terazzo method any
  patterns or designs that are introduced are first worked in position, the
  ground-work being filled in afterwards. For the use of cement for paving

  Catholíc faith the Protestants of France. He gained their good-will and
  made many converts; and for over forty years he visited as a missionary
  preacher almost every town of central and southern France. In Paris, in
  1744, his sermons created a deep impression by their eloquence and
  sincerity. He died at Roquemaure, near Avignon, on the 22nd of December
  1767. He was the author of <i>Cantiques spirituels</i> (Montpelier, 1748,
  frequently reprinted, in use in most French churches); his sermons were
  published in 5 vols. at Avignon in 1823 (ed. Paris, 1861).</p>

  <p><b>BRIDE</b> (a common Teutonic word, e.g. Goth. <i>bruths</i>, O.Eng.
  <i>bryd</i>, O.H.Ger. <i>prût</i>, Mod. Ger. <i>Braut</i>, Dut.
  <i>bruid</i>, possibly derived from the root <i>bru-</i>, cook, brew;
  from the med. latinized form <i>bruta</i>, in the sense of
  daughter-in-law, is derived the Fr. <i>bru</i>), the term used of a woman
  on her wedding-day, and applicable during the first year of wifehood. It
  appears in combination with many words, some of them obsolete. Thus
  "bridegroom" is the newly married man, and "bride-bell," "bride-banquet"
  are old equivalents of wedding-bells, wedding-breakfast. "Bridal" (from
  <i>Bride-ale</i>), originally the wedding-feast itself, has grown into a
  general descriptive adjective, e.g. the <i>bridal</i> party, the
  <i>bridal</i> ceremony. The <i>bride-cake</i> had its origin in the Roman
  <i>confarreatio</i>, a form of marriage, the essential features of which
  were the eating by the couple of a cake made of salt, water and flour,
  and the holding by the bride of three wheat-ears, symbolical of plenty.
  Under Tiberius the cake-eating fell into disuse, but the wheat ears
  survived. In the middle ages they were either worn or carried by the
  bride. Eventually it became the custom for the young girls to assemble
  outside the church porch and throw grains of wheat over the bride, and
  afterwards a scramble for the grains took place. In time the wheat-grains
  came to be cooked into thin dry biscuits, which were broken over the
  bride's head, as is the custom in Scotland to-day, an oatmeal cake being
  used. In Elizabeth's reign these biscuits began to take the form of small
  rectangular cakes made of eggs, milk, sugar, currants and spices. Every
  wedding guest had one at least, and the whole collection were thrown at
  the bride the instant she crossed the threshold. Those which lighted on
  her head or shoulders were most prized by the scramblers. At last these
  cakes became amalgamated into a large one which took on its full glories
  of almond paste and ornaments during Charles II.'s time. But even to-day
  in rural parishes, e.g. north Notts, wheat is thrown over the bridal
  couple with the cry "Bread for life and pudding for ever," expressive of
  a wish that the newly wed may be always affluent. The throwing of rice, a
  very ancient custom but one later than the wheat, is symbolical of the
  wish that the bridal may be fruitful. The <i>bride-cup</i> was the bowl
  or loving-cup in which the bridegroom pledged the bride, and she him. The
  custom of breaking this wine-cup, after the bridal couple had drained its
  contents, is common to both the Jews and the members of the Greek Church.
  The former dash it against the wall or on the ground, the latter tread it
  under foot. The phrase "bride-cup" was also sometimes used of the bowl of
  spiced wine prepared at night for the bridal couple.
  <i>Bride-favours</i>, anciently called bride-lace, were at first pieces
  of gold, silk or other lace, used to bind up the sprigs of rosemary
  formerly worn at weddings. These took later the form of bunches of
  ribbons, which were at last metamorphosed into rosettes.
  <i>Bridegroom-men</i> and <i>bridesmaids</i> had formerly important
  duties. The men were called bride-knights, and represented a survival of
  the primitive days of marriage by capture, when a man called his friends
  in to assist to "lift" the bride. Bridesmaids were usual in Saxon
  England. The senior of them had personally to attend the bride for some
  days before the wedding. The making of the bridal wreath, the decoration
  of the tables for the wedding feast, the dressing of the bride, were
  among her special tasks. In the same way the senior groomsman (the
  <i>best man</i>) was the personal attendant of the husband. The
  <i>bride-wain</i>, the wagon in which the bride was driven to her new
  home, gave its name to the weddings of any poor deserving couple, who
  drove a "wain" round the village, collecting small sums of money or
  articles of furniture towards their housekeeping. These were called
  bidding-weddings, or bid-ales, which were in the nature of "benefit"
  feasts. So general is still the custom of "bidding-weddings" in Wales,
  that printers usually keep the form of invitation in type. Sometimes as
  many as six hundred couples will walk in the bridal procession. The
  <i>bride's wreath</i> is a Christian substitute for the gilt coronet all
  Jewish brides wore. The crowning of the bride is still observed by the
  Russians, and the Calvinists of Holland and Switzerland. The wearing of
  orange blossoms is said to have started with the Saracens, who regarded
  them as emblems of fecundity. It was introduced into Europe by the
  Crusaders. The <i>bride's veil</i> is the modern form of the
  <i>flammeum</i> or large yellow veil which completely enveloped the Greek
  and Roman brides during the ceremony. Such a covering is still in use
  among the Jews and the Persians.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDEWELL,</b> a district of London between Fleet Street and the
  Thames, so called from the well of St Bride or St Bridget close by. From
  William the Conqueror's time, a castle or Norman tower, long the
  occasional residence of the kings of England, stood there by the Fleet
  ditch. Henry VIII., Stow says, built there "a stately and beautiful
  house," specially for the housing of the emperor Charles V. and his suite
  in 1525. During the hearing of the divorce suit by the Cardinals at
  Blackfriars, Henry and Catharine of Aragon lived there. In 1553 Edward
  VI. made it over to the city as a penitentiary, a house of correction for
  vagabonds and loose women; and it was formally taken possession of by the
  lord mayor and corporation in 1555. The greater part of the building was
  destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. New Bridewell, built in 1829, was
  pulled down in 1864. The term has become a synonym for any
  reformatory.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGE,</b> a game of cards, developed out of the game of whist.
  The country of its origin is unknown. A similar game is said to have been
  played in Denmark in the middle of the 19th century. A game in all
  respects the same as bridge, except that in "no trumps" each trick
  counted ten instead of twelve, was played in England about 1884 under the
  name of Dutch whist. Some connect it with Turkey and Egypt under the name
  of "Khedive," or with a Russian game called "Yeralash." It was in Turkey
  that it first won a share of popular favour. Under the synonyms of
  "Biritch," "Bridge," or "Russian whist," it found its way to the London
  clubs about 1894, from which date its popularity rapidly increased.</p>

  <p><i>Ordinary Bridge.</i>&mdash;Bridge, in its ordinary form, differs
  from <!-- Page 529 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page529"></a>[v.04
  p.0529]</span>whist in the following respects:&mdash;Although there are
  four players, yet in each hand the partner of the dealer takes no part in
  the play of that particular hand. After the first lead his cards are
  placed on the table exposed, and are played by the dealer as at dummy
  whist; nevertheless the dealer's partner is interested in the result of
  the hand equally with the dealer. The trump suit is not determined by the
  last card dealt, but is selected by the dealer or his partner without
  consultation, the former having the first option. It is further open to
  them to play without a trump suit. The value of tricks and honours varies
  with the suit declared as trumps. Honours are reckoned differently from
  whist, and on a scale which is somewhat involved. The score for honours
  does not count towards winning or losing the rubber, but is added
  afterwards to the trick score in order to determine the value of the
  rubber. There are also scores for holding no trumps ("chicane"), and for
  winning all the tricks or all but one ("slam").</p>

  <p>The score has to be kept on paper. It is usual for the scoring block
  to have two vertical columns divided halfway by a horizontal line. The
  left column is for the scorers' side, and the right for the opponents'.
  Honours are scored above the horizontal line, and tricks below. The
  drawback to this arrangement is that, since the scores for each hand are
  not kept separately, it is generally impossible to trace an error in the
  score without going through the whole series of hands. A better plan, it
  seems, is to have four columns ruled, the inner two being assigned to
  tricks, the outer ones to honours. By this method a line can be reserved
  for each hand, and any discrepancy in the scores at once rectified.</p>

  <p>The Portland Club, London, drew up a code of laws in 1895, and this
  code, with a few amendments, was in July 1895 adopted by a joint
  committee of the Turf and Portland Clubs. A revised code came into force
  in January 1905, the provisions of which are here summarized.</p>

  <p>Each trick above 6 counts 2 points in a spade declaration, 4 in a
  club, 6 in a diamond, 8 in a heart, 12 in a no-trump declaration. The
  game consists of 30 points made by tricks alone. When one side has won
  two games the rubber is ended. The winners are entitled to add 100 points
  to their score. Honours consist of ace, king, queen, knave, ten, in a
  suit declaration. If a player and his partner conjointly hold 3 (or
  "simple") honours they score twice the value of a trick; if 4 honours, 4
  times; if 5 honours, 5 times. If a player in his own hand hold 4 honours
  he is entitled to score 4 honours in addition to the score for conjoint
  honours; thus, if one player hold 4 honours and his partner the other
  their total score is 9 by honours. Similarly if a player hold 5 honours
  in his own hand he is entitled to score 10 by honours. If in a no-trump
  hand the partners conjointly hold 3 aces, they score 30 for honours; if 4
  aces, 40 for honours. 4 aces in 1 hand count 100. On the same footing as
  the score for honours are the following: <i>chicane</i>, if a player hold
  no trump, in amount equal to simple honours; <i>grand slam</i>, if one
  side win all the tricks, 40 points; <i>little slam</i>, if they win 12
  tricks, 20 points. At the end of the rubber the total scores, whether
  made by tricks, honours, chicane, slam, or rubber points, are added
  together, and the difference between the two totals is the number of
  points won.</p>

  <p>At the opening of play, partners are arranged and the cards are
  shuffled, cut and dealt (the last card not being turned) as at whist; but
  the dealer cannot lose the deal by misdealing. After the deal is
  completed, the dealer makes the trump or no-trump (<i>sans atout</i>)
  declaration, or passes the choice to his partner without remark. If the
  dealer's partner make the declaration out of his turn, the adversary on
  the dealer's left may, without consultation, claim a fresh deal. If an
  adversary make a declaration, the dealer may claim a fresh deal or
  disregard the declaration. Then after the declaration, either adversary
  may double, the leader having first option. The effect of doubling is
  that each trick is worth twice as many points as before; but the scores
  for honours, chicane and slam are unaltered. If a declaration is doubled,
  the dealer and his partner have the right of redoubling, thus making each
  trick worth four times as much as at first. The declarer has the first
  option. The other side can again redouble, and so on; but the value of a
  trick is limited to 100 points. In the play of the hand the laws are
  nearly the same as the laws of whist, except that the dealer may expose
  his cards and lead out of turn without penalty; after the second hand has
  played, however, he can only correct this lead out of turn with the
  permission of the adversaries. Dummy cannot revoke. The dealer's partner
  may take no part in the play of the hand beyond guarding the dealer
  against revoking.</p>

  <p><i>Advice to Players.</i>&mdash;In the choice of a suit two objects
  are to be aimed at: first, to select the suit in which the combined
  forces have the best chance of making tricks; secondly, to select the
  trump so that the value of the suit agrees with the character of the
  hand, <i>i.e.</i> a suit of high value when the hands are strong and of
  low value when very weak. As the deal is a great advantage it generally
  happens that a high value is to be aimed at, but occasionally a low value
  is desirable. The task of selection should fall to the hand which has the
  most distinctive features, that is, either the longest suit or unusual
  strength or weakness. No consultation being allowed, the dealer must
  assume only an average amount of variation from the normal in his
  partner's hand. If his own hand has distinctive features beyond the
  average, he should name the trump suit himself, otherwise pass it to his
  partner. It may here be stated what is the average in these respects.</p>

  <p>As regards the length of a suit, a player's long suit is rather more
  likely to be fewer than five than over five. If the dealer has in his
  hand a suit of five cards including two honours, it is probable that he
  has a better suit to make trumps than dummy; if the suit is in hearts,
  and the dealer has a fair hand, he ought to name the trump. As regards
  strength, the average hand would contain ace, king, queen, knave and ten,
  or equivalent strength. Hands stronger or weaker than this by the value
  of a king or less may be described as featureless. If the dealer's hand
  is a king over the average, it is more likely than not that his partner
  will either hold a stronger hand, or will hold such a weak hand as will
  counteract the player's strength. The dealer would not generally with
  such a hand declare no trump, especially as by making a no-trump
  declaration the dealer forfeits the advantage of holding the long
  trumps.</p>

  <p><i>Declarations by Dealer.</i>&mdash;In calculating the strength of a
  hand a knave is worth two tens, a queen is worth two knaves, a king is
  worth a queen and knave together, and an ace is worth a king and queen
  together. A king unguarded is worth less than a queen guarded; a queen is
  not fully guarded unless accompanied by three more cards; if guarded by
  one small card it is worth a knave guarded. An ace also loses in value by
  being sole.</p>

  <p>A hand to be strong enough for a no-trump declaration should be a king
  and ten above the average with all the honours guarded and all the suits
  protected. It must be a king and knave or two queens above the average if
  there is protection in three suits. It must be an ace or a king and queen
  above the average if only two suits are protected. An established black
  suit of six or more cards with a guarded king as card of entry is good
  enough for no trumps. With three aces no trumps can be declared. Without
  an ace, four kings, two queens and a knave are required in order to
  justify the declaration. When the dealer has a choice of declarations, a
  sound heart make is to be preferred to a doubtful no-trump. Four honours
  in hearts are to be preferred to any but a very strong no-trump
  declaration; but four aces counting 100 points constitute a no-trump
  declaration without exception.</p>

  <p>Six hearts should be made trumps and five with two honours unless the
  hand is very weak; five hearts with one honour or four hearts with three
  honours should be declared if the hand is nearly strong enough for no
  trumps, also if the hand is very irregular with one suit missing or five
  of a black suit. Six diamonds with one honour, five with three honours or
  four all honours should be declared; weaker diamonds should be declared
  if the suits are irregular, especially if blank in hearts. Six clubs with
  three honours or five with four honours should be declared. Spades are
  practically only declared with a weak hand; with only a king in the hand
  a suit of five spades should be declared as a defensive measure. With
  nothing above a ten a suit of two or three spades can be declared, though
  even with the weakest hands a suit of five clubs or of six red cards will
  probably prove less expensive.</p>

  <p><i>Declarations by Dummy.</i>&mdash;From the fact that the call has
  been passed, the dealer's partner must credit the dealer with less than
  average strength as regards the rank of his cards, and probably a
  slightly increased number of black cards; he must therefore be more
  backward in making a high declaration whenever he can make a sound
  declaration of less value. On the other hand, he has not the option of
  passing the declaration, and may be driven to declare on less strength
  because the only alternative is a short suit of spades. For example, with
  the hand: Hearts, ace, kv. 2; diamonds, qn. 9, 7, 6, 3; clubs, kg. 10, 4;
  spades, 9, 2, the chances are in the dealer's favour with five trumps,
  but decidedly against with only two, and the diamond declaration is to be
  preferred to the spade. Still, a hand may be so weak that spades should
  be declared with two or less, but five clubs or six diamonds would be
  preferable with the weakest of hands.</p>

<p><!-- Page 530 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page530"></a>[v.04 p.0530]</span></p>

  <p><i>Declarations to the Score.</i>&mdash;When one's score is over
  twenty, club declarations should be made more frequently by the dealer.
  Spades should be declared with six at the score of twenty-six and with
  five at twenty-eight. When much behind in the score a risky no-trumper
  such as one with an established suit of seven or eight cards without a
  card of entry, may be declared.</p>

  <p>Declaring to the score is often overdone; an ordinary weak no-trump
  declaration carries with it small chances of three by tricks unless dummy
  holds a no-trump hand.</p>

  <p><i>Doubling.</i>&mdash;Practically the leader only doubles a no-trump
  declaration when he holds what is probably an established suit of seven
  cards or a suit which can be established with the loss of one trick and
  he has good cards of re-entry. Seven cards of a suit including the ace,
  king and queen make sound double without any other card of value in the
  hand, or six cards including king, queen and knave with two aces in other
  suits.</p>

  <p>Doubling by the third hand is universally understood to mean that the
  player has a very strong suit which he can establish. In response to the
  double his partner, according to different conventions, leads either a
  heart or his own shortest suit as the one most likely to be the third
  player's strongest. Under the short suit convention, if the doubler holds
  six of a suit headed by the ace, king and queen, it is about an even
  chance that his suit will be selected; he should not double with less
  strength. Under the heart convention it is not necessary to have such
  great strength; with a strong suit of six hearts and good cards of
  re-entry, enough tricks will be saved to compensate for the doubled
  value. A player should ascertain the convention followed before beginning
  to play.</p>

  <p>Before doubling a suit declaration a player should feel almost certain
  that he is as strong as the declarer. The minimum strength to justify the
  declaration is generally five trumps, but it may have been made on six.
  If, then, a player holds six trumps with an average hand as regards the
  rank of his cards, or five trumps with a hand of no-trump strength, it is
  highly probable that he is as strong as the declarer. It must be further
  taken into account that the act of doubling gives much valuable
  information to the dealer, who would otherwise play with the expectation
  of finding the trumps evenly distributed; this is counterbalanced when
  the doubler is on the left of the declaring hand by the intimation given
  to his partner to lead trumps through the strong hand. In this position,
  then, the player should double with the strength stated above. When on
  the declarer's right, the player should hold much greater strength unless
  his hand is free from tenaces. When a spade declaration has been made by
  dummy, one trump less is necessary and the doubler need not be on the
  declarer's left. A spade declaration by the dealer can be doubled with
  even less strength. A declaration can be rather more freely doubled when
  a single trick undoubled will take the dealer out, but even in this
  position the player must be cautious of informing the dealer that there
  is a strong hand against him.</p>

  <p><i>Redoubling.</i>&mdash;When a declaration has been doubled, the
  declarer knows the minimum that he will find against him; he must be
  prepared to find occasionally strength against him considerably exceeding
  this minimum. Except in the case of a spade declaration, cases in which
  redoubling is justifiable are very rare.</p>

  <p><i>The Play of the Hand.</i>&mdash;In a no-trump declaration the main
  object is to bring in a long suit. In selecting the suit to establish,
  the following are favourable conditions:&mdash;One hand should hold at
  least five cards of the suit. The two hands, unless with a sequence of
  high cards, should hold between them eight cards of the suit, so as to
  render it probable that the suit will be established in three rounds. The
  hand which contains the strong suit should be sufficiently strong in
  cards of re-entry. The suit should not be so full of possible tenaces as
  to make it disadvantageous to open it. As regards the play of the cards
  in a suit, it is not the object to make tricks early, but to make all
  possible tricks. Deep finesses should be made when there is no other way
  of stealing a trick. Tricks may be given away, if by so doing a
  favourable opening can be made for a finesse. When, however, it is
  doubtful with which hand the finesse should be made, it is better to
  leave it as late as possible, since the card to be finessed against may
  fall, or an adversary may fail, thus disclosing the suit. It is in
  general unsound to finesse against a card that must be unguarded. From a
  hand short in cards of re-entry, winning cards should not be led out so
  as to exhaust the suit from the partner's hand. Even a trick should
  sometimes be given away. For instance, if one hand holds seven cards
  headed by ace, king, and the other hand hold's only two of the suit,
  although there is a fair chance of making seven tricks in the suit, it
  would often be right to give the first trick to the adversaries. When one
  of the adversaries has shown a long suit, it is frequently possible to
  prevent its being brought in by a device, such as holding up a winning
  card, until the suit is exhausted from his partner's hand, or playing in
  other suits so as to give the player the lead whilst his partner his a
  card of his suit to return, and to give the latter the lead when he has
  no card to return. The dealer should give as little information as
  possible as to what he holds in his own hand, playing frequent false
  cards. Usually he should play the higher or highest of a sequence; still,
  there are positions in which playing the higher gives more information
  than the lower; a strict adherence to a rule in itself assists the
  adversaries.</p>

  <p>With a suit declaration, if there is no chance of letting the weak
  hand make a trump by ruffing, it will generally be the dealer's aim to
  discard the losing cards in the declaring hand either to high cards or to
  the cards of an established suit in the other hand, sometimes after the
  adverse trumps have been taken out, but often before, there being no time
  for drawing trumps. With no card of any value in a suit in one hand, the
  lead should come from that hand, but it is better, if possible, to let
  the adversaries open the suit. It is generally useless to lead a
  moderately high card from the weaker hand in order to finesse it, when
  holding no cards in sequence with it in either hand. Sometimes
  (especially in no-trumps) it is the better play to make the weak hand
  third player. For instance, with king, 8, 7, 5, 2 in one hand, knave, 4
  in the other, the best way of opening is from the hand that holds five
  cards.</p>

  <p>In a no-trump declaration the opponents of the dealer should endeavour
  to find the longest suit in the two hands, or the one most easily
  established. With this object the leader should open his best suit. If
  his partner next obtains the lead he ought to return the suit, unless he
  himself has a suit which he considers better, having due regard to the
  fact that the first suit is already partially established. The opponents
  should employ the same tactics as the dealer to prevent the latter from
  bringing in a long suit; they can use them with special effect when the
  long suit is in the exposed hand.</p>

  <p>Against no-trumps the leader should not play his winning cards unless
  he has a good chance of clearing the suit without help from his partner;
  in most cases it is advisable to give away the first trick, especially if
  he has no card of re-entry, in order that his partner on gaining the lead
  may have a card of the suit to return; but holding ace, king and queen,
  or ace, king with seven in the suit, or ace, king, knave, ten with six,
  the player may lead out his best. With three honours any two of which are
  in sequence (not to the ace) the player should lead the higher of the
  sequence. He should lead his highest card from queen, knave, ten; from
  queen, knave, nine; from knave, ten, nine; knave, ten, eight, and ten,
  nine, eight. In other cases the player should lead a small card;
  according to the usual convention, the fourth best. His partner, and also
  the dealer, can credit him with three cards higher than the card led, and
  can often place the cards of the suit: for instance, the seven is led,
  dummy holds queen and eight, playing the queen, the third player holds
  the nine and smaller cards; the unseen cards higher than the seven are
  ace, king, knave and ten of which the leader must hold three; he cannot
  hold both knave and ten or he would have led the knave; he must therefore
  hold the ace, king and either knave or ten. The "eleven" rule is as
  follows: the number of pips in the card led subtracted from eleven
  (11-7=4 in the case stated) gives the number of cards higher than the one
  led not in the leader's hand; the three cards seen (queen, nine and
  eight) leave one for the dealer to hold. The mental process is no shorter
  than assigning three out of the unseen cards to the leader, and by not
  noting the unseen cards much valuable information may be missed, as in
  the illustrative case given.</p>

  <p>With a suit declared the best opening lead is a singleton, failing
  which a lead from a strong sequence. A lead from a tenace or a guarded
  king or queen is to be avoided. Two small cards may be led from, though
  the lead is objected to by some. A suit of three small cards of no great
  strength should not be opened. In cases of doubt preference should be
  given to hearts and to a less extent to diamonds.</p>

  <p>To lead up to dummy's weak suits is a valuable rule. The converse, to
  lead through strength, must be used with caution, and does not apply to
  no-trump declarations. It is not advisable to adopt any of the recent
  whist methods of giving information. It is clear that, if the adversaries
  signal, the dealer's hand alone is a secret, and he, in addition to his
  natural advantage, has the further advantage of better information than
  either of the adversaries. The following signals are however, used, and
  are of great trick-making value: playing an unnecessarily high card,
  whether to one's partner's suit or in discarding in a no-trump
  declaration, indicates strength in the suit; in a suit declaration a
  similar method of play indicates two only of the suit and a desire to
  ruff,&mdash;it is best used in the case of a king led by one's
  partner.</p>

  <p>The highest of a sequence led through dummy will frequently tell the
  third player that he has a good finesse. The lowest of a sequence led
  through the dealer will sometimes explain the position to the third
  player, at the same time keeping the dealer in the dark.</p>

  <p>When on dummy's left it is futile to finesse against a card not in
  dummy's hand. But with ace and knave, if dummy has either king or queen,
  the knave should usually be played, partly because the other high card
  may be in the leader's hand, partly because, if the finesse fails, the
  player may still hold a tenace over dummy. When a player is with any
  chance of success trying to establish his long suit, he should keep every
  card of it if possible, whether it is a suit already opened or a suit
  which he wishes his partner to lead; when, however, the main object of
  the hand is to establish one's partner's suit, it is not necessary for a
  player to keep his own long suit, and he should pay attention to guarding
  the other suits. In some circles a discard from a suit is always
  understood to indicate strength in the suit; this convention, while it
  makes the game easier for inferior players, frequently causes the player
  to throw away one of his most valuable cards.</p>

  <p><i>Playing to the Score.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of the hand the
  chances are so great against any particular result, that at the score of
  love-all the advantage of getting to any particular score has no
  appreciable <!-- Page 531 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page531"></a>[v.04 p.0531]</span>effect in determining the choice
  of suit. In the play of the hand, the advantage of getting to certain
  points should be borne in mind. The principal points to be aimed at are
  6, 18, and, in a less degree, 22. The reason is that the scores 24, 12
  and 8, which will just take the dealer out from the respective points,
  can each be made in a variety of ways, and are the most common for the
  dealer to make. The 2 points that take the score from 4 to 6 are worth 4,
  or perhaps 5, average points; and the 2 points that take the score from 6
  to 8 are worth 1 point. When approaching game it is an advantage to make
  a declaration that may just take the player out, and, in a smaller
  degree, one that will not exactly take the adversaries out. When the
  score is 24 to 22 against the dealer, hearts and clubs are half a trick
  better relatively to diamonds than at the score of love-all. In the first
  and second games of the rubber the value of each point scored for honours
  is probably about a half of a point scored for tricks&mdash;in a close
  game rather less, in a one-sided game rather more. In the deciding game
  of the rubber, on account of the importance of winning the game, the
  value of each point scored for honours sinks to one-third of a point
  scored for tricks.</p>

  <p><i>Other Forms of Bridge.</i>&mdash;The following varieties of the
  game are also played:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Three-handed Bridge.</i>&mdash;The three players cut; the one that
  cuts the lowest card deals, and takes dummy for one deal: each takes
  dummy in turn. Dummy's cards are dealt face downwards, and the dealer
  declares without seeing them. If the dealer declares trumps, both
  adversaries may look at their hands; doubling and redoubling proceeds as
  at ordinary bridge, but dummy's hand is not exposed till the first card
  has been led. If the dealer passes the declaration to dummy, his
  right-hand adversary, who must not have looked at his own hand, examines
  dummy's, and declares trumps, not, however, exposing the hand. The
  declaration is forced: with three or four aces <i>sans atout</i> (no
  trumps) must be declared: in other cases the longest suit: if suits are
  equal in length, the strongest, <i>i.e.</i> the suit containing most
  pips, ace counting eleven, king, queen and knave counting ten each. If
  suits are equal in both length and strength, the one in which the trick
  has the higher value must be trumps. On the dummy's declaration the third
  player can only double before seeing his own cards. When the first card
  has been led, dummy's hand is exposed, never before the lead. The game is
  30: the player wins the rubber who is the first to win two games. Fifty
  points are scored for each game won, and fifty more for the rubber.
  Sometimes three games are played without reference to a rubber, fifty
  points being scored for a game won. No tricks score towards game except
  those which a player wins in his own deal; the value of tricks won in
  other deals is scored above the line with honours, slam and chicane. At
  the end of the rubber the totals are added up, and the points won or lost
  are adjusted thus. Suppose A is credited with 212, B with 290, and C with
  312, then A owes 78 to B and 100 to C; B owes 22 to C.</p>

  <p><i>Dummy Bridge.</i>&mdash;The player who cuts the lowest card takes
  dummy. Dummy deals the first hand of all. The player who takes dummy
  always looks at his own hand first, when he deals for himself or for
  dummy; he can either declare trumps or "leave it" to dummy. Dummy's
  declaration is compulsory, as in three-handed bridge. When the dealer
  deals for dummy, the player on the dealer's <i>left</i> must not look at
  his cards till either the dealer has declared trumps or, the declaration
  having been left to dummy, his own partner has led a card. The latter can
  double, but his partner can only double without seeing his hand. The
  dealer can only redouble on his own hand. When the player of dummy deals
  for himself, the player on his <i>right</i> hand looks at dummy's hand if
  the declaration is passed, the positions and restrictions of his partner
  and himself being reversed. If the player of dummy declares from his own
  hand, the game proceeds as in ordinary bridge, except that dummy's hand
  is not looked at till permission to play has been given. When the player
  on dummy's right deals, dummy's partner may look at dummy's hand to
  decide if he will double, but he may not look at his own till a card has
  been led by dummy. In another form of dummy bridge two hands are exposed
  whenever dummy's adversaries deal, but the game is unsuited for many
  players, as in every other hand the game is one of double-dummy.</p>

  <p><i>Misery Bridge.</i>&mdash;This is a form of bridge adapted for two
  players. The non-dealer has the dummy, whilst the dealer is allowed to
  strengthen his hand by discarding four or fewer cards and taking an equal
  number from the fourth packet dealt; the rest of the cards in that packet
  are unused and remain unseen. A novel and interesting addition to the
  game is that the three of clubs (called "Cato") does not rank as a club
  but can be played to any trick and win it. The dealer, in addition to his
  other calls, may declare "misery" when he has to make less than two
  tricks.</p>

  <p><i>Draw- or Two-handed Bridge.</i>&mdash;This is the best form of
  bridge for two players. Each player has a dummy, which is placed opposite
  to him; but the cards are so arranged that they cannot be seen by his
  opponent, a special stand being required for the purpose. The dealer
  makes the declaration or passes it to his dummy to make by the same rules
  as in three-handed or dummy bridge. The objection to this is that, since
  the opponent does not see the dealer's dummy, he has no chance of
  checking an erroneous declaration. This could be avoided by not allowing
  the dealer the option of passing.</p>

  <p><i>Auction Bridge.</i>&mdash;This variety of the game for four
  players, which adds an element characteristic of poker, appears to have
  been suggested about 1904, but was really introduced at the Bath Club,
  London, in 1907, and then was gradually taken up by a wider circle. The
  laws were settled in August 1908 by a joint committee of the Bath and
  Portland clubs. The scoring (except as below), value of suits, and play
  are as at ordinary bridge, but the variety consists in the method of
  declaration, the declaration not being confined in auction bridge to the
  dealer or his partner, and the deal being a disadvantage rather than
  otherwise. The dealer, having examined his hand, <i>must</i> declare to
  win at least one "odd" trick, and then each player in turn, beginning
  with the one on the dealer's left, has the right to pass the previous
  declaration, or double, or redouble, or overcall by making a declaration
  of higher value any number of times till all are satisfied, the actual
  play of the combined hands (or what in ordinary bridge would be dealer
  and dummy) resting eventually with the partners making the final
  declaration; the partner who made the first call (however small) in the
  suit finally constituting the trump (or no-trump) plays the hands, the
  other being dummy. A declaration of a greater number of tricks in a suit
  of lower value, which equals a previous call in value of points
  (<i>e.g.</i> two in spades as against one in clubs) is "of higher value";
  but doubling and redoubling only affect the score and not the
  declaration, so that a call of two diamonds overcalls one no-trump even
  though this has been doubled. The scoring in auction bridge has the
  additional element that when the eventual player of the two hands wins
  what was ultimately declared or more, his side score the full value below
  the line (as tricks), but if he fails the opponents score 50 points above
  the line (as honours) for each under-trick (<i>i.e.</i> trick short of
  the declaration), or 100 or 200 if doubled or redoubled, nothing being
  scored by either side below the line; the loss on a declaration of one
  spade is limited, however, to a maximum of 100 points. A player whose
  declaration has been doubled and who fulfils his contract, scores a bonus
  of 50 points above the line and a further 50 points for each additional
  trick beyond his declaration; if there was a redouble and he wins, he
  scores double the bonus. The penalty for a revoke (unaffected by a
  double) is (1) in the case of the declarer, that his adversaries add 150
  above the line; (2) in the case of one of his adversaries, that the
  declarer may either add 150 points above the line or may take three
  tricks from his opponents and add them to his own; in the latter case
  such tricks may assist him to fulfil his contract, but shall not entitle
  him to any bonus for a double or redouble. A revoking side may score
  nothing either above or below the line except for honours or chicane. As
  regards the essential feature of auction bridge, the competitive
  declaration, it is impossible here to discuss the intricacies involved.
  It entails, clearly, much reliance on a good partner, since the various
  rounds of bidding enable good players to draw inferences as to where the
  cards lie. The game opens the door to much larger scores than ordinary
  bridge, and since the end only comes from scores made below the line,
  there are obvious ways of prolonging it at the cost of scores above the
  line which involve much more of the gambling element. It by no means
  follows that the winner of the rubber is the winner by points, and many
  players prefer to go for points (<i>i.e.</i> above the line) extorted
  from their opponents rather than for fulfilling a declaration made by
  themselves.</p>

  of the 12th century, and maintained hospices at the chief fords of the
  principal rivers, besides building bridges and looking after ferries. The
  brotherhood was recognized by Pope Clement III. in 1189.</p>

  p.0532]</span>on one or both banks. As the process of moving an army over
  bridges is slow and complicated, it is usually necessary to secure it
  from hostile interruption, and the works constituting the bridge-head
  must therefore be sufficiently far advanced to keep the enemy's artillery
  out of range of the bridges. In addition, room is required for the troops
  to form up on the farther bank. In former days, with short-range weapons,
  a bridge-head was often little more than a screen for the bridge itself,
  but modern conditions have rendered necessary far greater extension of
  bridge defences.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGEND</b>, a market town in the southern parliamentary division
  of Glamorganshire, Wales, on both sides of the river Ogwr (whence its
  Welsh name Penybont-ar-Ogwr). Pop. of urban district (1901) 6062. It has
  a station 165 m. from London on the South Wales trunk line of the Great
  Western railway, and is the junction of the Barry Company's railway to
  Barry via Llantwit Major. Bridgend has a good market for agricultural
  produce, and is an important centre owing to its being the natural outlet
  for the mining valleys of the Llynvi, Garw and the two Ogwr rivers, which
  converge about 3 m. north of the town and are connected with it by branch
  lines of the Great Western railway. Though without large manufacturing
  industries, the town has joinery works, a brass and iron foundry, a
  tannery and brewery. There are brick-works and stone quarries, and much
  lime is burnt in the neighbourhood. Just outside the town at Angelton and
  Parc Gwyllt are the Glamorgan county lunatic asylums.</p>

  <p>There was no civil parish of Bridgend previous to 1905, when one was
  formed out of portions of the parishes of Newcastle and Coity. Of the
  castle of Newcastle, built on the edge of a cliff above the church of
  that parish, there remain a courtyard with flanking towers and a fine
  Norman gateway. At Coity, about 2 m. distant, there are more extensive
  ruins of its castle, originally the seat of the Turbervilles, lords of
  Coity, but now belonging to the earls of Dunraven. Coity church, dating
  from the 14th century, is a fine cruciform building with central
  embattled tower in Early Decorated style.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGE OF ALLAN</b>, a police burgh of Stirlingshire, Scotland.
  Pop. (1901) 3240. It lies on the Allan, a left-hand tributary of the
  Forth, 3 m. N. of Stirling by the Caledonian railway and by tramway.
  Built largely on the well-wooded slopes of Westerton and Airthrey Hill,
  sheltered by the Ochils from the north and east winds, and environed by
  charming scenery, it has a great reputation as a health resort and
  watering-place, especially in winter and spring. There is a pump-room.
  The chief buildings are the hydropathic and the Macfarlane museum of fine
  art and natural history. The industries include bleaching, dyeing and
  paper-making. The Strathallan Gathering, usually held in the
  neighbourhood, is the most popular athletic meeting in mid-Scotland.
  Airthrey Castle, standing in a fine park with a lake, adjoins the town on
  the south-east, and just beyond it are the old church and burying-ground
  of Logie, beautifully situated at the foot of a granite spur of the Ochil
  range.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGEPORT</b>, a city, a port of entry, and one of the
  county-seats of Fairfield county, Connecticut, U.S.A., co-extensive with
  the town of Bridgeport, in the S.W. part of the state, on Long Island
  Sound, at the mouth of the Pequonnock river; about 18 m. S.W. of New
  Haven. Pop. (1880) 27,643; (1890) 48,866; (1900) 70,996, of whom 22,281
  were foreign-born, including 5974 from Ireland, 3172 from Hungary, 2854
  from Germany, 2755 from England, and 1436 from Italy; (1910) 102,054.
  Bridgeport is served by the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford railway,
  by lines of coast steamers, and by steamers to New York City and to Port
  Jefferson, directly across Long Island Sound. The harbour, formed by the
  estuary of the river and Yellow Mill Pond, an inlet, is excellent.
  Between the estuary and the pond is a peninsula, East Bridgeport, in
  which are some of the largest manufacturing establishments, and west of
  the harbour and the river is the main portion of the city, the wholesale
  section extending along the bank, the retail section farther back, and
  numerous factories along the line of the railway far to the westward.
  There are two large parks, Beardsley, in the extreme north part of the
  city, and Seaside, west of the harbour entrance and along the Sound; in
  the latter are statues of Elias Howe, who built a large sewing-machine
  factory here in 1863, and of P.T. Barnum, the showman, who lived in
  Bridgeport after 1846 and did much for the city, especially for East
  Bridgeport. In Seaside Park there is also a soldiers' and sailors'
  monument, and in the vicinity are many fine residences. The principal
  buildings are the St Vincent's and Bridgeport hospitals, the Protestant
  orphan asylum, the Barnum Institute, occupied by the Bridgeport
  Scientific and Historical Society and the Bridgeport Medical Society; and
  the United States government building, which contains the post-office and
  the customs house.</p>

  <p>In 1905 Bridgeport was the principal manufacturing centre in
  Connecticut, the capital invested in manufacturing being $49,381,348, and
  the products being valued at $44,586,519. The largest industries were the
  manufacture of corsets&mdash;the product of Bridgeport was 19.9% of the
  total for the United States in 1905, Bridgeport being the leading city in
  this industry&mdash;sewing machines (one of the factories of the Singer
  Manufacturing Co. is here), steam-fitting and heating apparatus,
  cartridges (the factory of the Union Metallic Cartridge Co. is here),
  automobiles, brass goods, phonographs and gramophones, and typewriters.
  There are also large foundry and machine shops. Here, too, are the winter
  headquarters of "Barnum and Bailey's circus" and of "Buffalo Bill's Wild
  West Show." Bridgeport is a port of entry; its imports in 1908 were
  valued at $656,271. Bridgeport was originally a part of the township of
  Stratford. The first settlement here was made in 1659. It was called
  Pequonnock until 1695, when its name was changed to Stratfield. During
  the War of Independence it was a centre of privateering. In 1800 the
  borough of Bridgeport was chartered, and in 1821 the township was
  incorporated. The city was not chartered until 1836.</p>

  of Bridgeport</i> (New Haven, 1886).</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGES, ROBERT</b> (1844- ), English poet, born on the 23rd of
  October 1844, was educated at Eton and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
  and studied medicine in London at St Bartholomew's hospital. He was
  afterwards assistant physician at the Children's hospital, Great Ormond
  Street, and physician at the Great Northern hospital, retiring in 1882.
  Two years later he married Mary, daughter of Alfred Waterhouse, R.A. As a
  poet Robert Bridges stands rather apart from the current of modern
  English verse, but his work has had great influence in a select circle,
  by its restraint, purity, precision, and delicacy yet strength of
  expression; and it embodies a distinct theory of prosody. His chief
  critical works are <i>Milton's Prosody</i> (1893), a volume made up of
  two earlier essays (1887 and 1889), and <i>John Keats, a Critical
  Essay</i> (1895). He maintained that English prosody depended on the
  number of "stresses" in a line, not on the number of syllables, and that
  poetry should follow the rules of natural speech. His poetry was
  privately printed in the first instance, and was slow in making its way
  beyond a comparatively small circle of his admirers. His best work is to
  be found in his <i>Shorter Poems</i> (1890), and a complete edition of
  his <i>Poetical Works</i> (6 vols.) was published in 1898-1905. His chief
  volumes are <i>Prometheus</i> (Oxford, 1883, privately printed), a "mask
  in the Greek Manner"; <i>Eros and Psyche</i> (1885), a version of
  Apuleius; <i>The Growth of Love</i>, a series of sixty-nine sonnets
  printed for private circulation in 1876 and 1889; <i>Shorter Poems</i>
  (1890); <i>Nero</i> (1885), a historical tragedy, the second part of
  which appeared in 1894; <i>Achilles in Scyros</i> (1890), a drama;
  <i>Palicio</i> (1890), a romantic drama in the Elizabethan manner; <i>The
  Return of Ulysses</i> (1890), a drama in five acts; <i>The Christian
  Captives</i> (1890), a tragedy on the same subject as Calderon's <i>El
  Principe Constante</i>; <i>The Humours of the Court</i> (1893), a comedy
  founded on the same dramatist's <i>El secreto á voces</i> and on Lope de
  Vega's <i>El Perro del hortelano</i>; <i>The Feast of Bacchus</i> (1889),
  partly translated from the <i>Heauton-Timoroumenos</i> of Terence;
  <i>Hymns from the Yattendon Hymnal</i> (Oxford, 1899); and <i>Demeter, a
  Mask</i> (Oxford, 1905).</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGES.</b> 1. <i>Definitions and General
  Considerations.</i>&mdash;Bridges (old forms, <i>brig</i>, <i>brygge</i>,
  <i>brudge</i>; Dutch, <i>brug</i>; German, <i>Brücke</i>; a common
  Teutonic word) are structures carrying roadways, waterways or railways
  across streams, valleys or other roads or railways, leaving a passage way
  below. Long bridges of several spans are often termed "viaducts," and
  bridges carrying canals are termed "aqueducts," though this term is
  sometimes used for waterways which have no bridge structure. A "culvert"
  is a bridge of small span giving passage to drainage. In railway work an
  "overbridge" is a bridge over the railway, and an "underbridge" is a
  bridge carrying the railway. In all countries there are legal regulations
  fixing the minimum span and height of such bridges and the width of
  roadway to be provided. Ordinarily bridges are fixed bridges, but there
  are also movable bridges with machinery for opening a clear and
  unobstructed passage way for navigation. Most commonly these are "swing"
  or "turning" bridges. "Floating" bridges are roadways carried on pontoons
  moored in a stream.</p>

  <p>In classical and medieval times bridges were constructed of timber or
  masonry, and later of brick or concrete. Then late in the 18th century
  wrought iron began to be used, at first in combination with timber or
  cast iron. Cast iron was about the same time used for arches, and some of
  the early railway bridges were built with cast iron girders. Cast iron is
  now only used for arched bridges of moderate span. Wrought iron was used
  on a large scale in the suspension road bridges of the early part of the
  19th century. The great girder bridges over the Menai Strait and at
  Saltash near Plymouth, erected in the middle of the 19th century, were
  entirely of wrought iron, and subsequently wrought iron girder bridges
  were extensively used on railways. Since the introduction of mild steel
  of greater tenacity and toughness than wrought iron (<i>i.e.</i> from
  1880 onwards) it has wholly superseded the latter except for girders of
  less than 100 ft. span. The latest change in the material of bridges has
  been the introduction of ferro-concrete, armoured concrete, or concrete
  strengthened with steel bars for arched bridges. The present article
  relates chiefly to metallic bridges. It is only since metal has been used
  that the great spans of 500 to 1800 ft. now accomplished have been made
  possible.</p>

  <p>2. In a bridge there may be distinguished the <i>superstructure</i>
  and the <i>substructure</i>. In the former the main supporting member or
  members may be an arch ring or arched ribs, suspension chains or ropes,
  or a pair of girders, beams or trusses. The bridge flooring rests on the
  supporting members, and is of very various types according to the purpose
  of the bridge. There is also in large bridges wind-bracing to stiffen the
  structure against horizontal forces. The <i>substructure</i> consists of
  (<i>a</i>) the piers and end piers or abutments, the former sustaining a
  vertical load, and the latter having to resist, in addition, the oblique
  thrust of an arch, the pull of a suspension chain, or the thrust of an
  embankment; and (<i>b</i>) the foundations below the ground level, which
  are often difficult and costly parts of the structure, because the
  position of a bridge may be fixed by considerations which preclude the
  selection of a site naturally adapted for carrying a heavy structure.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Types of Bridges</i>.&mdash;Bridges may be classed as <i>arched
  bridges</i>, in which the principal members are in compression;
  <i>suspension bridges</i>, in which the principal members are in tension;
  and <i>girder bridges</i>, in which half the components of the principal
  members are in compression and half in tension. But there are cases of
  bridges of mixed type. The choice of the type to be adopted depends on
  many and complex considerations:&mdash;(1) The cost, having regard to the
  materials available. For moderate spans brick, masonry or concrete can be
  used without excessive cost, but for longer spans steel is more
  economical, and for very long spans its use is imperative. (2) The
  importance of securing permanence and small cost of maintenance and
  repairs has to be considered. Masonry and concrete are more durable than
  metal, and metal than timber. (3) Aesthetic considerations sometimes have
  great weight, especially in towns. Masonry bridges are preferable in
  appearance to any others, and metal arch bridges are less objectionable
  than most forms of girder.</p>

  <p>Most commonly the engineer has to attach great importance to the
  question of cost, and to design his structure to secure the greatest
  economy consistent with the provision of adequate strength. So long as
  bridge building was an empirical art, great waste of material was
  unavoidable. The development of the theory of structures has been largely
  directed to determining the arrangements of material which are most
  economical, especially in the superstructure. In the case of bridges of
  large span the cost and difficulty of erection are serious, and in such
  cases facility of erection becomes a governing consideration in the
  choice of the type to be adopted. In many cases the span is fixed by
  local conditions, such as the convenient sites for piers, or the
  requirements of waterway or navigation. But here also the question of
  economy must be taken into the reckoning. The cost of the superstructure
  increases very much as the span increases, but the greater the cost of
  the substructure, the larger the span which is economical. Broadly, the
  least costly arrangement is that in which the cost of the superstructure
  of a span is equal to that of a pier and foundation.</p>

  <p>For masonry, brick or concrete the arch subjected throughout to
  compression is the most natural form. The arch ring can be treated as a
  blockwork structure composed of rigid voussoirs. The stability of such
  structures depends on the position of the line of pressure in relation to
  the extrados and intrados of the arch ring. Generally the line of
  pressure lies within the middle half of the depth of the arch ring. In
  finding the line of pressure some principle such as the principle of
  least action must be used in determining the reactions at the crown and
  springings, and some assumptions must be made of not certain validity.
  Hence to give a margin of safety to cover contingencies not calculable,
  an excess of material must be provided. By the introduction of hinges the
  position of the line of resistance can be fixed and the stress in the
  arch ring determined with less uncertainty. In some recent masonry arched
  bridges of spans up to 150 ft. built with hinges considerable economy has
  been obtained.</p>

  <p>For an elastic arch of metal there is a more complete theory, but it
  is difficult of application, and there remains some uncertainty unless
  (as is now commonly done) hinges are introduced at the crown and
  springings.</p>

  <p>In suspension bridges the principal members are in tension, and the
  introduction of iron link chains about the end of the 18th century, and
  later of wire ropes of still greater tenacity, permitted the construction
  of road bridges of this type with spans at that time impossible with any
  other system of construction. The suspension bridge dispenses with the
  compression member required in girders and with a good deal of the
  stiffening required in metal arches. On the other hand, suspension
  bridges require lofty towers and massive anchorages. The defect of the
  suspension bridge is its flexibility. It can be stiffened by girders and
  bracing and is then of mixed type, when it loses much of its advantage in
  economy. Nevertheless, the stiffened suspension bridge will probably be
  the type adopted in future for very great spans. A bridge on this system
  has been projected at New York of 3200 ft. span.</p>

  <p>The immense extension of railways since 1830 has involved the
  construction of an enormous number of bridges, and most of these are
  girder bridges, in which about half the superstructure is in tension and
  half in compression. The use of wrought iron and later of mild steel has
  made the construction of such bridges very convenient and economical. So
  far as superstructure is concerned, more material must be used than for
  an arch or chain, for the girder is in a sense a combination of arch and
  chain. On the other hand, a girder imposes only a vertical load on its
  piers and abutments, and not a horizontal thrust, as in the case of an
  arch or suspension chain. It is also easier to erect.</p>

  <p>A fundamental difference in girder bridges arises from the mode of
  support. In the simplest case the main girders are supported at the ends
  only, and if there are several spans they are <i>discontinuous</i> or
  <i>independent</i>. But a main girder may be supported at two or more
  points so as to be <i>continuous</i> over two <!-- Page 534 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page534"></a>[v.04 p.0534]</span>or more spans.
  The continuity permits economy of weight. In a three-span bridge the
  theoretical advantage of continuity is about 49% for a dead load and 16%
  for a live load. The objection to continuity is that very small
  alterations of level of the supports due to settlement of the piers may
  very greatly alter the distribution of stress, and render the bridge
  unsafe. Hence many multiple-span bridges such as the Hawkesbury, Benares
  and Chittravatti bridges have been built with independent spans.</p>

  <p>Lastly, some bridges are composed of cantilevers and suspended
  girders. The main girder is then virtually a continuous girder hinged at
  the points of contrary flexure, so that no ambiguity can arise as to the
  stresses.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 1.&mdash;Trajan's Bridge.
  </div>
  <p>Whatever type of bridge is adopted, the engineer has to ascertain the
  loads to be carried, and to proportion the parts so that the stresses due
  to the loads do not exceed limits found by experience to be safe. In many
  countries the limits of working stress in public and railway bridges are
  prescribed by law. The development of theory has advanced <i>pari
  passu</i> with the demand for bridges of greater strength and span and of
  more complex design, and there is now little uncertainty in calculating
  the stresses in any of the types of structure now adopted. In the modern
  metal bridge every member has a definite function and is subjected to a
  calculated straining action. Theory has been the guide in the development
  of bridge design, and its trustworthiness is completely recognized. The
  margin of uncertainty which must be met by empirical allowances on the
  side of safety has been steadily diminished.</p>

  <p>The larger the bridge, the more important is economy of material, not
  only because the total expenditure is more serious, but because as the
  span increases the dead weight of the structure becomes a greater
  fraction of the whole load to be supported. In fact, as the span
  increases a point is reached at which the dead weight of the
  superstructure becomes so large that a limit is imposed to any further
  increase of span.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Roman Bridges</i>.&mdash;The first bridge known to have been
  constructed at Rome over the Tiber was the timber Pons Sublicius, the
  bridge defended by Horatius. The Pons Milvius, now Ponte Molle, was
  reconstructed in stone by M. Aemilius Scaurus in 109 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and some portions of the old bridge are
  believed to exist in the present structure. The arches vary from 51 to 79
  ft. span. The Pons Fabricius (mod. Ponte dei Quattro Capi), of about 62
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, is practically intact; and the Pons
  Cestius, built probably in 46 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, retains
  much of the original masonry. The Pons Aelius, built by Hadrian <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 134 and repaired by Pope Nicholas II. and
  Clement IX., is now the bridge of St Angelo. It had eight arches, the
  greatest span being 62 ft.<a name="FnAnchor_061"
  href="#Footnote_061"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Dio Cassius mentions a bridge,
  possibly 3000 to 4000 ft. in length, built by Trajan over the Danube in
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 104. Some piers are said still to exist. A
  bas-relief on the Trajan column shows this bridge with masonry piers and
  timber arches, but the representation is probably conventional (fig. 1).
  Trajan also constructed the bridge of Alcantara in Spain (fig. 2), of a
  total length of 670 ft., at 210 ft. above the stream. This had six arches
  and was built of stone blocks without cement. The bridge of Narses, built
  in the 6th century (fig. 3), carried the Via Salaria over the Anio. It
  was destroyed in 1867, during the approach of Garibaldi to Rome. It had a
  fortification such as became usual in later bridges for defence or for
  the enforcement of tolls. The great lines of aqueducts built by Roman
  engineers, and dating from 300 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> onwards,
  where they are carried above ground, are arched bridge structures of
  remarkable magnitude (see <span class="sc">Aqueducts</span>, §
  <i>Roman</i>). They are generally of brick and concrete.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Medieval and other Early Bridges</i>.&mdash;Bridges with stone
  piers and timber superstructures were no doubt constructed from Roman
  times onward, but they have perished. Fig. 4 shows a timber bridge
  erected by the brothers Grubenmann at Schaffhausen about the middle of
  the 18th century. It had spans of 172 and 193 ft., and may be taken as a
  representative type of bridges of this kind. The Wittingen bridge by the
  same engineers had a span of 390 ft., probably the longest timber <!--
  Page 535 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page535"></a>[v.04
  p.0535]</span>span ever constructed. Of stone bridges in Great Britain,
  the earliest were the cyclopean bridges still existing on Dartmoor,
  consisting of stone piers bridged by stone slabs. The bridge over the
  East Dart near Tavistock had three piers, with slabs 15 ft. by 6 ft.
  (Smiles, <i>Lives of the Engineers,</i> ii. 43). It is reputed to have
  lasted for 2000 years.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The curious bridge at Crowland near Peterborough (fig. 5) which now
  spans roadways, the streams which formerly flowed under it having been
  diverted, is one of the earliest known stone bridges in England. It is
  referred to in a charter of the year 943. It was probably built by the
  abbots. The first bridges over the Thames at London were no doubt of
  timber. William of Malmesbury mentions the existence of a bridge in 994.
  J. Stow (<i>Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster</i>) describes
  the building of the first stone bridge commonly called Old London Bridge:
  "About the year 1176, the stone bridge was begun to be founded by Peter
  of Colechurch, near unto the bridge of timber, but more towards the
  west." It carried timber houses (fig. 6) which were frequently burned
  down, yet the main structure existed till the beginning of the 19th
  century. The span of the arches ranged from 10 to 33 ft., and the total
  waterway was only 337 ft. The waterway of the present London Bridge is
  690 ft., and the removal of the obstruction caused by the old bridge
  caused a lowering of the low-water level by 5 ft., and a considerable
  deepening of the river-bed. (See Smiles, <i>Lives of the Engineers</i>,
  "Rennie.")</p>

  <p>The architects of the Renaissance showed great boldness in their
  designs. A granite arch built in 1377 over the Adda at Trezzo had a span
  at low water of 251 ft. This noble bridge was destroyed for military
  reasons by Carmagnola in 1416. The Rialto bridge at Venice, with a span
  of 91 ft., was built in 1588 by Antonio da Ponte. Fig. 7 shows the
  beautiful Ponte dellà Trinità erected at Florence in 1566 from the design
  of B. Ammanati.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Modern Bridges.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Timber.</i>&mdash;In
  England timber bridges of considerable span, either braced trusses or
  laminated arches (<i>i.e.</i> arches of planks bolted together), were
  built for some of the earlier railways, particularly the Great Western
  and the Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire. They have mostly been
  replaced, decay having taken place at the joints. Timber bridges of large
  span were constructed in America between the end of the 18th and the
  middle of the 19th century. The Amoskeag bridge over the Merrimac at
  Manchester, N.H., U.S.A., built in 1792, had 6 spans of 92 ft. The
  Bellows Falls bridge over the Connecticut (built 1785-1792) had 2 spans
  of 184 ft. The singular Colossus bridge, built in 1812 over the
  Schuylkill, a kind of flat arched truss, had a span of 340 ft. Some of
  these timber bridges are said to have lasted ninety years with ordinary
  repairs, but they were road bridges not heavily loaded. From 1840,
  trusses, chiefly of timber but with wrought-iron tension-rods and
  cast-iron shoes, were adopted in America. The Howe truss of 1830 and the
  Pratt truss of 1844 are examples. The Howe truss had timber chords and a
  lattice of timber struts, with vertical iron ties. In the Pratt truss the
  struts were vertical and the ties inclined. Down to 1850 such bridges
  were generally limited to 150 ft. span. The timber was white pine. As
  railway loads increased and greater spans were demanded, the Howe truss
  was stiffened by timber arches on each side of each girder. Such a
  composite structure is, however, fundamentally defective, the
  distribution of loading to the two independent systems being
  indeterminate. Remarkably high timber piers were built. The Genesee
  viaduct, 800 ft. in length, built in 1851-1852 in 10 spans, had timber
  trestle piers 190 ft. in height. (See Mosse, "American Timber Bridges,"
  <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> xxii. p. 305, and for more modern examples,
  cxlii. p. 409; and clv. p. 382; Cooper, "American Railroad Bridges,"
  <i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> vol. xxi pp. 1-28.) These timber framed
  structures served as models for the earlier metal trusses which began to
  be used soon after 1850, and which, except in a few localities where iron
  is costly, have quite superseded them.</p>

  <p>7. (<i>b</i>) <i>Masonry.</i>&mdash;The present London Bridge, begun
  in 1824 and completed in 1831, is as fine an example of a masonry arch
  structure as can be found (figs. 8 and 9). The design was made by John
  Rennie the elder, and the acting engineer was his son, Sir John Rennie.
  The semi-elliptical shape of the arches the variation of span, the slight
  curvature of the roadway, and the simple yet bold architectural details,
  combine to make it a singularly beautiful bridge. The centre arch has a
  span of 152 ft., and rises 29 ft. 6 in above Trinity high-water mark; the
  arches on each side of the centre have a span of 140 ft. and the abutment
  arches 130 ft. The total length of the bridge is 1005 ft., its width from
  outside to outside 56 ft., and height above low <!-- Page 536 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page536"></a>[v.04 p.0536]</span>water 60 ft.
  The two centre piers are 24 ft. thick, the exterior stones are granite,
  the interior, half Bramley Fall and half from Painshaw, Derbyshire. The
  voussoirs of the centre arch (all of granite) are 4 ft. 9 in. deep at the
  crown, and increase to not less than 9 ft. at the springing. The general
  depth at which the foundations are laid is about 29 ft. 6 in. below low
  water. The total cost was £1,458,311, but the contractor's tender for the
  bridge alone was £425,081.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;London New Bridge.
  </div>
  <p>Since 1867 it had been recognized that London Bridge was inadequate to
  carry the traffic passing over it, and a scheme for widening it was
  adopted in 1900. This was carried out in 1902-1904, the footways being
  carried on granite corbels, on which are mounted cornices and open
  parapets. The width between parapets is now 65 ft., giving a roadway of
  35 ft. and two footways of 15 ft. each. The architect was Andrew Murray
  and the engineer, G. E. W. Cruttwell. (Cole, <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>
  clxi. p. 290.)</p>

  <p>The largest masonry arch is the Adolphe bridge in Luxemburg, erected
  in 1900-1903. This has a span of 278 ft., 138 ft. rise above the river,
  and 102 ft. from foundation to crown. The thickness of the arch is 4 ft.
  8 in. at the crown and 7 ft. 2 in. where it joins the spandrel masonry.
  The roadway is 52 ft. 6 in. wide. The bridge is not continuous in width,
  there are arch rings on each face, each 16.4 ft. wide with a space
  between of 19.7 ft. This space is filled with a flooring of reinforced
  concrete, resting on the two arches, and carrying the central roadway. By
  the method adopted the total masonry has been reduced one-third. One
  centering was used for the two arch rings, supported on dwarf walls which
  formed a slipway, along which it was moved after the first was built.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Till near the end of the 19th century bridges of masonry or brickwork
  were so constructed that they had to be treated as rigid blockwork
  structures. The stability of such structures depends on the position of
  the line of pressure relatively to the intrados and extrados of the arch
  ring. Generally, so far as could be ascertained, the line of pressure
  lies within the middle half of the depth of the voussoirs. In finding the
  abutment reactions some principle such as the principle of least action
  must be used, and some assumptions of doubtful validity made. But if
  hinges are introduced at crown and springings, the calculation of the
  stresses in the arch ring becomes simple, as the line of pressures must
  pass through the hinges. Such hinges have been used not only for metal
  arches, but in a modified form for masonry and concrete arches. Three
  cases therefore arise: (<i>a</i>) The arch is rigid at crown and
  springings; (<i>b</i>) the arch is two-hinged (hinges at springings);
  (<i>c</i>) the arch is three-hinged (hinges at crown and springings). For
  an elementary account of the theory of arches, hinged or not, reference
  may be made to a paper by H. M. Martin (<i>Proc. Inst. C. E.</i> vol.
  xciii. p. 462); and for that of the elastic arch, to a paper by A.E.Young
  (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. cxxxi. p. 323).</p>

  <p>In Germany and America two- and three-hinged arches of masonry and
  concrete have been built, up to 150 ft. span, with much economy, and the
  calculations being simple, an engineer can venture to work closely to the
  dimensions required by theory. For hinges, Leibbrand, of Stuttgart, uses
  sheets of lead about 1 in. thick extending over the middle third of the
  depth of the voussoir joints, the rest of the joints being left open. As
  the lead is plastic this construction is virtually an articulation. If
  the pressure on the lead is uniformly varying, the centre of pressure
  must be within the middle third of the width of the lead; that is, it
  cannot deviate from the centre of the voussoir joint by more than
  one-eighteenth of its depth. In any case the position of the line of
  pressures is confined at the lead articulations within very narrow
  limits, and ambiguity as to the stresses is greatly diminished. The
  restricted area on which the pressure acts at the lead joints involves
  greater intensity of stress than has been usual in arched bridges. In the
  Württemberg hinged arches a limit of stress of 110 tons per sq. ft. was
  allowed, while in the unhinged arches at Cologne and Coblentz the limit
  was 50 to 60 tons per sq. ft. (<i>Annales des Fonts et Chaussées</i>,
  1891). At Rechtenstein a bridge of two concrete arches has been
  constructed, span 75½ ft., with lead articulations: width of arch 11 ft.;
  depth of arch at crown and springing 2.1 and 2.96 ft. respectively. The
  stresses were calculated to be 15, 17 and 12 tons per sq. ft. at crown,
  joint of rupture, and springing respectively. At Cincinnati a concrete
  arch of 70 ft. span has been built, with a rise of 10 ft. The concrete is
  reinforced by eleven 9-in. steel-rolled joists, spaced 3 ft. apart and
  supported by a cross-channel joist at each springing. The arch is 15 in.
  thick at the crown and 4 ft. at the abutments. The concrete consisted of
  1 cement, 2 sand and 3 to 4 broken stone. An important series of
  experiments on the strength of masonry, brick and concrete structures
  will be found in the <i>Zeitschr. des österreichen Ing. und Arch.
  Vereines</i> (1895).</p>

  <p>The thermal coefficient of expansion of steel and concrete is nearly
  the same, otherwise changes of temperature would cause shearing stress at
  the junction of the two materials. If the two materials are disposed
  symmetrically, the amount of load carried by each would be in direct
  proportion to the coefficient of elasticity and inversely as the moment
  of inertia of the cross section. But it is usual in many cases to provide
  a sufficient section of steel to carry all the tension. For concrete the
  coefficient of elasticity E varies with the amount of stress and
  diminishes as the ratio of sand and stone to cement increases. Its value
  is generally taken at 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 lb per sq. in. For steel E =
  28,000,000 to 30,000,000, or on the average about twelve times its value
  for concrete. The maximum compressive working stress on the concrete may
  be 500 lb per sq. in., the tensile working stress 50 lb per sq. in., and
  the working shearing stress 75 lb per sq. in. The tensile stress on the
  steel may be 16,000 lb per sq. in. The amount of steel in the structure
  may vary from 0.75 to 1.5%. The concrete not only affords much of the
  strength to resist compression, but effectively protects the steel from
  corrosion.</p>

  <p>8. (<i>c</i>) <i>Suspension Bridges.</i>&mdash;A suspension bridge
  consists of two or more chains, constructed of links connected by pins,
  or of twisted wire strands, or of wires laid parallel. The chains pass
  over lofty piers on which they usually rest on saddles carried by
  rollers, and are led down on either side to anchorages in rock chambers.
  A level platform is hung from the chains by suspension rods. In the
  suspension bridge iron or steel can be used in its strongest form, namely
  hard-drawn wire. Iron suspension bridges began to be used at the end of
  the 18th century for road bridges with spans unattainable at that time in
  any other system. In 1819 T. Telford began the construction of the Menai
  bridge (fig. 10), the span being 570 ft. and the dip 43 ft. This bridge
  suffered some injury in a storm, but it is still in good condition and
  one of the most graceful of bridges. Other bridges built soon after were
  the Fribourg bridge of 870 ft. span, the Hammersmith bridge of 422 ft.
  span, and the Pest bridge of 666 ft. span. The merit of the simple
  suspension bridge is its cheapness, and its defect is its flexibility.
  This last becomes less <!-- Page 537 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page537"></a>[v.04 p.0537]</span>serious as the dead weight of the
  structure becomes large in proportion to the live or temporary load. It
  is, therefore, a type specially suited for great spans. Some suspension
  bridges have broken down in consequence of the oscillations produced by
  bodies of men marching in step. In 1850 a suspension bridge at Angers
  gave way when 487 soldiers were marching over it, and 226 were
  killed.</p>

  </div>
  <p>To obtain greater stiffness various plans have been adopted. In the
  Ordish system a certain number of intermediate points in the span are
  supported by oblique chains, on which girders rest. The Ordish bridge
  built at Prague in 1868 had oblique chains supporting the stiffening
  girders at intermediate points of the span. A curved chain supported the
  oblique chains and kept them straight. In 1860 a bridge was erected over
  the Danube canal at Vienna, of 264 ft. span which had two parallel chains
  one above the other and 4 ft. apart on each side of the bridge. The
  chains of each pair were connected by bracing so that they formed a stiff
  inverted arch resisting deformation under unequal loading. The bridge
  carried a railway, but it proved weak owing to errors of calculation, and
  it was taken down in 1884. The principle was sound and has been proposed
  at various times. About 1850 it was perceived that a bridge stiff enough
  to carry railway trains could be constructed by combining supporting
  chains with stiffening girders suspended from them. W. J. M. Rankine
  proved (<i>Applied Mechanics</i>, p. 370) that the necessary strength of
  a stiffening girder would be only one-seventh part of that of an
  independent girder of the same span as the bridge, suited to carry the
  same moving load (not including the dead weight of the girder which is
  supported by the chain). (See "Suspension Bridge with Stiffened Roadway,"
  by Sir G. Airy, and the discussion, <i>Proc. Inst, C.E.</i>, 1867, xxvi.
  p. 258; also "Suspension Bridges with Stiffening Girders," by Max am
  Ende, <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> cxxxvii. p. 306.)</p>

  bridge built by J. A. Roebling in 1852-1855 (fig. 11). The span was 821
  ft., much the largest of any railway bridge at that time, and the height
  above the river 245 ft. There were four suspension cables, each 10 in. in
  diameter; each was composed of seven strands, containing 520 parallel
  wires, or 3640 wires in each cable. Each cable was carried on a separate
  saddle on rollers on each pier. The stiffening girder, constructed
  chiefly of timber, was a box-shaped braced girder 18 ft. deep and 25 ft.
  wide, carrying the railway on top and a roadway within. After various
  repairs and strengthenings, including the replacement of the timber
  girder by an iron one in 1880, this bridge in 1896-1897 was taken down
  and a steel arch built in its place. It was not strong enough to deal
  with the increasing weight of railway traffic. In 1836 I. K. Brunei
  constructed the towers and abutments for a suspension bridge of 702 ft.
  span at Clifton over the Avon, but the project was not then carried
  further; in 1860, however, the link chains of the Hungerford suspension
  bridge which was being taken down were available at small cost, and these
  were used to complete the bridge. There are three chains on each side, of
  one and two links alternately, and these support wrought iron stiffening
  girders. There are wrought iron saddles and steel rollers on the piers.
  At 196 ft. on either side from the towers the chains are carried over
  similar saddles without rollers, and thence at 45° with the horizontal
  down to the anchorages. Each chain has an anchor plate 5 ft. by 6 ft. The
  links are 24 ft. long at the centre of the bridge, and longer as they are
  more inclined, so that their horizontal projection is 24 ft. The chains
  are so arranged that there is a suspending rod at each 8 ft., attached at
  the joint of one of the three chains. For erection a suspended platform
  was constructed on eight wire ropes, on which the chains were laid out
  and connected. Another wire rope with a travelling carriage took out the
  links. The sectional area of the chains is 481 sq. in. at the piers and
  440 sq. in. at the centre. The two stiffening girders are plate girders 3
  ft. deep with flanges of 11 sq. in. area. In addition, the hand railing
  on each side forms a girder 4 ft. 9 in. deep, with flanges 4½ sq. in.
  area.</p>

  <p>Of later bridges of great span, perhaps the bridges over the East
  river at New York are the most remarkable. The Brooklyn bridge, begun in
  1872, has a centre span of 1595½ and side spans of 930 ft. The Brooklyn
  approach being 971 ft., and the New York approach 1562½ ft., the total
  length of the bridge is 5989 ft. There are four cables which carry a
  promenade, a roadway and an electric railway. The stiffening girders of
  the main span are 40 ft. deep and 67 ft. apart. The saddles for the
  chains are 329 ft. above high water. The cables are 15¾ in. in diameter.
  Each cable has 19 strands of 278 parallel steel wires, 7 B.W.G. Each wire
  is taken separately across the river and its length adjusted. Roebling
  preferred parallel wires as 10 % stronger than twisted wires. Each strand
  when made up and clamped was lowered to its position. The Williamsburg
  bridge (fig. 12), begun in 1897 and opened for traffic in 1903, has a
  span of 1600 ft., a versed sine of 176 ft., and a width of 118 ft. It has
  two decks, and carries two elevated railway tracks, four electric tramcar
  lines, two carriageways, two footways and two <!-- Page 538 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page538"></a>[v.04 p.0538]</span>bicycle paths.
  There are four cables, one on each side of the two main trusses or
  stiffening girders. These girders are supported by the cables over the
  centre span but not in the side spans. Intermediate piers support the
  trusses in the side spans. The cables are 18¾ in. in diameter; each
  weighs about 1116 tons, and has a nominal breaking strength of 22,320
  tons, the actual breaking strength being probably greater. The saddles
  are 332 ft. above the water. The four cables support a dead load of 7140
  tons and a live load of 4017 tons. Each cable is composed of 37 strands
  of 208 wires, or 7696 parallel steel wires, No. 8 B.W.G., or about 3/16
  in. in diameter. The wire was required to have a tensile strength of 89
  tons per sq. in., and 2½% elongation in 5 ft. and 5% in 8 in. Cast steel
  clamps hold the cable together, and to these the suspending rods are
  attached. The cables are wrapped in cotton duck soaked in oxidized oil
  and varnish, and are sheathed in sheet iron. A later bridge, the
  Manhattan, is designed to carry four railway tracks and four tramway
  lines, with a wide roadway and footpaths, supported by cables 21¼ in. in
  diameter, each composed of 9472 galvanized steel wires 3/16 in. in
  diameter.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;Tower Bridge, London.
  </div>
  <p>The Tower Bridge, London (fig. 13), is a suspension bridge with a
  secondary bascule bridge in the centre span to permit the passage of
  ships. Two main towers in the river and two towers on the shore abutments
  carry the suspension chains. The opening bridge between the river towers
  consists of two leaves or bascules, pivoted near the faces of the piers
  and rotating in a vertical plane. When raised, the width of 200 ft.
  between the main river piers is unobstructed up to the high-level
  foot-bridge, which is 141 ft. above Trinity H.W. The clear width of the
  two shore spans is 270 ft. The total length of the bridge is 940 ft., and
  that of the approaches 1260 ft. on the north and 780 ft. on the south.
  The width of the bridge between parapets is 60 ft., except across the
  centre span, where it is 49 ft. The main towers consist of a skeleton of
  steel, enclosed in a facing of granite and Portland stone, backed with
  brickwork. There are two high-level footways for use when the bascules
  are raised, the main girders of which are of the cantilever and suspended
  girder type. The cantilevers are fixed to the shore side of the towers.
  The middle girders are 120 ft. in length and attached to the cantilevers
  by links. The main suspension chains are carried across the centre span
  in the form of horizontal ties resting on the high-level footway girders.
  These ties are jointed to the hanging chains by pins 20 in. in diameter
  with a ring in halves surrounding it 5 in. thick. One half ring is
  rigidly attached to the tie and one to the hanging chain, so that the
  wear due to any movement is distributed over the length of the pin. A
  rocker bearing under these pins transmits the load at the joint to the
  steel columns of the towers. The abutment towers are similar to the river
  towers. On the abutment towers the chains are connected by horizontal
  links, carried on rockers, to anchor ties. The suspension chains are
  constructed in the form of braced girders, so that they are stiff against
  unsymmetrical loading. Each chain over a shore span consists of two
  segments, the longer attached to the tie at the top of the river tower,
  the shorter to the link at the top of the abutment tower, and the two
  jointed together at the lowest point. Transverse girders are hung from
  the chains at distances of 18 ft. There are fifteen main transverse
  girders to each shore span, with nine longitudinal girders between each
  pair. The trough flooring, &#x215C; in. thick and 6 in. deep, is riveted
  to the longitudinals. The anchor ties are connected to girders embedded
  in large concrete blocks in the foundations of the approach viaducts.</p>

  <p>The two bascules are each constructed with four main girders. Over the
  river these are lattice girders, with transverse girders 12 ft. apart,
  and longitudinal and subsidiary transverse girders dividing the floor
  into rectangles 3 ft. by 3½ ft. covered with buckled plates. The roadway
  is of pine blocks dowelled. The bascules rotate through an angle of 82°,
  and their rear ends in the bascule chambers of the piers carry 365 tons
  of counterweight, the total weight of each being 1070 tons. They rotate
  on steel shafts 21 in. in diameter and 48 ft. long, and the bascules can
  be lifted or lowered in one minute, but usually the time taken is one and
  a half minutes. They are worked by hydraulic machinery.</p>

  <p>9. (<i>d</i>) <i>Iron and Steel Girder Bridges.</i>&mdash;The main
  supporting members are two or more horizontal beams, girders or trusses.
  The girders carry a floor or platform either on top (<i>deck</i> bridges)
  or near the bottom (<i>through</i> bridges). The platform is variously
  constructed. For railway bridges it commonly consists of cross girders,
  attached to or resting on the main girders, and longitudinal rail girders
  or stringers carried by the cross girders and directly supporting the
  sleepers and rails. For spans over 75 ft., expansion due to change of
  temperature is provided for by carrying one end of each chain girder on
  rollers placed between the bearing-plate on the girder and the bed-plate
  on the pier or abutment.</p>

  <p>Fig. 14 shows the roller bed of a girder of the Kuilenburg bridge of
  490 ft. span. It will be seen that the girder directly rests on a
  cylindrical pin or rocker so placed as to distribute the load uniformly
  to all the rollers. The pressure on the rollers is limited to about
  <i>p</i> = 600 <i>d</i> in lb per in. length of roller, where <i>d</i> is
  the diameter of the roller in inches.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 14.&mdash;Roller Bed of a Girder.
  </div>
  <p>In the girders of bridges the horizontal girder is almost exclusively
  subjected to vertical loading forces. Investigation of the internal
  stresses, which balance the external forces, shows that most of the
  material should be arranged in a top flange, boom or chord, subjected to
  compression, and a bottom flange or chord, subjected to tension. (See
  <span class="sc">Strength of Materials</span>.) Connecting the flanges is
  a vertical web which may be a solid plate or a system of bracing bars. In
  any case, though the exact form of cross section of girders varies very
  much, it is virtually an I section (fig. 15). The function of the flanges
  is to resist a horizontal tension and compression distributed practically
  uniformly on their cross sections. The web resists forces equivalent <!--
  Page 539 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page539"></a>[v.04
  p.0539]</span>to a shear on vertical and horizontal planes. The inclined
  tensions and compressions in the bars of a braced web are equivalent to
  this shear. The horizontal stresses in the flanges are greatest at the
  centre of a span. The stresses in the web are greatest at the ends of the
  span. In the most numerous cases the flanges or chords are parallel. But
  girders may have curved chords and then the stresses in the web are
  diminished.</p>

  </div>
  <p>At first girders had solid or plate webs, but for spans over 100 ft.
  the web always now consists of bracing bars. In some girder bridges the
  members are connected entirely by riveting, in others the principal
  members are connected by pin joints. The pin system of connexion used in
  the Chepstow, Saltash, Newark Dyke and other early English bridges is now
  rarely used in Europe. But it is so commonly used in America as to be
  regarded as a distinctive American feature. With pin connexions some
  weight is saved in the girders, and erection is a little easier. In early
  pin bridges insufficient bearing area was allowed between the pins and
  parts connected, and they worked loose. In some cases riveted covers had
  to be substituted for the pins. The proportions are now better
  understood. Nevertheless the tendency is to use riveted connexions in
  preference to pins, and in any case to use pins for tension members
  only.</p>

  <p>On the first English railways cast iron girder bridges for spans of 20
  to 66 ft. were used, and in some cases these were trussed with wrought
  iron. When in 1845 the plans for carrying the Chester and Holyhead
  railway over the Menai Straits were considered, the conditions imposed by
  the admiralty in the interests of navigation involved the adoption of a
  new type of bridge. There was an idea of using suspension chains combined
  with a girder, and in fact the tower piers were built so as to
  accommodate chains. But the theory of such a combined structure could not
  be formulated at that time, and it was proved, partly by experiment, that
  a simple tubular girder of wrought iron was strong enough to carry the
  railway. The Britannia bridge (fig. 16) has two spans of 460 and two of
  230 ft. at 104 ft. above high water. It consists of a pair of tubular
  girders with solid or plate sides stiffened by angle irons, one line of
  rails passing through each tube. Each girder is 1511 ft. long and weighs
  4680 tons. In cross section (fig. 17), it is 15 ft. wide and varies in
  depth from 23 ft. at the ends to 30 ft. at the centre. Partly to
  counteract any tendency to buckling under compression and partly for
  convenience in assembling a great mass of plates, the top and bottom were
  made cellular, the cells being just large enough to permit passage for
  painting. The total area of the cellular top flange of the large-span
  girders is 648 sq. in., and of the bottom 585 sq. in. As no scaffolding
  could be used for the centre spans, the girders were built on shore,
  floated out and raised by hydraulic presses. The credit for the success
  of the Conway and Britannia bridges must be divided between the
  engineers. Robert Stephenson and William Fairbairn, and Eaton Hodgkinson,
  who assisted in the experimental tests and in formulating the imperfect
  theory then available. The Conway bridge was first completed, and the
  first train passed through the Britannia bridge in 1850. Though each
  girder has been made continuous over the four spans it has not quite the
  proportions over the piers which a continuous girder should have, and
  must be regarded as an imperfectly continuous girder. The spans were in
  fact designed as independent girders, the advantage of continuity being
  at that time imperfectly known. The vertical sides of the girders are
  stiffened so that they amount to 40% of the whole weight. This was partly
  necessary to meet the uncertain conditions in floating when the
  distribution of supporting forces was unknown and there were chances of
  distortion.</p>

  <p>Wrought iron and, later, steel plate web girders were largely used for
  railway bridges in England after the construction of the Conway and Menai
  bridges, and it was in the discussions arising during their design that
  the proper function of the vertical web between the top and bottom
  flanges of a girder first came to be understood. The proportion of depth
  to span in the Britannia bridge was 1/16. But so far as the flanges are
  concerned the stress <!-- Page 540 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page540"></a>[v.04 p.0540]</span>to be resisted varies inversely as
  the depth of the girder. It would be economical, therefore, to make the
  girder very deep. This, however, involves a much heavier web, and
  therefore for any type of girder there must be a ratio of depth to span
  which is most economical. In the case of the plate web there must be a
  considerable excess of material, partly to stiffen it against buckling
  and partly because an excess of thickness must be provided to reduce the
  effect of corrosion. It was soon found that with plate webs the ratio of
  depth to span could not be economically increased beyond 1/15 to 1/12. On
  the other hand a framed or braced web afforded opportunity for much
  better arrangement of material, and it very soon became apparent that
  open web or lattice or braced girders were more economical of material
  than solid web girders, except for small spans. In America such girders
  were used from the first and naturally followed the general design of the
  earlier timber bridges. Now plate web girders are only used for spans of
  less than 100 ft.</p>

  <p>Three types of bracing for the web very early developed&mdash;the
  Warren type in which the bracing bars form equilateral triangles, the
  Whipple Murphy in which the struts are vertical and the ties inclined,
  and the lattice in which both struts and ties are inclined at equal
  angles, usually 45° with the horizontal. The earliest published
  theoretical investigations of the stresses in bracing bars were perhaps
  those in the paper by W.T. Doyne and W.B. Blood (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>,
  1851, xi. p. 1), and the paper by J. Barton, "On the economic
  distribution of material in the sides of wrought iron beams" (<i>Proc.
  Inst. C.E.</i>, 1855, xiv. p. 443).</p>

  <p>The Boyne bridge, constructed by Barton in Ireland, in 1854-1855, was
  a remarkable example of the confidence with which engineers began to
  apply theory in design. It was a bridge for two lines of railway with
  lattice girders continuous over three spans. The centre span was 264 ft.,
  and the side spans 138 ft. 8 in.; depth 22 ft. 6 in. Not only were the
  bracing bars designed to calculated stresses, and the continuity of the
  girders taken into account, but the validity of the calculations was
  tested by a verification on the actual bridge of the position of the
  points of contrary flexure of the centre span. At the calculated position
  of one of the points of contrary flexure all the rivets of the top boom
  were cut out, and by lowering the end of the girder over the side span
  one inch, the joint was opened 1/32 in. Then the rivets were cut out
  similarly at the other point of contrary flexure and the joint opened.
  The girder held its position with both joints severed, proving that, as
  should be the case, there was no stress in the boom where the bending
  moment changes sign.</p>

  <p>By curving the top boom of a girder to form an arch and the bottom
  boom to form a suspension chain, the need of web except for non-uniform
  loading is obviated. I.K. Brunel adopted this principle for the Saltash
  bridge near Plymouth, built soon after the Britannia bridge. It has two
  spans of 455 ft. and seventeen smaller spans, the roadway being 100 ft.
  above high water. The top boom of each girder is an elliptical wrought
  iron tube 17 ft. wide by 12 ft. deep. The lower boom is a pair of chains,
  of wrought-iron links, 14 in each chain, of 7 in. by 1 in. section, the
  links being connected by pins. The suspending rods and cross bracing are
  very light. The depth of the girder at the centre is about one-eighth of
  the span.</p>

  <p>In both England and America in early braced bridges cast iron,
  generally in the form of tubes circular or octagonal in section, was used
  for compression members, and wrought iron for the tension members. Fig.
  19 shows the Newark Dyke bridge on the Great Northern railway over the
  Trent. It was a pin-jointed Warren girder bridge erected from designs by
  C.M. Wild in 1851-1853. The span between supports was 259 ft., the clear
  span 240½ ft.; depth between joint pins 16 ft. There were four girders,
  two to each line of way. The top flange consisted of cast iron hollow
  castings butted end to end, and the struts were of cast iron. The lower
  flange and ties were flat wrought iron links. This bridge has now been
  replaced by a stronger bridge to carry the greater loads imposed by
  modern traffic. Fig. 20 shows a Fink truss, a characteristic early
  American type, with cast iron compression and wrought iron tension
  members. The bridge is a deck bridge, the railway being carried on top.
  The transfer of the loads to the ends of the bridge by <!-- Page 541
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page541"></a>[v.04 p.0541]</span>long
  ties is uneconomical, and this type has disappeared. The Warren type,
  either with two sets of bracing bars or with intermediate verticals,
  affords convenient means of supporting the floor girders. In 1869 a
  bridge of 390 ft. span was built on this system at Louisville.</p>

  <p>Amongst remarkable American girder bridges may be mentioned the Ohio
  bridge on the Cincinnati &amp; Covington railway, which is probably the
  largest girder span constructed. The centre span is 550 ft. and the side
  spans 490 ft.&mdash;centre to centre of piers. The girders are
  independent polygonal girders. The centre girder has a length of 545 ft.
  and a depth of 84 ft. between pin centres. It is 67 ft. between parapets,
  and carries two lines of railway, two carriageways, and two footways. The
  cross girders, stringers and wind-bracing are wrought iron, the rest of
  mild steel. The bridge was constructed in 1888 by the Phoenix Bridge
  Company, and was erected on staging. The total weight of iron and steel
  in three spans was about 5000 tons.</p>

  <p>10. (<i>e</i>) <i>Cantilever Bridges.</i>&mdash;It has been stated
  that if in a girder bridge of three or more spans, the girders were made
  continuous there would be an important economy of material, but that the
  danger of settlement of the supports, which would seriously alter the
  points of contrary flexure or points where the bending moment changes
  sign, and therefore the magnitude and distribution of the stresses,
  generally prevents the adoption of continuity. If, however, hinges or
  joints are introduced at the points of contrary flexure, they become
  necessarily points where the bending moment is zero and ambiguity as to
  the stresses vanishes. The exceptional local conditions at the site of
  the Forth bridge led to the adoption there of the cantilever system, till
  then little considered. Now it is well understood that in many positions
  this system is the simplest and most economical method of bridging. It is
  available for spans greater than those practicable with independent
  girders; in fact, on this system the spans are virtually reduced to
  smaller spans so far as the stresses are concerned. There is another
  advantage which in many cases is of the highest importance. The
  cantilevers can be built out from the piers, member by member, without
  any temporary scaffolding below, so that navigation is not interrupted,
  the cost of scaffolding is saved, and the difficulty of building in deep
  water is obviated. The centre girder may be built on the cantilevers and
  rolled into place or lifted from the water-level. Fig. 21 shows a typical
  cantilever bridge of American design. In this case the shore ends of the
  cantilevers are anchored to the abutments. J.A.L. Waddell has shown that,
  in some cases, it is convenient to erect simple independent spans, by
  building them out as cantilevers and converting them into independent
  girders after erection. Fig. 22 shows girders erected in this way, the
  dotted lines being temporary members during erection, which are removed
  afterwards. The side spans are erected first on staging and anchored to
  the piers. From these, by the aid of the temporary members, the centre
  span is built out from both sides. The most important cantilever bridges
  so far erected or projected are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  stiffened suspension bridge, but after the fall of the Tay bridge in 1879
  this was abandoned. The bridge, which was begun in 1882 and completed in
  1889, is at the only narrowing of the Forth in a distance of 50 m., at a
  point where the channel, about a mile in width, is divided by the island
  of Inchgarvie. The length of the cantilever bridge is 5330 ft., made up
  thus: central tower on Inchgarvie 260 ft.; Fife and Queensferry piers
  each 145 ft.; two central girders between cantilevers each 350 ft.; and
  six cantilevers each 680 ft. The two main spans are each 1710 ft. The
  clear headway is 157 ft., and the extreme height of the towers above high
  water 361 ft. The outer ends of the shore cantilevers are loaded to
  balance half the weight of the central girder, the rolling load, and 200
  tons in addition. An internal viaduct of lattice girders carries a double
  line of rails. Provision is made for longitudinal expansion due to change
  of temperature, for distortion due to the sun acting on one side of the
  structure, and for the wind acting on one side of the bridge. The amount
  of steel used was 38,000 tons exclusive of approach viaducts. (See <i>The
  Forth Bridge</i>, by W. Westhofen; <i>Reports of the British
  Association</i> (1884 and 1885); <i>Die Forth Brücke</i>, von G.

  <p>(3) The Lansdowne bridge (completed 1889) at Sukkur, over the Indus.
  The clear span is 790 ft., and the suspended girder 200 ft. in length.
  The span to the centres of the end uprights is 820 ft.; width between
  centres of main uprights at bed-plate 100 ft., and between centres of
  main members at end of <span class="correction" title="'centilevers' in original"
  >cantilevers</span> 20 ft. The bridge is for a single line of railway of
  5 ft. 6 in. gauge. The back guys are the most heavily strained part of
  the structure, the stress provided for being 1200 tons. This is due to
  the half weight of centre girder, the weight of the cantilever itself,
  the rolling load on half the bridge, and the wind pressure. The anchors
  are built up of steel plates and angle, bars, and are buried in a large
  mass of concrete. The area of each anchor plate, normal to the line of
  stress, is 32 ft. by 12 ft. The bridge was designed by Sir A. Rendel, the
  consulting engineer to the Indian government (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>
  ciii. p. 123).</p>

  shore piers carry cantilevers projecting one way over the river openings
  and the other way over a shore span where it is secured to an anchorage.
  The girder spans are 525 ft., the cantilever spans 547 ft., and the shore
  spans 201 ft.</p>

  <p>11. (<i>f</i>) <i>Metal Arch Bridges.</i>&mdash;The first iron bridge
  erected was constructed by John Wilkinson (1728-1808) and Abraham Darby
  (1750-1791) in 1773-1779 at Coalbrookdale over the Severn (fig. 27). It
  had five cast iron arched ribs with a centre span of 100 ft. This curious
  bridge is still in use. Sir B. Baker stated that it had required patching
  for ninety years, because the arch and the high side arches would not
  work together. Expansion and contraction broke the high arch and the
  connexions between the arches. When it broke they fished it. Then the
  bolts sheared or the ironwork broke in a new place. He advised that there
  was nothing unsafe; it was perfectly strong and the stress in vital parts
  moderate. All that needed to be done was to fish the fractured ribs of
  the high arches, put oval holes in the fishes, and not screw up the bolts
  too tight.</p>

  <p>Cast iron arches of considerable span were constructed late in the
  18th and early in the 19th century. The difficulty of casting heavy arch
  ribs led to the construction of cast iron arches of cast voussoirs,
  somewhat like the voussoirs of masonry bridges. Such a bridge was the
  Wearmouth bridge, designed by Rowland Burdon and erected in 1793-1796,
  with a span of 235 ft. Southwark bridge over the Thames, designed by John
  Rennie with cast iron ribs and erected in 1814-1819, has a centre span of
  240 ft. and a rise of 24 ft. In Paris the Austerlitz (1800-1806) and
  Carrousel (1834-1836) bridges had cast iron arches. In 1858 an aqueduct
  bridge was erected at Washington by M.C. Meigs (1816-1892). This had two
  arched ribs formed by the cast iron pipes through which the water passed.
  The pipes were 4 ft. in diameter inside, 1½ in. thick, and were lined
  with staves of pine 3 in. thick to prevent freezing. The span was 200
  ft.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 29.&mdash;St Louis Bridge.
  </div>
  <p>Of large-span bridges with steel arches, one of the most important is
  the St Louis bridge over the Mississippi, completed in 1874 (fig. 29).
  The river at St Louis is confined to a single channel, 1600 ft. wide, and
  in a freshet in 1870 the scour reached a depth of 51 ft. Captain J.B.
  Eads, the engineer, determined to establish the piers and abutments on
  rock at a depth for the east pier and east abutment of 136 ft. below high
  water. This was effected by caissons with air chambers and air locks, a
  feat unprecedented in the annals of engineering. The bridge has three
  spans, each formed of arches of cast steel. The centre span is 520 ft.
  and the side spans 502 ft. in the clear. The rise of the centre arch is
  47½ ft., and that of the side arches 46 ft. Each span has four steel
  double ribs of steel tubes butted and clasped by wrought iron couplings.
  The vertical bracing between the upper and lower members of each rib,
  which are 12 ft. apart, centre to centre, consolidates them into a single
  arch. The arches carry a double railway track and above this a roadway 54
  ft. wide.</p>

  <p>The St Louis bridge is not hinged, but later bridges have been
  constructed with hinges at the springings and sometimes with hinges at
  the crown also.</p>

  <p>The Alexander III. bridge over the Seine has fifteen steel ribs hinged
  at crown and springings with a span of 353 ft. between centres of hinges
  and 358 ft. between abutments. The rise from side to centre hinges is 20
  ft. 7 in. The roadway is 65½ ft. wide and footways 33 ft. (<i>Proc. Inst.
  C.E.</i> cxxx. p. 335).</p>

  </div>
  <p>The largest three-hinged-arch bridge constructed is the Viaur viaduct
  in the south of France (fig. 30). The central span is 721 ft. 9 in. and
  the height of the rails above the valley 380 ft. It has a very fine
  appearance, especially when seen in perspective and not merely in
  elevation.</p>

  <p>Fig. 31 shows the Douro viaduct of a total length of 1158 ft. carrying
  a railway 200 ft. above the water. The span of the central opening is 525
  ft. The principal rib is crescent-shaped 32.8 ft. deep <!-- Page 543
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page543"></a>[v.04 p.0543]</span>at the
  crown. Rolling load taken at 1.2 ton per ft. Weight of centre span 727
  tons. The Luiz I. bridge is another arched bridge over the Douro, also
  designed by T. Seyrig. This has a span of 566 ft. There are an upper and
  lower roadway, 164 ft. apart vertically. The arch rests on rollers and is
  narrowest at the crown. The reason given for this change of form was that
  it more conveniently allowed the lower road to pass between the
  springings and ensured the transmission of the wind stresses to the
  abutments without interrupting the cross-bracing. Wire cables were used
  in the erection, by which the members were lifted from barges and
  assembled, the operations being conducted from the side piers.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 32.&mdash;Niagara Falls and Clifton
    Bridge.
  </div>
  <p>The Niagara Falls and Clifton steel arch (fig. 32) replaces the older
  Roebling suspension bridge. The centre span is a two-hinged parabolic
  braced rib arch, and there are side spans of 190 and 210 ft. The bridge
  carries two electric-car tracks, two roadways and two footways. The main
  span weighed 1629 tons, the side spans 154 and 166 tons (Buck, <i>Proc.
  Inst. C.E.</i> cxliv. p. 70). Prof. Claxton Fidler, speaking of the
  arrangement adopted for putting initial stress on the top chord, stated
  that this bridge marked the furthest advance yet made in this type of
  construction. When such a rib is erected on centering without initial
  stress, the subsequent compression of the arch under its weight inflicts
  a bending stress and excess of compression in the upper member at the
  crown. But the bold expedients adopted by the engineer annulled the
  bending action.</p>

  <p>The Garabit viaduct carries the railway near St Flour, in the Cantal
  department, France, at 420 ft. above low water. The deepest part of the
  valley is crossed by an arch of 541 ft. span, and 213 ft. rise. The
  bridge is similar to that at Oporto, also designed by Seyrig. It is
  formed by a crescent-shaped arch, continued on one side by four, on the
  other side by two lattice girder spans, on iron piers. The arch is formed
  by two lattice ribs hinged at the abutments. Its depth at the crown is 33
  ft., and its centre line follows nearly the parabolic line of pressures.
  The two arch ribs are 65½ ft. apart at the springings and 20½ ft. at the
  crown. The roadway girders are lattice, 17 ft. deep, supported from the
  arch ribs at four points. The total length of the viaduct is 1715 ft. The
  lattice girders of the side spans were first rolled into place, so as to
  project some distance beyond the piers, and then the arch ribs were built
  out, being partly supported by wire-rope cables from the lattice girders
  above. The total weight of ironwork was 3200 tons and the cost £124,000
  (<i>Annales des travaux publiques</i>, 1884).</p>

  <p>The Victoria Falls bridge over the Zambezi, designed by Sir Douglas
  Fox, and completed in 1905, is a combination of girder and arch having a
  total length of 650 ft. The centre arch is 500 ft. span, the rise of the
  crown 90 ft., and depth at crown 15 ft. The width between centres of ribs
  of main arch is 27½ ft. at crown and 53 ft. 9 in at springings. The curve
  of the main arch is a parabola. The bridge has a roadway of 30 ft. for
  two lines of rails. Each half arch was supported by cables till joined at
  the centre. An electric cableway of 900 ft. span capable of carrying 10
  tons was used in erection.</p>

  <p>12. (g) <i>Movable Bridges</i> can be closed to carry a road or
  railway or in some cases an aqueduct, but can be opened to give free
  passage to navigation. They are of several types:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:32%;">
      <a href="images/bridges_33.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/bridges_33.png"
      alt="Fig. 33.--Moving bridges." title="Fig. 33.--Moving bridges." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 33.
  </div>
  <p>(1) <i>Lifting Bridges.</i>&mdash;The bridge with its platform is
  suspended from girders above by chains and counterweights at the four
  corners (fig. 33 a). It is lifted vertically to the required height when
  opened. Bridges of this type are not very numerous or important.</p>

  <p>(2) <i>Rolling Bridges.</i>&mdash;The girders are longer than the span
  and the part overhanging the abutment is counter-weighted so that the
  centre of gravity is over the abutment when the bridge is rolled forward
  (fig. 33 b). To fill the gap in the approaches when the bridge is rolled
  forward a frame carrying that part of the road is moved into place
  sideways. At Sunderland, the bridge is first lifted by a hydraulic press
  so as to clear the roadway behind, and is then rolled back.</p>

  <p>(3) <i>Draw or Bascule Bridges.</i>&mdash;The fortress draw-bridge is
  the original type, in which a single leaf, or bascule, turns round a
  horizontal hinge at one abutment. The bridge when closed is supported on
  abutments at each end. It is raised by chains and counterweights. A more
  common type is a bridge with two leaves or bascules, one hinged at each
  abutment. When closed <!-- Page 544 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page544"></a>[v.04 p.0544]</span>the bascules are locked at the
  centre (see fig. 13). In these bridges each bascule is prolonged
  backwards beyond the hinge so as to balance at the hinge, the
  prolongation sinking into the piers when the bridge is opened.</p>

  <p>(4) <i>Swing or Turning Bridges.</i>&mdash;The largest movable bridges
  revolve about a vertical axis. The bridge is carried on a circular base
  plate with a central pivot and a circular track for a live ring and
  conical rollers. A circular revolving platform rests on the pivot and
  rollers. A toothed arc fixed to the revolving platform or to the live
  ring serves to give motion to the bridge. The main girders rest on the
  revolving platform, and the ends of the bridge are circular arcs fitting
  the fixed roadway. Three arrangements are found: (a) the axis of rotation
  is on a pier at the centre of the river and the bridge is equal armed
  (fig. 33 c), so that two navigation passages are opened simultaneously.
  (b) The axis of rotation is on one abutment, and the bridge is then
  usually unequal armed (fig. 33 d), the shorter arm being over the land.
  (c) In some small bridges the shorter arm is vertical and the bridge
  turns on a kind of vertical crane post at the abutment (fig. 33 e).</p>

  <p>(5) <i>Floating Bridges</i>, the roadway being carried on pontoons
  moored in the stream.</p>

  <p>The movable bridge in its closed position must be proportioned like a
  fixed bridge, but it has also other conditions to fulfil. If it revolves
  about a vertical axis its centre of gravity must always lie in that axis;
  if it rolls the centre of gravity must always lie over the abutment. It
  must have strength to support safely its own overhanging weight when
  moving.</p>

  <p>At Konigsberg there is a road bridge of two fixed spans of 39 ft., and
  a central span of 60 ft. between bearings, or 41 ft. clear, with balanced
  bascules over the centre span. Each bascule consists of two main girders
  with cross girders and stringers. The main girders are hung at each side
  on a horizontal shaft 8&#x215D; in. in diameter, and are 6 ft. deep at
  the hinge, diminishing to 1 ft. 7 in. at the centre of the span. The
  counterweight is a depressed cantilever arm 12 ft. long, overlapped by
  the fixed platform which sinks into a recess in the masonry when the
  bridge opens. In closed position the main girders rest on a bed plate on
  the face of the pier 4 ft. 3 in. beyond the shaft bearings. The bridge is
  worked by hydraulic power, an accumulator with a load of 34 tons
  supplying pressure water at 630 lb per sq. in. The bridge opens in 15
  seconds and closes in 25 seconds.</p>

  <p>At the opening span of the Tower bridge (fig. 13) there are four main
  girders in each bascule. They project 100 ft. beyond and 62 ft. 6 in.
  within the face of the piers. Transverse girders and bracings are
  inserted between the main girders at 12 ft. intervals. The floor is of
  buckled plates paved with wood blocks. The arc of rotation is 82°, and
  the axis of rotation is 13 ft. 3 in. inside the face of the piers, and 5
  ft. 7 in. below the roadway. The weight of ballast in the short arms of
  the bascules is 365 tons. The weight of each leaf including ballast is
  about 1070 tons. The axis is of forged steel 21 in. in diameter and 48
  ft. long. The axis has eight bearings, consisting of rings of live
  rollers 4-7/16 in. in diameter and 22 in. long. The bascules are rotated
  by pinions driven by hydraulic engines working in steel sectors 42 ft.
  radius (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> cxxvii. p. 35).</p>

  <p>As an example of a swing bridge, that between Duluth and Superior at
  the head of Lake Superior over the St Louis river may be described. The
  centre opening is 500 ft., spanned by a turning bridge, 58 ft. wide. The
  girders weighing 2000 tons carry a double track for trains between the
  girders and on each side on cantilevers a trolley track, roadway and
  footway. The bridge can be opened in 2 minutes, and is operated by two
  large electric motors. These have a speed reduction from armature shaft
  to bridge column of 1500 to 1, through four intermediate spur gears and a
  worm gear. The end lifts which transfer the weight of the bridge to the
  piers when the span is closed consist of massive eccentrics having a
  throw of 4 in. The clearance is 2 in., so that the ends are lifted 2 in.
  This gives a load of 50 tons per eccentric. One motor is placed at each
  end of the span to operate the eccentrics and also to release the latches
  and raise the rails of the steam track.</p>

  <p>At Riga there is a floating pontoon bridge over the Duna. It consists
  of fourteen rafts, 105 ft. in length, each supported by two pontoons
  placed 64 ft. apart. The pairs of rafts are joined by three baulks 15 ft.
  long laid in parallel grooves in the framing. Two spans are arranged for
  opening easily. The total length is 1720 ft. and the width 46 ft. The
  pontoons are of iron, 85½ ft. in length, and their section is elliptical,
  10½ ft. horizontal and 12 ft. vertical. The displacement of each pontoon
  is 180 tons and its weight 22 tons. The mooring chains, weighing 22 lb
  per ft., are taken from the upstream end of each pontoon to a downstream
  screw pile mooring and from the downstream end to an upstream screw
  pile.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Transporter Bridges.</i>&mdash;This new type of bridge consists
  of a high level bridge from which is suspended a car at a low level. The
  car receives the traffic and conveys it across the river, being caused to
  travel by electric machinery on the high level bridge. Bridges of this
  type have been erected at Portugalete, Bizerta, Rouen, Rochefort and more
  recently across the Mersey between the towns of Widnes and Runcorn.</p>

    Bridge.
  </div>
  <p>The Runcorn bridge crosses the Manchester Ship Canal and the Mersey in
  one span of 1000 ft., and four approach spans of 55½ ft. on one side and
  one span on the other. The low-level approach roadways are 35 ft. wide
  with footpaths 6 ft. wide on each side. The supporting structure is a
  cable suspension bridge with stiffening girders. A car is suspended from
  the bridge, carried by a trolley running on the underside of the
  stiffening girders, the car being <!-- Page 545 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page545"></a>[v.04 p.0545]</span>propelled
  electrically from one side to the other. The underside of the stiffening
  girder is 82 ft. above the river. The car is 55 ft. long by 24½ ft. wide.
  The electric motors are under the control of the driver in a cabin on the
  car. The trolley is an articulated frame 77 ft. long in five sections
  coupled together with pins. To this are fixed the bearings of the running
  wheels, fourteen on each side. There are two steel-clad series-wound
  motors of 36 B.H.P. For a test load of 120 tons the tractive force is 70
  lb per ton, which is sufficient for acceleration, and maintaining speed
  against wind pressure. The brakes are magnetic, with auxiliary
  handbrakes. Electricity is obtained by two gas engines (one spare) each
  of 75 B.H.P.</p>

  <p>On the opening day passengers were taken across at the rate of more
  than 2000 per hour in addition to a number of vehicles. The time of
  crossing is 3 or 4 minutes. The total cost of the structure was
  £133,000.</p>

  <p>14. In the United States few railway companies design or build their
  own bridges. General specifications as to span, loading, &amp;c., are
  furnished to bridge-building companies, which make the design under the
  direction of engineers who are experts in this kind of work. The design,
  with strain sheets and detail drawings, is submitted to the railway
  engineer with estimates. The result is that American bridges are
  generally of well-settled types and their members of uniform design,
  carefully considered with reference to convenient and accurate
  manufacture. Standard patterns of details are largely adopted, and more
  system is introduced in the workshop than is possible where the designs
  are more varied. Riveted plate girders are used up to 50 ft. span,
  riveted braced girders for spans of 50 ft. to 75 ft., and pin-connected
  girders for longer spans. Since the erection of the Forth bridge,
  cantilever bridges have been extensively used, and some remarkable steel
  arch and suspension bridges have also been constructed. Overhead railways
  are virtually continuous bridge constructions, and much attention has
  been given to a study of the special conditions appertaining to that
  case.</p>

<h4><i>Substructure.</i></h4>

  <p>15. The substructure of a bridge comprises the piers, abutments and
  foundations. These portions usually consist of masonry in some form,
  including under that general head stone masonry, brickwork and concrete.
  Occasionally metal work or woodwork is used for intermediate piers.</p>

  <p>When girders form the superstructure, the resultant pressure on the
  piers or abutments is vertical, and the dimensions of these are simply
  regulated by the sufficiency to bear this vertical load.</p>

  <p>When arches form the superstructure, the abutment must be so designed
  as to transmit the resultant thrust to the foundation in a safe
  direction, and so distributed that no part may be unduly compressed. The
  intermediate piers should also have considerable stability, so as to
  counterbalance the thrust arising when one arch is loaded while the other
  is free from load.</p>

  <p>For suspension bridges the abutment forming the anchorage must be so
  designed as to be thoroughly stable under the greatest pull which the
  chains can exert. The piers require to be carried above the platform, and
  their design must be modified according to the type of suspension bridge
  adopted. When the resultant pressure is not vertical on the piers these
  must be constructed to meet the inclined pressure. In any stiffened
  suspension bridge the action of the pier will be analogous to that of a
  pier between two arches.</p>

  <p><i>Concrete in a shell</i> is a name which might be applied to all the
  methods of founding a pier which depend on the very valuable property
  which strong hydraulic concrete possesses of setting into a solid mass
  under water. The required space is enclosed by a wooden or iron shell;
  the soil inside the shell is removed by dredging, or some form of
  mechanical excavator, until the formation is reached which is to support
  the pier; the concrete is then shot into the enclosed space from a height
  of about 10 ft., and rammed down in layers about 1 ft. thick; it soon
  consolidates into a permanent artificial stone.</p>

  <p><i>Piles</i> are used as foundations in compressible or loose soil.
  The heads of the piles are sawn off, and a platform of timber or concrete
  rests on them. Cast iron and concrete reinforced piles are now used.
  <i>Screw piles</i> are cast iron piles which are screwed into the soil
  instead of being driven in. At their end is fixed a blade of cast iron
  from two to eight times the diameter of the shaft of the pile; the pitch
  of the screw varies from one-half to one-fourth of the external diameter
  of the blade.</p>

  <p><i>Disk piles</i> have been used in sand. These piles have a flat
  flange at the bottom, and water is pumped in at the top of the pile,
  which is weighted to prevent it from rising. Sand is thus blown or pumped
  from below the piles, which are thus easily lowered in ground which
  baffles all attempts to drive in piles by blows. In ground which is of
  the nature of quicksand, piles will often slowly rise to their original
  position after each blow.</p>

  <p><i>Wells.</i>&mdash;In some soils foundations may be obtained by the
  device of building a masonry casing like that of a well and excavating
  the soil inside; the casing gradually sinks and the masonry is continued
  at the surface. This method is applicable in running sands. The interior
  of the well is generally filled up with concrete or brick when the
  required depth has been reached.</p>

  <p><i>Piers and Abutments.</i>&mdash;Piers and abutments are of masonry,
  brickwork, or cast or wrought iron. In the last case they consist of any
  number of hollow cylindrical pillars, vertical or raking, turned and
  planed at the ends and united by a projection or socket and by flanges
  and bolts. The pillars are strengthened against lateral yielding by
  horizontal and diagonal bracing. In some cases the piers are cast iron
  cylinders 10 ft. or more in diameter filled with concrete.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;Cylinder, Charing Cross Bridge.
  </div>
  <p><i>Cylinder Foundations.</i>&mdash;Formerly when bridge piers had to
  be placed where a firm bearing stratum could only be reached at a
  considerable depth, a timber cofferdam was used in which piles were
  driven down to the firm stratum. On the piles the masonry piers were
  built. Many bridges so constructed have stood for centuries. A great
  change of method arose when iron cylinders and in some cases brick
  cylinders or wells were adopted for foundations. These can be sunk to
  almost any depth or brought up to any height, and are filled with
  Portland cement concrete. They are sometimes excavated by grabs.
  Sometimes they are closed in and kept free of water by compressed air so
  that excavation work can be carried on inside them (fig. 35). Sometimes
  in silty river beds they are sunk 100 ft. or more, for <!-- Page 546
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page546"></a>[v.04
  p.0546]</span>security against deep scouring of the river-bed in floods.
  In the case of the Empress bridge over the Sutlej each pier consisted of
  three brick wells, 19 ft. in diameter, sunk 110 ft. The piers of the
  Benares bridge were single iron caissons, 65 ft. by 28 ft., sunk about
  100 ft., lined with brick and filled with concrete. At the Forth bridge
  iron caissons 70 ft. in diameter were sunk about 40 ft. into the bed of
  the Forth. In this case the compressed air process was used.</p>

  <p>16. <i>Erection.</i>&mdash;Consideration of the local conditions
  affecting the erection of bridges is always important, and sometimes
  becomes a controlling factor in the determination of the design. The
  methods of erection may be classed as&mdash;(1) erection on staging or
  falsework; (2) floating to the site and raising; (3) rolling out from one
  abutment; (4) building out member by member, the completed part forming
  the stage from which additions are handled.</p>

  <p>(1) In erection on staging, the materials available determine the
  character of the staging; stacks of timber, earth banks, or built-up
  staging of piles and trestles have all been employed, also iron staging,
  which can be rapidly erected and moved from site to site. The most
  ordinary type of staging consists of timber piles at nearly equal
  distances of 20 ft. to 30 ft., carrying a timber platform, on which the
  bridge is erected. Sometimes a wide space is left for navigation, and the
  platform at this part is carried by a timber and iron truss. When the
  headway is great or the river deep, timber-braced piers or clusters of
  piles at distances of 50 ft. to 100 ft. may be used. These carry
  temporary trusses of timber or steel. The Kuilenburg bridge in Holland,
  which has a span of 492 ft., was erected on a timber staging of this
  kind, containing 81,000 cub. ft. of timber and 5 tons of bolts. The
  bridge superstructure weighed 2150 tons, so that 38 cub. ft. of timber
  were used per ton of superstructure.</p>

  <p>(2) The Britannia and Conway bridges were built on staging on shore,
  lifted by pontoons, floated out to their position between the piers, and
  lastly lifted into place by hydraulic presses. The Moerdyk bridge in
  Holland, with 14 spans of 328 ft., was erected in a similar way. The
  convenience of erecting girders on shore is very great, but there is some
  risk in the floating operations and a good deal of hauling plant is
  required.</p>

  <p>(3) If a bridge consists of girders continuous over two or more spans,
  it may be put together on the embankment at one end and rolled over the
  piers. In some cases hauling tackle is used, in others power is applied
  by levers and ratchets to the rollers on which the girders travel. In
  such rolling operations the girder is subjected to straining actions
  different from those which it is intended to resist, and parts intended
  for tension may be in compression; hence it may need to be stiffened by
  timber during rolling. The bending action on the bottom boom in passing
  over the rollers is also severe. Modifications of the system have been
  adopted for bridges with discontinuous spans. In narrow ravines a bridge
  of one span may be rolled out, if the projecting end is supported on a
  temporary suspension cable anchored on each side. The free end is slung
  to a block running on the cable. If the bridge is erected when the river
  is nearly dry a travelling stage may be constructed to carry the
  projecting end of the girder while it is hauled across, the other end
  resting on one abutment. Sometimes a girder is rolled out about one-third
  of its length, and then supported on a floating pontoon.</p>

  <p>(4) Some types of bridge can be built out from the abutments, the
  completed part forming an erecting stage on which lifting appliances are
  fixed. Generally, in addition, wire cables are stretched across the span,
  from which lifting tackle is suspended. In bridges so erected the
  straining action during erection must be studied, and material must be
  added to resist erecting stresses. In the case of the St Louis bridge,
  half arches were built out on either side of each pier, so that the load
  balanced. Skeleton towers on the piers supported chains attached to the
  arched ribs at suitable points. In spite of careful provision, much
  difficulty was experienced in making the connexion at the crown, from the
  expansion due to temperature changes. The Douro bridge was similarly
  erected. The girders of the side spans were rolled out so as to overhang
  the great span by 105 ft., and formed a platform from which parts of the
  arch could be suspended. Dwarf towers, built on the arch ring at the
  fifth panel from either side, helped to support the girder above, in
  erecting the centre part of the arch (Seyrig, <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>
  lxiii. p. 177). The great cantilever bridges have been erected in the
  same way, and they are specially adapted for erection by building
  out.</p>

<h4><i>Straining Actions and Working Stresses.</i></h4>

  <p>17. In metal bridges wrought iron has been replaced by mild
  steel&mdash;a stronger, tougher and better material. Ingot metal or mild
  steel was sometimes treacherous when first introduced, and accidents
  occurred, the causes of which were obscure. In fact, small differences of
  composition or variations in thermal treatment during manufacture involve
  relatively large differences of quality. Now it is understood that care
  must be taken in specifying the exact quality and in testing the material
  supplied. Structural wrought iron has a tenacity of 20 to 22½ tons per
  sq. in. in the direction of rolling, and an ultimate elongation of 8 or
  10% in 8 in. Across the direction of rolling the tenacity is about 18
  tons per sq. in., and the elongation 3% in 8 in. Steel has only a small
  difference of quality in different directions. There is still controversy
  as to what degree of hardness, or (which is nearly the same thing) what
  percentage of carbon, can be permitted with safety in steel for
  structures.</p>

  <p>The qualities of steel used may be classified as
  follows:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Soft steel, having a tenacity of 22½ to 26 tons
  per sq. in., and an elongation of 32 to 24% in 8 in. (<i>b</i>) Medium
  steel, having a tenacity of 26 to 34 tons per sq. in., and 28 to 25%
  elongation. (<i>c</i>) Moderately hard steel, having a tenacity of 34 to
  37 tons per sq. in., and 17% elongation, (<i>d</i>) Hard steel, having a
  tenacity of 37 to 40 tons per sq. in., and 10% elongation. Soft steel is
  used for rivets always, and sometimes for the whole superstructure of a
  bridge, but medium steel more generally for the plates, angle bars,
  &amp;c., the weight of the bridge being then reduced by about 7% for a
  given factor of safety. Moderately hard steel has been used for the
  larger members of long-span bridges. Hard steel, if used at all, is used
  only for compression members, in which there is less risk of flaws
  extending than in tension members. With medium or moderately hard steel
  all rivet holes should be drilled, or punched &#x215B; in. less in
  diameter than the rivet and reamed out, so as to remove the ring of
  material strained by the punch.</p>

  <p>In the specification for bridge material, drawn up by the British
  Engineering Standards Committee, it is provided that the steel shall be
  acid or basic open-hearth steel, containing not more than 0.06% of
  sulphur or phosphorus. Plates, angles and bars, other than rivet bars,
  must have a tensile strength of 28 to 32 tons per sq. in., with an
  elevation of 20% in 8 in. Rivet bars tested on a gauge length eight times
  the diameter must have a tensile strength of 26 to 30 tons per sq. in.
  and an elongation of 25%.</p>

  <p>18. <i>Straining Actions.</i>&mdash;The external forces acting on a
  bridge may be classified as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) The <i>live</i> or <i>temporary load</i>, for road bridges the
  weight of a dense crowd uniformly distributed, or the weight of a heavy
  wagon or traction engine; for railway bridges the weight of the heaviest
  train likely to come on the bridge. (2) An allowance is sometimes made
  for <i>impact</i>, that is the dynamical action of the live load due to
  want of vertical balance in the moving parts of locomotives, to
  irregularities of the permanent way, or to yielding of the structure. (3)
  The <i>dead load</i> comprises the weight of the main girders, flooring
  and wind bracing, or the total weight of the superstructure exclusive of
  any part directly carried by the piers. This is usually treated as
  uniformly distributed over the span. (4) The <i>horizontal pressure</i>
  due to a wind blowing transversely to the span, which becomes of
  importance in long and high bridges. (5) The <i>longitudinal drag</i> due
  to the friction of a train when braked, about one-seventh of the weight
  of the train. (6) On a curved bridge the <i>centrifugal load</i> due to
  the radical acceleration of the train. If <i>w</i> is the weight of a
  locomotive in tons, <i>r</i> the radius of curvature of the track,
  <i>v</i> the velocity in feet per sec.; then the horizontal force exerted
  on the bridge is <i>wv</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>gr</i> tons. (7) In some cases,
  especially in arch and suspension bridges, changes of temperature set up
  stresses equivalent to those produced by an external load. In Europe a
  variation of temperature of 70° C. or 126° F. is commonly assumed. For
  this the expansion is about 1 in. in 100 ft. Generally a structure should
  be anchored at one point and free to move if possible in other
  directions. Roughly, if expansion is prevented, a stress of one ton per
  sq. in. is set up in steel structures for each 12° change of
  temperature.</p>

  <p>i. <i>Live Load on Road Bridges.</i>&mdash;A dense crowd of people may
  be taken as a uniform load of 80 to 120 lb per sq. ft. But in recent
  times the weight of traction engines and wagons which pass over bridges
  has increased, and this kind of load generally produces greater straining
  action than a crowd of people. In manufacturing districts and near large
  towns loads of 30 tons may come on road bridges, and county and borough
  authorities insist on provision being made for such loads. In Switzerland
  roads are divided into three classes according to their importance, and
  the following loads are prescribed, the designer having to provide
  sufficient strength either for a uniformly distributed crowd, or for a
  heavy wagon anywhere on the roadway:&mdash; <!-- Page 547 --><span

  <p>Large as these loads are on short spans, they are not more than must
  often be provided for.</p>

  <p><i>Live Load on Railway Bridges.</i>&mdash;The live load is the weight
  of the heaviest train which can come on the bridge. In the earlier girder
  bridges the live load was taken to be equivalent to a uniform load of 1
  ton per foot run for each line of way. At that time locomotives on
  railways of 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge weighed at most 35 to 45 tons, and their
  length between buffers was such that the average load did not exceed 1
  ton per foot run. Trains of wagons did not weigh more than three-quarters
  of a ton per foot run when most heavily loaded. The weights of engines
  and wagons are now greater, and in addition it is recognized that the
  concentration of the loading at the axles gives rise to greater straining
  action, especially in short bridges, than the same load uniformly
  distributed along the span. Hence many of the earlier bridges have had to
  be strengthened to carry modern traffic. The following examples of some
  of the heaviest locomotives on English railways is given by W.B. Farr
  (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> cxli. p. 12):&mdash;</p>

  <p>It would be simpler and more convenient in designing short bridges if,
  instead of assuming an equivalent uniform rolling load, agreement could
  be come to as to a typical heavy locomotive which would produce stresses
  as great as any existing locomotive on each class of railway. Bridges
  would then be designed for these selected loads, and the process would be
  safer in dealing with flooring girders and shearing forces than the
  assumption of a uniform load.</p>

  <p>Some American locomotives are very heavy. Thus a consolidation engine
  may weigh 126 tons with a length over buffers of 57 ft., corresponding to
  an average load of 2.55 tons per ft. run. Also long ore wagons are used
  which weigh loaded two tons per ft. run. J.A.L. Waddell (<i>De
  Pontibus</i>, New York, 1898) proposes to arrange railways in seven
  classes, according to the live loads which may be expected from the
  character of their traffic, and to construct bridges in accordance with
  this classification. For the lightest class, he takes a locomotive and
  tender of 93.5 tons, 52 ft. between buffers (average load 1.8 tons per
  ft. run), and for the heaviest a locomotive and tender weighing 144.5
  tons, 52 ft. between buffers (average load 2.77 tons per ft. run). Wagons
  he assumes to weigh for the lightest class 1.3 tons per ft. run and for
  the heaviest 1.9 tons. He takes as the live load for a bridge two such
  engines, followed by a train of wagons covering the span. Waddell's tons
  are short tons of 2000 lb.</p>

  <p>ii. <i>Impact.</i>&mdash;If a vertical load is imposed suddenly, but
  without velocity, work is done during deflection, and the deformation and
  stress are momentarily double those due to the same load at rest on the
  structure. No load of exactly this kind is ever applied to a bridge. But
  if a load is so applied that the deflection increases with speed, the
  stress is greater than that due to a very gradually applied load, and
  vibrations about a mean position are set up. The rails not being
  absolutely straight and smooth, centrifugal and lurching actions occur
  which alter the distribution of the loading. Again, rapidly changing
  forces, due to the moving parts of the engine which are unbalanced
  vertically, act on the bridge; and, lastly, inequalities of level at the
  rail ends give rise to shocks. For all these reasons the stresses due to
  the live load are greater than those due to the same load resting quietly
  on the bridge. This increment is larger on the flooring girders than on
  the main ones, and on short main girders than on long ones. The impact
  stresses depend so much on local conditions that it is difficult to fix
  what allowance should be made. E.H. Stone (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. of C.E.</i>
  xli. p. 467) collated some measurements of deflection taken during
  official trials of Indian bridges, and found the increment of deflection
  due to impact to depend on the ratio of dead to live load. By plotting
  and averaging he obtained the following results:&mdash;</p>

  that due to a resting Load.</i></p>

  <p>These results are for the centre deflections of main girders, but
  Stone infers that the augmentation of stress for any member, due to
  causes included in impact allowance, will be the same percentage for the
  same ratios of live to dead load stresses. Valuable measurements of the
  deformations of girders and tension members due to moving trains have
  been made by S.W. Robinson (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> xvi.) and by F.E.
  Turneaure (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> xli.). The latter used a recording
  deflectometer and two recording extensometers. The observations are
  difficult, and the inertia of the instrument is liable to cause error,
  but much care was taken. The most striking conclusions from the results
  are that the locomotive balance weights have a large effect in causing
  vibration, and next, that in certain cases the vibrations are cumulative,
  reaching a value greater than that due to any single impact action.
  Generally: (1) At speeds less than 25 m. an hour there is not much
  vibration. (2) The increase of deflection due to impact at 40 or 50 m. an
  hour is likely to reach 40 to 50% for girder spans of less than 50 ft.
  (3) This percentage decreases rapidly for longer spans, becoming about
  25% for 75-ft. spans. (4) The increase per cent of boom stresses due to
  impact is about the same as that of deflection; that in web bracing bars
  is rather greater. (5) Speed of train produces no effect on the mean
  deflection, but only on the magnitude of the vibrations.</p>

  <p>A purely empirical allowance for impact stresses has been proposed,
  amounting to 20% of the live load stresses for floor stringers; 15% for
  floor cross girders; and for main girders, 10% for 40-ft. spans, and 5%
  for 100-ft. spans. These percentages are added to the live load
  stresses.</p>

  <p>iii. <i>Dead Load.</i>&mdash;The dead load consists of the weight of
  main girders, flooring and wind-bracing. It is generally reckoned to be
  uniformly distributed, but in large spans the distribution of weight in
  the main girders should be calculated and taken into account. The weight
  of the bridge flooring depends on the type adopted. Road bridges vary so
  much in the character of the flooring that no general rule can be given.
  In railway bridges the weight of sleepers, rails, &amp;c., is 0.2 to 0.25
  tons per ft. run for each line of way, while the rail girders, cross
  girders, &amp;c., weigh 0.15 to 0.2 tons. If a footway is added about 0.4
  ton per ft. run may be allowed for this. The weight of main girders
  increases with the span, and there is for any type of bridge a limiting
  span beyond which the dead load stresses exceed the assigned limit of
  working stress.</p>

  <p>Let W<sub><i>l</i></sub> be the total live load, W<sub><i>f</i></sub>
  the total flooring load on a bridge of span <i>l</i>, both being
  considered for the present purpose to be uniform per ft. run. Let
  <i>k</i>(W<sub><i>l</i></sub>+W<sub><i>f</i></sub>) be the weight of main
  girders designed to carry W<sub><i>l</i></sub>+W<sub><i>f</i></sub>, but
  not their own weight in addition. Then</p>

  <p>Since in designing a bridge W<sub><i>l</i></sub>+W<sub><i>f</i></sub>
  is known, <i>k</i>(W<sub><i>l</i></sub>+W<sub><i>f</i></sub>) can be
  found from a provisional design in which the weight W<sub><i>g</i></sub>
  is neglected. The actual bridge must have the section of all members
  greater than those in the provisional design in the ratio
  <i>k</i>/(1-<i>k</i>).</p>

  <p>Waddell (<i>De Pontibus</i>) gives the following convenient empirical
  relations. Let <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> be the weights
  of main girders per ft. run for a live load <i>p</i> per ft. run and
  spans <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>. Then</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>w</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>w</i><sub>1</sub> = ½ [<i>l</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>l</i><sub>1</sub>+(<i>l</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>l</i><sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>].</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now let <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>&prime;, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>&prime; be
  the girder weights per ft. run for spans <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>,
  <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>, and live loads <i>p</i>&prime; per ft. run.
  Then</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>w</i><sub>2</sub>&prime;/<i>w</i><sub>2</sub> = 1/5(1+4<i>p</i>&prime;/<i>p</i>)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>w</i><sub>2</sub>&prime;/<i>w</i><sub>1</sub> = 1/10[<i>l</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>l</i><sub>1</sub>+(<i>l</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>l</i><sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>](1+4<i>p</i>&prime;/<i>p</i>)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A partially rational approximate formula for the weight of main
  girders is the following (Unwin, <i>Wrought Iron Bridges and Roofs</i>,
  1869, p. 40):&mdash;</p>

  <p>Let <i>w</i> = total live load per ft. run of girder;
  <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> the weight of platform per ft. run;
  <i>w</i><sub>3</sub> the weight of main girders per ft. run, all in tons;
  <i>l</i> = span in ft.; <i>s</i> = average stress in tons per sq. in. on
  gross section of metal; <i>d</i> = depth of girder at centre in ft.;
  <i>r</i> = ratio of span to depth of girder so that <i>r</i> =
  <i>l</i>/<i>d</i>. Then</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>w</i><sub>3</sub> = (<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>l</i><sup>2</sup>/(C<i>ds</i>-<i>l</i><sub>2</sub>) = (<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>lr</i>/(C<i>s</i>-<i>lr</i>),</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>where C is a constant for any type of girder. It is not easy to fix
  the average stress <i>s</i> per sq. in. of gross section. Hence the
  formula is more useful in the form</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>w</i> = (<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>l</i><sup>2</sup>/(K<i>d</i>-<i>l</i><sup>2</sup>) = (<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>lr</i>/(K-<i>lr</i>)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>where K =
  (<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>+<i>w</i><sub>3</sub>)<i>lr</i>/<i>w</i><sub>3</sub>
  is to be deduced from the data of some bridge previously designed with
  the same working stresses. From some known examples, C varies from 1500
  to 1800 for iron braced parallel or bowstring girders, and from 1200 to
  1500 for similar girders of steel. K = 6000 to 7200 for iron and = 7200
  to 9000 for steel bridges.</p>

  <p>iv. <i>Wind Pressure.</i>&mdash;Much attention has been given to wind
  action since the disaster to the Tay bridge in 1879. As to the maximum
  wind pressure on small plates normal to the wind, there is not much
  doubt. Anemometer observations show that pressures of 30 lb per sq. ft.
  occur in storms annually in many localities, and that occasionally higher
  pressures are recorded in exposed positions. Thus at Bidstone, Liverpool,
  where the gauge has an exceptional exposure, a pressure of 80 lb per sq.
  ft. has been observed. In tornadoes, such as that at St Louis in 1896, it
  has been calculated, from the stability of structures overturned, that
  pressures of 45 to 90 lb per sq. ft. must have been reached. As to
  anemometer pressures, it should be observed that the recorded pressure is
  made up of a positive front and negative (vacuum) back pressure, but in
  structures the latter must be absent or only partially developed. Great
  difference of opinion exists as to whether on large surfaces the average
  pressure per sq. ft. is as great as on small surfaces, such as anemometer
  plates. The experiments of Sir B. Baker at the Forth bridge showed that
  on a surface 30 ft. × 15 ft. the intensity of pressure was less than on a
  similarly exposed anemometer plate. In the case of bridges there is the
  further difficulty that some surfaces partially <!-- Page 549 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page549"></a>[v.04 p.0549]</span>shield other
  surfaces; one girder, for instance, shields the girder behind it (see
  <i>Brit. Assoc. Report</i>, 1884). In 1881 a committee of the Board of
  Trade decided that the maximum wind pressure on a vertical surface in
  Great Britain should be assumed in designing structures to be 56 lb per
  sq. ft. For a plate girder bridge of less height than the train, the wind
  is to be taken to act on a surface equal to the projected area of one
  girder and the exposed part of a train covering the bridge. In the case
  of braced girder bridges, the wind pressure is taken as acting on a
  continuous surface extending from the rails to the top of the carriages,
  plus the vertical projected area of so much of one girder as is exposed
  above the train or below the rails. In addition, an allowance is made for
  pressure on the leeward girder according to a scale. The committee
  recommended that a factor of safety of 4 should be taken for wind
  stresses. For safety against overturning they considered a factor of 2
  sufficient. In the case of bridges not subject to Board of Trade
  inspection, the allowance for wind pressure varies in different cases. C.
  Shaler Smith allows 300 lb per ft. run for the pressure on the side of a
  train, and in addition 30 lb per sq. ft. on twice the vertical projected
  area of one girder, treating the pressure on the train as a travelling
  load. In the case of bridges of less than 50 ft. span he also provides
  strength to resist a pressure of 50 lb per sq. ft. on twice the vertical
  projection of one truss, no train being supposed to be on the bridge.</p>

  <p>19. <i>Stresses Permitted.</i>&mdash;For a long time engineers held
  the convenient opinion that, if the total dead and live load stress on
  any section of a structure (of iron) did not exceed 5 tons per sq. in.,
  ample safety was secured. It is no longer possible to design by so simple
  a rule. In an interesting address to the British Association in 1885, Sir
  B. Baker described the condition of opinion as to the safe limits of
  stress as chaotic. "The old foundations," he said, "are shaken, and
  engineers have not come to an agreement respecting the rebuilding of the
  structure. The variance in the strength of existing bridges is such as to
  be apparent to the educated eye without any calculation. In the present
  day engineers are in accord as to the principles of estimating the
  magnitude of the stresses on the members of a structure, but not so in
  proportioning the members to resist those stresses. The practical result
  is that a bridge which would be passed by the English Board of Trade
  would require to be strengthened 5% in some parts and 60% in others,
  before it would be accepted by the German government, or by any of the
  leading railway companies in America." Sir B. Baker then described the
  results of experiments on repetition of stress, and added that "hundreds
  of existing bridges which carry twenty trains a day with perfect safety
  would break down quickly under twenty trains an hour. This fact was
  forced on my attention nearly twenty-five years ago by the fracture of a
  number of girders of ordinary strength under a five-minutes' train
  service."</p>

  <p>Practical experience taught engineers that though 5 tons per sq. in.
  for iron, or 6½ tons per sq. in. for steel, was safe or more than safe
  for long bridges with large ratio of dead to live load, it was not safe
  for short ones in which the stresses are mainly due to live load, the
  weight of the bridge being small. The experiments of A. Wöhler, repeated
  by Johann Bauschinger, Sir B. Baker and others, show that the breaking
  stress of a bar is not a fixed quantity, but depends on the range of
  variation of stress to which it is subjected, if that variation is
  repeated a very large number of times. Let K be the breaking strength of
  a bar per unit of section, when it is loaded once gradually to breaking.
  This may be termed the statical breaking strength. Let
  <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> be the breaking strength of the same bar
  when subjected to stresses varying from <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> to
  <i>k</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub> alternately and repeated an indefinitely
  great number of times; <i>k</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub> is to be reckoned +
  if of the same kind as <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> and - if of the
  opposite kind (tension or thrust). The range of stress is therefore
  <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>-<i>k</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub>, if the
  stresses are both of the same kind, and
  <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>+<i>k</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub>, if they
  are of opposite kinds. Let <span class="grk">&Delta;</span> =
  <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> ± <i>k</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub> = the
  range of stress, where <span class="grk">&Delta;</span> is always
  positive. Then Wöhler's results agree closely with the rule,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = ½<span class="grk">&Delta;</span>+&radic;(K²-<i>n</i><span class="grk">&Delta;</span>K),</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>where n is a constant which varies from 1.3 to 2 in various qualities
  of iron and steel. For ductile iron or mild steel it may be taken as 1.5.
  For a statical load, range of stress nil, <span
  class="grk">&Delta;</span> = 0, <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = K, the
  statical breaking stress. For a bar so placed that it is alternately
  loaded and the load removed, <span class="grk">&Delta;</span> =
  <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = 0.6
  K. For a bar subjected to alternate tension and compression of equal
  amount, <span class="grk">&Delta;</span> = 2
  <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = 0.33
  K. The safe working stress in these different cases is
  <i>k</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> divided by the factor of safety. It is
  sometimes said that a bar is "fatigued" by repeated straining. The real
  nature of the action is not well understood, but the word fatigue may be
  used, if it is not considered to imply more than that the breaking stress
  under repetition of loading diminishes as the range of variation
  increases.</p>

  <p>It was pointed out as early as 1869 (Unwin, <i>Wrought Iron Bridges
  and Roofs</i>) that a rational method of fixing the working stress, so
  far as knowledge went at that time, would be to make it depend on the
  ratio of live to dead load, and in such a way that the factor of safety
  for the live load stresses was double that for the dead load stresses.
  Let A be the dead load and B the live load, producing stress in a bar;
  <span class="grk">&rho;</span> = B/A the ratio of live to dead load;
  <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> the safe working limit of stress for a bar subjected
  to a dead load only and <i>f</i> the safe working stress in any other
  case. Then</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>f</i><sub>1</sub> (A+B)/(A+2B) = <i>f</i><sub>1</sub>(1+<span class="grk">&rho;</span>)/(1+2<span class="grk">&rho;</span>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The following table gives values of <i>f</i> so computed on the
  assumption that <i>f</i><sub>1</sub> = 7½ tons per sq. in. for iron and 9
  tons per sq. in. for steel.</p>

  <p>Bridge sections designed by this rule differ little from those
  designed by formulae based directly on Wöhler's experiments. This rule
  has been revived in America, and appears to be increasingly relied on in
  bridge-designing. (See <i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> xli. p. 156.)</p>

  <p>The method of J.J. Weyrauch and W. Launhardt, based on an empirical
  expression for Wöhler's law, has been much used in bridge designing (see
  <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> lxiii. p. 275). Let <i>t</i> be the <i>statical
  breaking strength</i> of a bar, loaded once gradually up to fracture
  (<i>t</i> = breaking load divided by original area of section); <i>u</i>
  the breaking strength of a bar loaded and unloaded an indefinitely great
  number of times, the stress varying from <i>u</i> to 0 alternately (this
  is termed the <i>primitive strength</i>); and, lastly, let <i>s</i> be
  the breaking strength of a bar subjected to an indefinitely great number
  of repetitions of stresses equal and opposite in sign (tension and
  thrust), so that the stress ranges alternately from <i>s</i> to
  -<i>s</i>. This is termed the <i>vibration strength</i>. Wöhler's and
  Bauschinger's experiments give values of <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, and
  <i>s</i>, for some materials. If a bar is subjected to alternations of
  stress having the range <span class="grk">&Delta;</span> =
  <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>-<i>f</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub>, then, by
  Wöhler's law, the bar will ultimately break, if</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = F<span class="grk">&Delta;</span>, . . . (1)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>where F is some unknown function. Launhardt found that, for stresses
  always of the same kind, F =
  (<i>t</i>-<i>u</i>)/(<i>t</i>-<i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>)
  approximately agreed with experiment. For stresses of different kinds
  Weyrauch found F =
  (<i>u</i>-<i>s</i>)/(2<i>u</i>-<i>s</i>-<i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>)
  to be similarly approximate. Now let
  <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>/<i>f</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub> = <span
  class="grk">&phi;</span>, where <span class="grk">&phi;</span> is + or -
  according as the stresses are of the same or opposite signs. Putting the
  values of F in (1) and solving for <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>, we get
  for the breaking stress of a bar subjected to repetition of varying
  stress,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = <i>u</i>(1+(<i>t</i>-<i>u</i>)<span class="grk">&phi;</span>/<i>u</i>)   [Stresses of same sign.]</p>
      <p><i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> = <i>u</i>(1+(<i>u</i>-<i>s</i>)<span class="grk">&phi;</span>/<i>u</i>)   [Stresses of opposite sign.]</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The working stress in any case is <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>
  divided by a factor of safety. Let that factor be 3. Then Wöhler's
  results for iron and Bauschinger's for steel give the following equations
  for tension or thrust:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Iron, working stress, <i>f</i> = 4.4 (1+½<span class="grk">&phi;</span>)</p>
      <p>Steel, working stress, <i>f</i> = 5.87 (1+½<span class="grk">&phi;</span>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In these equations <span class="grk">&phi;</span> is to have its + or
  - value according to the case considered. For shearing stresses the
  working stress may have 0.8 of its value for tension. The following table
  gives values of the working stress calculated by these
  equations:&mdash;</p>

  <p>To compare this with the previous table, <span

  Except when the limiting stresses are of opposite sign, the two tables
  agree very well. In bridge work this occurs only in some of the bracing
  bars.</p>

  <p>It is a matter of discussion whether, if fatigue is allowed for by the
  Weyrauch method, an additional allowance should be made for impact. There
  was no impact in Wöhler's experiments, and therefore it would seem
  rational to add the impact allowance to that for fatigue; but in that
  case the bridge sections become larger than experience shows to be
  necessary. Some engineers escape this difficulty by asserting that
  Wöhler's results are not applicable to bridge work. They reject the
  allowance for fatigue (that is, the effect of repetition) and design
  bridge members for the total dead and live load, plus a large allowance
  for impact varied according to some purely empirical rule. (See Waddell,
  <i>De Pontibus</i>, p.7.) Now in applying Wöhler's law,
  <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub> for any bridge member is found for the
  maximum possible live load, a live load which though it may sometimes
  come on the bridge and must therefore be provided for, is not the usual
  live load to which the bridge is subjected. Hence the range of stress,
  <i>f</i><sub><i>max.</i></sub>-<i>f</i><sub><i>min.</i></sub>, from which
  the working stress is deduced, is not the ordinary range of stress which
  is repeated a practically infinite number of times, but is a range of
  stress to which the bridge is subjected only at comparatively long
  intervals. Hence practically it appears probable that the allowance for
  fatigue made in either of the tables above is sufficient to cover the
  ordinary effects of impact also.</p>

  <p>English bridge-builders are somewhat hampered in adopting rational
  limits of working stress by the rules of the Board of Trade. Nor do they
  all accept the guidance of Wöhler's law. The following are some examples
  of limits adopted. For the Dufferin bridge (steel) the working stress was
  taken at 6.5 tons per sq. in. in bottom booms and diagonals, 6.0 tons in
  top booms, 5.0 tons in verticals and long compression members. For the
  Stanley bridge at Brisbane the limits were 6.5 tons per sq. in. in
  compression boom, 7.0 tons in tension boom, 5.0 tons in vertical struts,
  6.5 tons in diagonal ties, 8.0 tons in wind bracing, and 6.5 tons in
  cross and rail girders. In the new Tay bridge the limit of stress is
  generally 5 tons per sq. in., but in members in which the stress changes
  sign 4 tons per sq. in. In the Forth bridge for members in which the
  stress varied from 0 to a maximum frequently, the limit was 5.0 tons per
  sq. in., or if the stress varied rarely 5.6 tons per sq. in.; for members
  subjected to alternations of tension and thrust frequently 3.3 tons per
  sq. in. or 5 tons per sq. in. if the alternations were infrequent. The
  shearing area of rivets in tension members was made 1½ times the useful
  section of plate in tension. For compression members the shearing area of
  rivets in butt-joints was made half the useful section of plate in
  compression.</p>

  <p>20. <i>Determination of Stresses in the Members of
  Bridges.</i>&mdash;It is convenient to consider beam girder or truss
  bridges, and it is the stresses in the main girders which primarily
  require to be determined. A main girder consists of an upper and lower
  flange, boom or chord and a vertical web. The loading forces to be
  considered are vertical, the horizontal forces due to wind pressure are
  treated separately and provided for by a horizontal system of bracing.
  For practical purposes it is accurate enough to consider the booms or
  chords as carrying exclusively the horizontal tension and compression and
  the web as resisting the whole of the vertical and, in a plate web, the
  equal horizontal shearing forces. Let fig. 37 represent a beam with any
  system of loads W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, ...
  W<sub><i>n</i></sub>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Consider any section <i>a b</i>. The total shear at <i>a b</i> is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>S = R-&sum;(W<sub>1</sub>+W<sub>2</sub> ...)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>where the summation extends to all the loads to the left of the
  section. Let <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> ... be the
  distances of the loads from <i>a b</i>, and <i>p</i> the distance of
  R<sub>1</sub> from <i>a b</i>; then the bending moment at <i>a b</i>
  is</p>

  <p>where the summation extends to all the loads to the left of <i>a

  expressions are similar and give the same results.</p>

  <p>If A<sub><i>t</i></sub> A<sub><i>c</i></sub> are the cross sections of
  the tension and compression flanges or chords, and <i>h</i> the distance

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>H<sub><i>t</i></sub> = H<sub><i>c</i></sub> = M/<i>h</i></p>

      <p><i>f</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> = S/A</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and the intensity on horizontal sections is the same. If the web is a
  braced web, then the vertical component of the stress in the web bars cut
  by the section must be equal to S.</p>

  of braced structures the following method is convenient: When a section
  of a girder can be taken cutting only three bars, the stresses in the
  bars can be found by taking moments. In fig. 38 <i>m n</i> cuts three
  bars, and the forces in the three bars cut by the section are C, S and T.
  There are to the left of the section the external forces, R,
  W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>. Let <i>s</i> be the perpendicular from O,
  the join of C and T on the direction of S; <i>t</i> the perpendicular
  from A, the join of C and S on the direction of T; and <i>c</i> the
  perpendicular from B, the join of S and T on the direction of C. Taking
  moments about O,</p>

  </div>
  <p>Or generally, if M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub> M<sub>3</sub> are the
  moments of the external forces to the left of O, A, and B respectively,
  and <i>s</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>c</i> the perpendiculars from O, A and B on

  <p>22. <i>Distribution of Bending Moment and Shearing
  Force.</i>&mdash;Let a girder of span <i>l</i>, fig. 39, supported at the
  ends, carry a fixed load W at m from the right abutment. The reactions at
  the abutments are R<sub>1</sub> = W<i>m</i>/<i>l</i> and R<sub>2</sub> =
  W(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>)/<i>l</i>. The shears on vertical sections to the
  left and right of the load are R<sub>1</sub> and -R<sub>2</sub>, and the
  distribution of shearing force is given by two rectangles. Bending moment
  increases uniformly from either abutment to the load, at which the
  bending moment is M = R<sub>2</sub><i>m</i> =
  R<sub>1</sub>(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>). The distribution of bending moment is
  given by the ordinates of a triangle. Next let the girder carry a uniform
  load <i>w</i> per ft. run (fig. 40). The total load <!-- Page 551
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page551"></a>[v.04 p.0551]</span>is
  <i>wl</i>; the reactions at abutments, R<sub>1</sub> = R<sub>2</sub> =
  ½<i>wl</i>. The distribution of shear on vertical sections is given by
  the ordinates of a sloping line. The greatest bending moment is at the
  centre and = M<sub><i>c</i></sub> = &#x215B;<i>wl</i><sup>2</sup>. At any
  point <i>x</i> from the abutment, the bending moment is M =
  ½<i>wx</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>), an equation to a parabola.</p>

  <p>23. <i>Shear due to Travelling Loads.</i>&mdash;Let a uniform train
  weighing <i>w</i> per ft. run advance over a girder of span 2<i>c</i>,
  from the left abutment. When it covers the girder to a distance <i>x</i>
  from the centre (fig. 41) the total load is <i>w</i>(<i>c</i>+<i>x</i>);
  the reaction at B is</p>

  </div>
  <p>which is also the shearing force at C for that position of the load.
  As the load travels, the shear at the head of the train will be given by
  the ordinates of a parabola having its vertex at A, and a maximum
  F<sub><i>max.</i></sub> = -½<i>wl</i> at B. If the load travels the
  reverse way, the shearing force at the head of the train is given by the
  ordinates of the dotted parabola. The greatest shear at C for any
  position of the load occurs when the head of the train is at C. For any
  load <i>p</i> between C and B will increase the reaction at B and
  therefore the shear at C by part of <i>p</i>, but at the same time will
  diminish the shear at C by the whole of <i>p</i>. The web of a girder
  must resist the maximum shear, and, with a travelling load like a railway
  train, this is greater for partial than for complete loading. Generally a
  girder supports both a dead and a live load. The distribution of total
  shear, due to a dead load <i>w</i><sub><i>l</i></sub> per ft. run and a
  travelling load <i>w</i><sub><i>l</i></sub> per ft. run, is shown in fig.
  42, arranged so that the dead load shear is added to the maximum
  travelling load shear of the same sign.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:22%;">
      <a href="images/bridges_43.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/bridges_43.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 43.
  </div>
  <p>24. <i>Counterbracing.</i>&mdash;In the case of girders with braced
  webs, the tension bars of which are not adapted to resist a thrust,
  another circumstance due to the position of the live load must be
  considered. For a train advancing from the left, the travelling load
  shear in the left half of the span is of a different sign from that due
  to the dead load. Fig. 43 shows the maximum shear at vertical sections
  due to a dead and travelling load, the latter advancing (fig. 43,
  <i>a</i>) from the left and (fig. 43, <i>b</i>) from the right abutment.
  Comparing the figures it will be seen that over a distance x near the
  middle of the girder the shear changes sign, according as the load
  advances from the left or the right. The bracing bars, therefore, for
  this part of the girder must be adapted to resist either tension or
  thrust. Further, the range of stress to which they are subjected is the
  sum of the stresses due to the load advancing from the left or the
  right.</p>

  </div>
  <p><br style="clear : both" /></p>
  <p>25. <i>Greatest Shear when concentrated Loads travel over the
  Bridge.</i>&mdash;To find the greatest shear with a set of concentrated
  loads at fixed distances, let the loads advance from the left abutment,
  and let C be the section at which the shear is required (fig. 44). The
  greatest shear at C may occur with W<sub>1</sub> at C. If W<sub>1</sub>
  passes beyond C, the shear at C will probably be greatest when
  W<sub>2</sub> is at C. Let R be the resultant of the loads on the bridge
  when W<sub>1</sub> is at C. Then the reaction at B and shear at C is
  R<i>n</i>/<i>l</i>. Next let the loads advance a distance a so that
  W<sub>2</sub> comes to C. Then the shear at C is
  R(<i>n</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>-W<sub>1</sub>, plus any reaction <i>d</i>
  at B, due to any additional load which has come on the girder during the
  movement. The shear will therefore be increased by bringing W<sub>2</sub>
  to C, if R<i>a</i>/<i>l</i>+<i>d</i> > W<sub>1</sub> and <i>d</i> is
  generally small and negligible. This result is modified if the action of
  the load near the section is distributed to the bracing intersections by
  rail and cross girders. In fig. 45 the action of W is distributed to A
  and B by the flooring. Then the loads at A and B are
  W(<i>p</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>p</i> and W<i>x</i>/<i>p</i>. Now let C (fig. 46)
  be the section at which the greatest shear is required, and let the loads
  advance from the left till W<sub>1</sub> is at C. If R is the resultant
  of the loads then on the girder, the reaction at B and shear at C is
  R<i>n</i>/<i>l</i>. But the shear may be greater when W<sub>2</sub> is at
  C. In that case the shear at C becomes
  R(<i>n</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>+<i>d</i>-W<sub>1</sub>, if <i>a</i> >
  <i>p</i>, and
  R(<i>n</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>+<i>d</i>-W<sub>1</sub><i>a</i>/<i>p</i>, if
  <i>a</i> &lt; <i>p</i>. If we neglect <i>d</i>, then the shear increases
  by moving W<sub>2</sub> to C, if R<i>a</i>/<i>l</i> > W<sub>1</sub> in
  the first case, and if R<i>a</i>/<i>l</i> >
  W<sub>1</sub><i>a</i>/<i>p</i> in the second case.</p>

  <p>26. <i>Greatest Bending Moment due to travelling concentrated
  Loads.</i>&mdash;For the greatest bending moment due to a travelling live
  load, let a load of <i>w</i> per ft. run advance from the left abutment
  (fig. 47), and let its centre be at <i>x</i> from the left abutment. The
  reaction at B is 2<i>wx</i>²/<i>l</i> and the bending moment at any
  section C, at <i>m</i> from the left abutment, is
  2<i>wx</i>²/(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>)/<i>l</i>, which increases as <i>x</i>
  increases till the span is covered. Hence, for uniform travelling loads,
  the bending moments are greatest when the loading is complete. In that
  case the loads on either side of C are proportional to <i>m</i> and
  <i>l</i>-<i>m</i>. In the case of a series of travelling loads at fixed
  distances apart passing over the girder from the left, let W<sub>1</sub>,
  W<sub>2</sub> (fig. 48), at distances <i>x</i> and <i>x</i>+<i>a</i> from
  the left abutment, be their resultants on either side of C. Then the
  reaction at B is
  W<sub>1</sub><i>x</i>/<i>l</i>+W<sub>2</sub>(<i>x</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>.
  The bending moment at C is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>M = W<sub>1</sub><i>x</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>)/<i>l</i>+W<sub>2</sub><i>m</i>{1-(<i>x</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>}.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If the loads are moved a distance &#x2206;<i>x</i> to the right, the
  bending moment becomes</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>M+&#x2206;M = W<sub>1</sub>(<i>x</i>+&#x2206;<i>x</i>)(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>)/<i>l</i>+W<sub>2</sub><i>m</i>{1-(<i>x</i>+&#x2206;<i>x</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>}</p>
      <p class="i8">&#x2206;<i>m</i> = W<sub>1</sub>&#x2206;<i>x</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>)/<i>l</i>-W<sub>2</sub>&#x2206;<i>xm</i>/<i>l</i>,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and this is positive or the bending moment increases, if
  W<sub>1</sub>(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>) > W<sub>2</sub><i>m</i>, or if
  W<sub>1</sub>/<i>m</i> > W<sub>2</sub>/(<i>l</i>-<i>m</i>). But these are
  the average loads per ft. run to the left and right of C. Hence, if the
  average load to the left of a section is greater than that to the right,
  the bending moment at the section will be increased by moving the loads
  to the right, and vice versa. Hence the maximum bending moment at C for a
  series of travelling loads will occur when the average load is the same
  on either side of C. If one of the loads is at C, spread over a very
  small distance in the neighbourhood of C, then a very small displacement
  of the loads will permit the fulfilment of the condition. Hence the
  criterion for the position of the loads which makes the moment at C
  greatest is this: one load must be at C, and the other loads must be
  distributed, so that the average loads per ft. on either side of C (the
  load at C being neglected) are nearly equal. If the loads are very
  unequal in magnitude or distance this condition may be satisfied for more
  than one position of the loads, but it is not difficult to ascertain
  which position gives the maximum moment. Generally one of the largest of
  the loads must be at C with as many others to right and left as is
  consistent with that condition.</p>

  <p>This criterion may be stated in another way. The greatest bending
  moment will occur with one of the greatest loads at the section, and when
  this further condition is satisfied. Let fig. 49 represent a beam with
  the series of loads travelling from the right. Let <i>a b</i> be <!--

  load at <i>a b</i> when the bending moment there is greatest, and
  W<sub><i>n</i></sub> the last load to the right then on the bridge. Then
  the position of the loads must be that which satisfies the condition</p>

  <p>Fig. 50 shows the curve of bending moment under one of a series of
  travelling loads at fixed distances. Let W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>,
  W<sub>3</sub> traverse the girder from the left at fixed distances
  <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. For the position shown the distribution of bending
  moment due to W<sub>1</sub> is given by ordinates of the triangle
  A&prime;CB&prime;; that due to W<sub>2</sub> by ordinates of
  A&prime;DB&prime;; and that due to W<sub>3</sub> by ordinates
  A&prime;EB&prime;. The total moment at W<sub>1</sub>, due to three loads,
  is the sum <i>m</i>C+<i>mn</i>+<i>mo</i> of the intercepts which the
  triangle sides cut off from the vertical under W<sub>1</sub>. As the
  loads move over the girder, the points C, D, E describe the parabolas
  M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>, the middle ordinates of
  which are ¼W<sub>1</sub><i>l</i>, ¼W<sub>2</sub><i>l</i>, and
  ¼W<sub>3</sub><i>l</i>. If these are first drawn it is easy, for any
  position of the loads, to draw the lines B&prime;C, B&prime;D, B&prime;E,
  and to find the sum of the intercepts which is the total bending moment
  under a load. The lower portion of the figure is the curve of bending
  moments under the leading load. Till W<sub>1</sub> has advanced a
  distance a only one load is on the girder, and the curve A&Prime;F gives
  bending moments due to W<sub>1</sub> only; as W<sub>1</sub> advances to a
  distance <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>, two loads are on the girder, and the curve FG
  gives moments due to W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>. GB&Prime; is the
  curve of moments for all three loads
  W<sub>1</sub>+W<sub>2</sub>+W<sub>3</sub>.</p>

  <p>Fig. 51 shows maximum bending moment curves for an extreme case of a
  short bridge with very unequal loads. The three lightly dotted parabolas
  are the curves of maximum moment for each of the loads taken separately.
  The three heavily dotted curves are curves of maximum moment under each
  of the loads, for the three loads passing over the bridge, at the given
  distances, from left to right. As might be expected, the moments are
  greatest in this case at the sections under the 15-ton load. The heavy
  continuous line gives the last-mentioned curve for the reverse direction
  of passage of the loads.</p>

  <p>With short bridges it is best to draw the curve of maximum bending
  moments for some assumed typical set of loads in the way just described,
  and to design the girder accordingly. For longer bridges the funicular
  polygon affords a method of determining maximum bending moments which is
  perhaps more convenient. But very great accuracy in drawing this curve is
  unnecessary, because the rolling stock of railways varies so much that
  the precise magnitude and distribution of the loads which will pass over
  a bridge cannot be known. All that can be done is to assume a set of
  loads likely to produce somewhat severer straining than any probable
  actual rolling loads. Now, except for very short bridges and very unequal
  loads, a parabola can be found which includes the curve of maximum
  moments. This parabola is the curve of maximum moments for a travelling
  load uniform per ft. run. Let <i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> be the load per
  ft. run which would produce the maximum moments represented by this
  parabola. Then <i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> may be termed the uniform load
  per ft. equivalent to any assumed set of concentrated loads. Waddell has
  calculated tables of such equivalent uniform loads. But it is not
  difficult to find <i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>, approximately enough for
  practical purposes, very simply. Experience shows that (<i>a</i>) a
  parabola having the same ordinate at the centre of the span, or
  (<i>b</i>) a parabola having the same ordinate at one-quarter span as the
  curve of maximum moments, agrees with it closely enough for practical
  designing. A criterion already given shows the position of any set of
  loads which will produce the greatest bending moment at the centre of the
  bridge, or at one-quarter span. Let M<sub><i>c</i></sub> and
  M<sub><i>a</i></sub> be those moments. At a section distant <i>x</i> from
  the centre of a girder of span 2<i>c</i>, the bending moment due to a
  uniform load <i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> per ft run is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>M = ½<i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>(<i>c</i>-<i>x</i>)(<i>c</i>+<i>x</i>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Putting x = 0, for the centre section</p>

      <p>M<sub><i>c</i></sub> = ½<i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub><i>c</i><sup>2</sup>;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From these equations a value of <i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> can be
  obtained. Then the bridge is designed, so far as the direct stresses are
  concerned, for bending moments due to a uniform dead load and the uniform
  equivalent load <i>w</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>.</p>

  <p>27. <i>Influence Lines.</i>&mdash;In dealing with the action of
  travelling loads much assistance may be obtained by using a line termed
  an <i>influence line</i>. Such a line has for abscissa the distance of a
  load from one end of a girder, and for ordinate the bending moment or
  shear at any given section, or on any member, due to that load. Generally
  the influence line is drawn for unit load. In fig. 52 let
  A&prime;B&prime; be a girder supported at the ends and let it be required
  to investigate the bending moment at C&prime; due to unit load in any
  position on the girder. When the load is at F&prime;, the reaction at
  B&prime; is <i>m</i>/<i>l</i> and the moment at C&prime; is
  <i>m</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>l</i>, which will be reckoned positive,
  when it resists a tendency of the right-hand part of the girder to turn
  counter-clockwise. Projecting A&prime;F&prime;C&prime;B&prime; on to the
  horizontal AB, take F<i>f</i> = <i>m</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>l</i>, the
  moment at C of unit load at F. If this process is repeated for all
  positions of the load, we get the influence line AGB for the bending
  moment at C. The area AGB is termed the influence area. The greatest
  moment CG at C is <i>x</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>l</i>. To use this line
  to investigate the maximum moment at C due to a series of travelling
  loads at fixed distances, let P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>,
  P<sub>3</sub>, ... be the loads which at the moment considered are at
  distances <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, ... from the left
  abutment. Set off these distances along AB and let <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>,
  <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>, ... be the corresponding ordinates of the influence
  curve (<i>y</i> = F<i>f</i>) on the verticals under the loads. Then the
  moment at C due to all the loads is</p>

  <div class="poem">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 53.
  </div>
  <p>The position of the loads which gives the greatest moment at C may be
  settled by the criterion given above. For a uniform travelling load
  <i>w</i> per ft. of span, consider a small interval F<i>k</i> =
  &#x2206;<i>m</i> on which the load is <i>w</i>&#x2206;m. The moment due
  to this, at C, is <i>wm</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)&#x2206;<i>m</i>/<i>l</i>.
  But <i>m</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)&#x2206;<i>m</i>/<i>l</i> is the area of
  the strip F<i>fhk</i>, that is <i>y</i>&#x2206;<i>m</i>. Hence the moment
  of the load on &#x2206;<i>m</i> at C is <i>wy</i>&#x2206;<i>m</i>, and
  the moment of a uniform load over any portion of the girder is <i>w</i> ×
  the area of the influence curve under that portion. If the scales are so
  chosen that <i>a</i> inch represents 1 in. ton of moment, and <i>b</i>
  inch represents 1 ft. of span, and <i>w</i> is in tons per ft. run, then
  <i>ab</i> is the unit of area in measuring the influence curve.</p>

  <p>If the load is carried by a rail girder (stringer) with cross girders
  at the intersections of bracing and boom, its effect is distributed to
  the bracing intersections D&prime;E&prime; (fig. 53), and the part of the
  influence line for that bay (panel) is altered. With unit load in the
  position shown, the load at D&prime; is (<i>p</i>-<i>n</i>)/<i>p</i>, and
  that at E&prime; is <i>n</i>/<i>p</i>. The moment of the load at C is
  <i>m</i>(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>l</i>-<i>n</i>(<i>p</i>-<i>n</i>)/<i>p</i>.
  This is the equation to the dotted line RS (fig. 52).</p>

  <p>If the unit load is at F&prime;, the reaction at B&prime; and the
  shear at C&prime; is <i>m</i>/<i>l</i>, positive if the shearing stress
  resists a tendency of the part of the girder on the right to move
  upwards; set up F<i>f</i> = <i>m</i>/<i>l</i> (fig. 54) on the vertical
  under the load. Repeating the process for other positions, we get the
  influence line AGHB, for the shear at C due to unit load anywhere on the
  girder. GC = <i>x</i>/<i>l</i> and CH = -(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>l</i>.
  The lines AG, HB are parallel. If the load is in the bay D&prime;E&prime;
  and is carried by a rail girder which distributes it to cross girders at
  D&prime;E&prime;, the part of the influence line under this bay is
  altered. Let <i>n</i> (Fig. 55) be the distance of the load from
  D&prime;, <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> the distance of D&prime; from the left
  abutment, and <i>p</i> the length of a bay. The loads at D&prime;, E, due
  to unit weight on the rail girder are (<i>p</i>-<i>n</i>)/<i>p</i> and
  <i>n</i>/<i>p</i>. The reaction at B&prime; is
  {(<i>p</i>-<i>n</i>)<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>n</i>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>p</i>)}/<i>pl</i>.
  The shear at C&prime; is the reaction at B&prime; less the load at
  E&prime;, that is,
  {<i>p</i>(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>n</i>)-<i>nl</i>}/<i>pl</i>, which is
  the equation to the line DH (fig. 54). Clearly, the distribution of the
  load by the rail girder considerably alters the distribution of shear due
  to a load in the bay in which the section considered lies. The total
  shear due to a series of loads P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, ... at
  distances <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, ... from the left
  abutment, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>, ... being the
  ordinates of the influence curve under the loads, is S =
  P<sub>1</sub><i>y</i><sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub><i>y</i><sub>2</sub>+....
  Generally, the greatest shear S at C will occur when the longer of the
  segments into which C divides the girder is fully loaded and the other is
  unloaded, the leading load being at C. If the loads are very unequal or
  unequally spaced, a trial or two will determine which position gives the
  greatest value of S. The greatest shear at C&prime; of the opposite sign
  to that due to the loading of the longer segment occurs with the shorter
  segment loaded. For a uniformly distributed load <i>w</i> per ft. run the
  shear at C is <i>w</i> × the area of the influence curve under the
  segment covered by the load, attention being paid to the sign of the area
  of the curve. If the load rests directly on the main girder, the greatest
  + and - shears at C will be <i>w</i> × AGC and -<i>w</i> × CHB. But if
  the load is distributed to the bracing intersections by rail and cross
  girders, then the shear at C&prime; will be greatest when the load
  extends to N, and will have the values <i>w</i> × ADN and -<i>w</i> ×
  NEB. An interesting paper by F.C. Lea, dealing with the determination of
  stress due to concentrated loads, by the method of influence lines will
  be found in <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> clxi. p.261.</p>

  <p>28. <i>Eddy's Method.</i>&mdash;Another method of investigating the
  maximum shear at a section due to any distribution of a travelling load
  has been given by Prof. H.T. Eddy (<i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> xxii.,
  1890). Let <i>hk</i> (fig. 56) represent in magnitude and position a load
  W, at <i>x</i> from the left abutment, on a girder AB of span <i>l</i>.
  Lay off <i>kf</i>, <i>hg</i>, horizontal and equal to <i>l</i>. Join
  <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> to <i>h</i> and <i>k</i>. Draw verticals at A, B,
  and join <i>no</i>. Obviously <i>no</i> is horizontal and equal to
  <i>l</i>. Also <i>mn</i>/<i>mf</i> = <i>hk</i>/<i>kf</i> or
  <i>mn</i>-W(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>)/<i>l</i>, which is the reaction at A due
  to the load at C, and is the shear at any point of AC. Similarly,
  <i>po</i> is the reaction at B and shear at any point of CB. The shaded
  rectangles represent the distribution of shear due to the load at C,
  while <i>no</i> may be termed the datum line of shear. Let the load move
  to D, so that its distance from the left abutment is <i>x</i>+<i>a</i>.
  Draw a vertical at D, intersecting <i>fh</i>, <i>kg</i>, in <i>s</i> and
  <i>q</i>. Then <i>qr</i>/<i>ro</i> = <i>hk</i>/<i>hg</i> or <i>ro</i> =
  W(<i>l</i>-<i>x</i>-<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i>, which is the reaction at A and
  shear at any point of AD, for the new position of the load. Similarly,
  <i>rs</i> = W(<i>x</i>+<i>a</i>)/<i>l</i> is the shear on DB. The
  distribution of shear is given by the partially shaded rectangles. For
  the application of this method to a series of loads Prof. Eddy's paper
  must be referred to.</p>

  <p>29. <i>Economic Span.</i>&mdash;In the case of a bridge of many spans,
  there is a length of span which makes the cost of the bridge least. The
  cost of abutments and bridge flooring is practically independent of the
  length of span adopted. Let P be the cost of one pier; C the cost of the
  main girders for one span, erected; <i>n</i> the number of spans;
  <i>l</i> the length of one span, and L the length of the bridge between
  abutments. Then, <i>n</i> = L/<i>l</i> nearly. Cost of piers
  (<i>n</i>-1)P. Cost of main girders <i>n</i>G. The cost of a pier will
  not vary materially with the span adopted. It depends mainly on the
  character of the foundations and height at which the bridge is carried.
  The cost of the main girders for one span will vary nearly as the square
  of the span for any given type of girder and intensity of live load. That
  is, G = <i>al</i>², where <i>a</i> is a constant. Hence the total cost of
  that part of the bridge which varies with the span adopted is&mdash;</p>

  <p>The practical limit of span would be less than this. Professor Claxton
  Fidier (<i>Treatise on Bridge Construction</i>, 1887) has made a very
  careful theoretical analysis of the weights of bridges of different
  types, and has obtained the following values for the limiting spans. For
  parallel girders when <i>r</i> = 10, the limiting span is 1070 ft. For
  parabolic or bowstring girders, when <i>r</i> = 8, the limiting span is
  1280 ft. For flexible suspension bridges with wrought iron link chains,
  and dip = 1/10th of the span, the limiting span is 2800 ft. For stiffened
  suspension bridges with wire cables, if the dip is 1/10th of the span the
  limiting span is 2700 to 3600 ft., and if the dip is 1/8th of the span,
  3250 to 4250 ft., according to the factor of safety allowed.</p>

  <p>31. <i>Braced Girders.</i>&mdash;A frame is a rigid structure composed
  of straight struts and ties. The struts and ties are called bracing bars.
  The frame as a whole may be subject to a bending moment, but each member
  is simply extended or compressed so that the total stress on a given
  member is the same at all its cross sections, while the intensity of
  stress is uniform for all the parts of any one cross section. This result
  must follow in any frame, the members of which are so connected that the
  joints offer little or no resistance to change in the relative angular
  position of the members. Thus if the members are pinned together, the
  joint consisting of a single circular pin, the centre of which lies in
  the axis of the piece, it is clear that the direction of the only stress
  which can be transmitted from pin to pin will coincide with this axis.
  The axis becomes, therefore, a line of resistance, and in reasoning of
  the stresses on frames we may treat the frame as consisting of simple
  straight lines from joint to joint. It is found in practice that the
  stresses on the several members do not differ sensibly whether these
  members are pinned together with a single pin or more rigidly jointed by
  several bolts or rivets. Frames are much used as girders, and they also
  give useful designs for suspension and arched bridges. A frame used to
  support a weight is often called a <i>truss</i>; the stresses on the
  various members of a truss can be computed for any given load with
  greater accuracy than the intensity of stress on the various parts of a
  continuous structure such as a tubular girder, or the rib of an arch.
  Many assumptions are made in treating of the flexure of a continuous
  structure which are not strictly true; no assumption is made in
  determining the stresses on a frame except that the joints are flexible,
  and that the frame shall be so stiff as not sensibly to alter in form
  under the load. Frames used as bridge trusses should never be designed so
  that the elongation or compression of one member can elongate or compress
  any other member. An example will serve to make the meaning of this
  limitation clearer. Let a frame consist of the five members AB, BD, DC,
  CA, CB (fig. 57), jointed at the points A, B, C and D, and all capable of
  resisting tension and compression. This frame will be <i>rigid</i>, i.e.
  it cannot be distorted without causing an alteration in the length of one
  or more of the members; but if from a change of temperature or any other
  cause one or all of the members change their length, this will not
  produce a stress on any member, but will merely cause a change in the
  form of the frame. Such a frame as this cannot be <i>self-strained</i>. A
  workman, for instance, cannot produce a stress on one member by making
  some other member of a wrong length. Any error of this kind will merely
  affect the form of the frame; if, however, another member be introduced
  between A and D, then if BC be shortened AD will be strained so as to
  extend it, and the four other members will be compressed; if CB is
  lengthened AD will thereby be compressed, and the four other members
  extended; if the workman does not make CB and AD of exactly the right
  length they and all the members will be permanently strained. These
  stresses will be unknown quantities, which the designer cannot take into
  account, and such a combination should if possible be avoided. A frame of
  this second type is said to have one <i>redundant member</i>.</p>

  <p>In a three-span bridge continuous girders are lighter than
  discontinuous ones by about 45% for the dead load and 15% for the live
  load, if no allowance is made for ambiguity due to uncertainty as to the
  level of the supports. The cantilever and suspended girder types are as
  economical and free from uncertainty as to the stresses. In long-span
  bridges the cantilever system permits erection by building out, which is
  economical and sometimes necessary. It is, however, unstable unless
  rigidly fixed at the piers. In the Forth bridge stability is obtained
  partly by the great excess of dead over live load, partly by the great
  width of the river piers. The majority of bridges not of great span have
  girders with parallel booms. This involves the fewest difficulties of
  workmanship and perhaps permits the closest approximation of actual to
  theoretical dimensions of the parts. In spans over 200 ft. it is
  economical to have one horizontal boom and one polygonal (approximately
  parabolic) boom. The hog-backed girder is a compromise between the two
  types, avoiding some difficulties of construction near the ends of the
  girder.</p>

  <p>Most braced girders may be considered as built up of two simple forms
  of truss, the king-post truss (fig. 61, <i>a</i>), or the queen-post
  truss (fig. 61, <i>b</i>). These may be used in either the upright or the
  inverted position. A <i>multiple truss</i> consists of a number of simple
  trusses, e.g. Bollman truss. Some timber bridges consist of queen-post
  trusses in the upright position, as shown diagrammatically in fig. 62,
  where the circles indicate points at which the flooring girders transmit
  load to the main girders. <i>Compound</i> trusses consist of simple
  trusses used as primary, secondary and tertiary trusses, the secondary
  supported on the primary, and the tertiary on the secondary. Thus, the
  Fink truss consists of king-post trusses; the Pratt truss (fig. 63) and
  the Whipple truss (fig. 64) of queen-post trusses alternately upright and
  inverted.</p>

  <p>A combination bridge is built partly of timber, partly of steel, the
  compression members being generally of timber and the tension members of
  steel. On the Pacific coast, where excellent timber is obtainable and
  steel works are distant, combination bridges are still largely used
  (Ottewell, <i>Trans. Am. Soc. C.E.</i> xxvii. p. 467). The combination
  bridge at Roseburgh, Oregon, is a cantilever bridge, <!-- Page 555

  shore arms are 147 ft. span, the river arms 105 ft., and the suspended
  girder 80 ft., the total distance between anchor piers being 584 ft. The
  floor beams, floor and railing are of timber. The compression members are
  of timber, except the struts and bottom chord panels next the river
  piers, which are of steel. The tension members are of iron and the pins
  of steel. The chord blocks and post shoes are of cast-iron.</p>

  <p>33. <i>Graphic Method of finding the Stresses in Braced
  Structures.</i>&mdash;Fig. 65 shows a common form of bridge truss known
  as a <i>Warren girder</i>, with lines indicating external forces applied
  to the joints; half the load carried between the two lower joints next
  the piers on either side is directly carried by the abutments. The sum of
  the two upward vertical reactions must clearly be equal to the sum of the
  loads. The lines in the diagram represent the directions of a series of
  forces which must all be in equilibrium; these lines may, for an object
  to be explained in the next paragraph, be conveniently named by the
  letters in the spaces which they separate instead of by the method
  usually employed in geometry. Thus we shall call the first inclined line
  on the left hand the line AG, the line representing the first force on
  the top left-hand joint AB, the first horizontal member at the top left
  hand the line BH, &amp;c; similarly each point requires at least three
  letters to denote it; the top first left-hand joint may be called ABHG,
  being the point where these four spaces meet. In this method of
  lettering, every enclosed space must be designated by a letter; all
  external forces must be represented by lines <i>outside</i> the frame,
  and each space between any two forces must receive a distinctive letter;
  this method of lettering was first proposed by O. Henrici and R. H. Bow
  (<i>Economics of Construction</i>), and is convenient in applying the
  theory of reciprocal figures to the computation of stresses on
  frames.</p>

  <p>34. <i>Reciprocal Figures.</i>&mdash;J. Clerk Maxwell gave (<i>Phil.
  Mag. 1864</i>) the following definition of reciprocal figures:&mdash;"Two
  plane figures are reciprocal when they consist of an equal number of
  lines so that corresponding lines in the two figures are parallel, and
  corresponding lines which converge to a point in one figure form a closed
  polygon in the other."</p>

  <p>Let a frame (without redundant members), and the external forces which
  keep it in equilibrium, be represented by a diagram constituting one of
  these two plane figures, then the lines in the other plane figure or the
  reciprocal will represent in direction and magnitude the forces between
  the joints of the frame, and, consequently, the stress on each member, as
  will now be explained.</p>

  <p>Reciprocal figures are easily drawn by following definite rules, and
  afford therefore a simple method of computing the stresses on members of
  a frame.</p>

  <p>The external forces on a frame or bridge in equilibrium under those
  forces may, by a well-known proposition in statics, be represented by a
  closed polygon, each side of which is parallel to one force, and
  represents the force in magnitude as well as in direction. The sides of
  the polygon may be arranged in any order, provided care is taken so to
  draw them that in passing round the polygon in one direction this
  direction may for each side correspond to the direction of the force
  which it represents.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 66.
  </div>
  <p>This polygon of forces may, by a slight extension of the above
  definition, be called the <i>reciprocal figure</i> of the external
  forces, if the sides are arranged in the same order as that of the joints
  on which they act, so that if the joints and forces be numbered 1, 2, 3,
  4, &amp;c., passing round the outside of the frame in one direction, and
  returning at last to joint 1, then in the polygon the side representing
  the force 2 will be next the side representing the force 1, and will be
  followed by the side representing the force 3, and so forth. This polygon
  falls under the definition of a reciprocal figure given by Clerk Maxwell,
  if we consider the frame as a point in equilibrium under the external
  forces.</p>

  <p>Fig. 66 shows a frame supported at the two end joints, and loaded at
  each top joint. The loads and the supporting forces are indicated by
  arrows. Fig. 67a shows the reciprocal figure or polygon for the external
  forces on the assumption that the reactions are slightly inclined. The
  lines in fig. 67 <i>a</i>, lettered in the usual manner, correspond to
  the forces indicated by arrows in fig. 66, and lettered according to
  Bow's method. When all the forces are vertical, as will be the case in
  girders, the polygon of external forces will be reduced to two straight
  lines, fig. 67 <i>b</i>, superimposed and divided so that the length AX
  represents the load AX, the length AB the load AB, the length YX the
  reaction YX, and so forth. The line XZ consists of a series of lengths,
  as XA, AB ... DZ, representing the loads taken in their order. In
  subsequent diagrams the two reaction lines will, for the sake of
  clearness, be drawn as if slightly inclined to the vertical.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 67.
  </div>
  <p>If there are no redundant members in the frame there will be only two
  members abutting at the point of support, for these two members will be
  sufficient to balance the reaction, whatever its direction may be; we can
  therefore draw two triangles, each having as one side the reaction YX,
  and having the two other sides parallel to these two members; each of
  these triangles will represent a polygon of forces in equilibrium at the
  point of support. Of these two triangles, shown in fig. 67 <i>c</i>,
  select that in which the letters X and Y are so placed that (naming the
  apex of the triangle E) the lines XE and YE are the lines parallel to the
  two members of the same name in the frame (fig. 66). Then the triangle
  YXE is the reciprocal figure of the three lines YX, XE, EY in the frame,
  and represents the three forces in equilibrium at the point YXE of the
  frame. The direction of YX, being a thrust upwards, shows the direction
  in which we must go round the triangle YXE to find the direction of the
  two other forces; doing this we find that the force XE must act down
  towards the point YXE, and the force EY away from the same point. Putting
  arrows on the frame diagram to indicate the direction of the forces, we
  see that the member EY must pull and therefore act as a tie, and that the
  member XE must push and act as a strut. Passing to the point XEFA we find
  two known forces, the load XA acting downwards, and a push from the strut
  XE, which, being in compression, must push at both ends, as indicated by
  the arrow, fig. 66. The directions and magnitudes of these two forces are
  already drawn (fig. 67 <i>a</i>) in a fitting position to represent part
  of the polygon of forces at XEFA; beginning with the upward thrust EX,
  continuing down XA, and drawing AF parallel to AF in the frame we
  complete the polygon by drawing EF parallel to EF in the frame. The point
  F is determined by the intersection of the two lines, one beginning at A,
  and the other at E. We then have the polygon of forces EXAF, the
  reciprocal figure of the lines meeting at that point in the frame, and
  representing the forces at the point EXAF; the direction of the forces on
  EH and XA being known determines the direction of the forces due to the
  elastic reaction of the members AF and EF, showing AF to push as a strut,
  while EF is a tie. We have been guided in the selection of the particular
  quadrilateral adopted by the rule of arranging the order of the sides so
  that the same letters indicate corresponding sides in the diagram of the
  frame and its reciprocal. Continuing the construction of the diagram in
  the same way, we arrive at fig. 67 <i>d</i> as the complete reciprocal
  figure of the frame and forces upon it, and we see that each line in the
  reciprocal figure measures the stress on the corresponding member in the
  frame, and that the polygon of forces acting at any point, as IJKY, in
  the frame is represented by a polygon of the same name in the reciprocal
  <!-- Page 556 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page556"></a>[v.04
  p.0556]</span>figure. The direction of the force in each member is easily
  ascertained by proceeding in the manner above described. A single known
  force in a polygon determines the direction of all the others, as these
  must all correspond with arrows pointing the same way round the polygon.
  Let the arrows be placed on the frame round each joint, and so as to
  indicate the direction of each force on that joint; then when two arrows
  point to one another on the same piece, that piece is a tie; when they
  point from one another the piece is a strut. It is hardly necessary to
  say that the forces exerted by the two ends of any one member must be
  equal and opposite. This method is universally applicable where there are
  no redundant members. The reciprocal figure for any loaded frame is a
  complete formula for the stress on every member of a frame of that
  particular class with loads on given joints.</p>

  the method of reciprocal figures, and the method of influence lines is

  <p>35. <i>Chain Loaded uniformly along a Horizontal Line.</i>&mdash;If
  the lengths of the links be assumed indefinitely short, the chain under
  given simple distributions of load will take the form of comparatively
  simple mathematical curves known as catenaries. The true catenary is that
  assumed by a chain of uniform weight per unit of length, but the form
  generally adopted for suspension bridges is that assumed by a chain under
  a weight uniformly distributed relatively to a horizontal line. This
  curve is a parabola.</p>

  <p>Remembering that in this case the centre bending moment &sum;<i>wl</i>
  will be equal to <i>w</i>L²/8, we see that the horizontal tension H at
  the vertex for a span L (the points of support being at equal heights) is
  given by the expression</p>

  the bent beam. Then the deviation y = DE of the neutral axis of the bent
  beam at any point D from the axis OX is given by the relation</p>

  <p>where M is the bending moment and I the amount of inertia of the beam
  at D, and E is the coefficient of elasticity. It is usually accurate
  enough in deflection calculations to take for I the moment of inertia at
  the centre of the beam and to consider it constant for the length of the
  beam. Then</p>

  per inch length M = <i>w</i>(<i>a</i>²-<i>x</i>²), where <i>a</i> is the

  <p>37. <i>Graphic Method of finding Deflection.</i>&mdash;Divide the span
  L into any convenient number <i>n</i> of equal parts of length <i>l</i>,
  so that <i>nl</i> = L; compute the radii of curvature R<sub>1</sub>,
  R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> for the several sections. Let measurements
  along the beam be represented according to any convenient scale, so that
  calling L<sub>1</sub> and <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> the lengths to be drawn on
  paper, we have L = <i>a</i>L<sub>1</sub>; now let <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>,
  <i>r</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>3</sub> be a series of radii such that
  <i>r</i><sub>1</sub> = R<sub>1</sub>/<i>ab</i>, <i>r</i><sub>2</sub> =
  R<sub>2</sub>/<i>ab</i>, &amp;c., where <i>b</i> is any convenient
  constant chosen of such magnitude as will allow arcs with the radii,
  <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., to be drawn with the
  means at the draughtsman's disposal. Draw a curve <!-- Page 557 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page557"></a>[v.04 p.0557]</span>as shown in
  fig. 72 with arcs of the length <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>,
  <i>l</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>l</i><sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., and with the radii
  <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. (note, for a length
  ½<i>l</i><sub>1</sub> at each end the radius will be infinite, and the
  curve must end with a straight line tangent to the last arc), then let
  <i>v</i> be the measured deflection of this curve from the straight line,
  and V the actual deflection of the bridge; we have V =
  <i>av</i>/<i>b</i>, approximately. This method distorts the curve, so
  that vertical ordinates of the curve are drawn to a scale <i>b</i> times
  greater than that of the horizontal ordinates. Thus if the horizontal
  scale be one-tenth of an inch to the foot, <i>a</i> = 120, and a beam 100
  ft. in length would be drawn equal to 10 in.; then if the true radius at
  the centre were 10,000 ft., this radius, if the curve were undistorted,
  would be on paper 1000 in., but making <i>b</i> = 50 we can draw the
  curve with a radius of 20 in. The vertical distortion of the curve must
  not be so great that there is a very sensible difference between the
  length of the arc and its chord. This can be regulated by altering the
  value of <i>b</i>. In fig. 72 distortion is carried too far; this figure
  is merely used as an illustration.</p>

  <p>38. <i>Camber.</i>&mdash;In order that a girder may become straight
  under its working load it should be constructed with a camber or upward
  convexity equal to the calculated deflection. Owing to the yielding of
  joints when a beam is first loaded a smaller modulus of elasticity should
  be taken than for a solid bar. For riveted girders E is about 17,500,000
  lb per sq. in. for first loading. W.J.M. Rankine gives the approximate
  rule</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGET, SAINT,</b> more properly <span class="sc">Brigid</span>
  (c. 452-523), one of the patron saints of Ireland, was born at Faughart
  in county Louth, her father being a prince of Ulster. Refusing to marry,
  she chose a life of seclusion, making her cell, the first in Ireland,
  under a large oak tree, whence the place was called Kil-dara, "the church
  of the oak." The city of Kildare is supposed to derive its name from St
  Brigid's cell. The year of her death is generally placed in 523. She was
  buried at Kildare, but her remains were afterwards translated to
  Downpatrick, where they were laid beside the bodies of St Patrick and St
  Columba. Her feast is celebrated on the 1st of February. A large
  collection of miraculous stories clustered round her name, and her
  reputation was not confined to Ireland, for, under the name of St Bride,
  she became a favourite saint in England, and numerous churches were
  dedicated to her in Scotland.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGET,</b> <span class="sc">Brigitta, Birgitta,</span> <b>OF
  SWEDEN, SAINT</b> (c. 1302-1373), the most celebrated saint of the
  northern kingdoms, was the daughter of Birger Persson, governor and
  <i>lagman</i> (provincial judge) of Uppland, and one of the richest
  landowners of the country. In 1316 she was married to Ulf Gudmarson, lord
  of Nericia, to whom she bore eight children, one of whom was afterwards
  honoured as St Catherine of Sweden. Bridget's saintly and charitable life
  soon made her known far and wide; she gained, too, great religious
  influence over her husband, with whom (1341-1343) she went on pilgrimage
  to St James of Compostella. In 1344, shortly after their return, Ulf died
  in the Cistercian monastery of Alvastra in East Gothland, and Bridget now
  devoted herself wholly to religion. As a child she had already believed
  herself to have visions; these now became more frequent, and her records
  of these "revelations," which were translated into Latin by Matthias,
  canon of Linköping, and by her confessor, Peter, prior of Alvastra,
  obtained a great vogue during the middle ages. It was about this time
  that she founded the order of St Saviour, or Bridgittines (<i>q.v.</i>),
  of which the principal house, at Vadstena, was richly endowed by King
  Magnus II. and his queen. About 1350 she went to Rome, partly to obtain
  from the pope the authorization of the new order, partly in pursuance of
  her self-imposed mission to elevate the moral tone of the age. It was not
  till 1370 that Pope Urban V. confirmed the rule of her order; but
  meanwhile Bridget had made herself universally beloved in Rome by her
  kindness and good works. Save for occasional pilgrimages, including one
  to Jerusalem in 1373, she remained in Rome till her death on the 23rd of
  July 1373. She was canonized in 1391 by Pope Boniface IX., and her feast
  is celebrated on the 9th of October.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGETON,</b> a city, port of entry, and the county-seat of
  Cumberland county, New Jersey, U.S.A., in the south part of the state, on
  Cohansey creek, 38 m. S. of Philadelphia. Pop. (1890) 11,424; (1900)
  13,913, of whom 653 were foreign-born and 701 were negroes; (1905)
  13,624; (1910) 14,209. It is served by the West Jersey &amp; Sea Shore
  and the Central of New Jersey railways, by electric railways connecting
  with adjacent towns, and by Delaware river steamboats on Cohansey creek,
  which is navigable to this point. It is an attractive residential city,
  has a park of 650 acres and a fine public library, and is the seat of
  West Jersey academy and of Ivy Hall, a school for girls. It is an
  important market town and distributing centre for a rich agricultural
  region; among its manufactures are glass (the product, chiefly glass
  bottles, being valued in 1905 at $1,252,795&mdash;42.3% of the value of
  all the city's factory products&mdash;and Bridgeton ranking eighth among
  the cities of the United States in this industry), machinery, clothing,
  and canned fruits and vegetables; it also has dyeing and finishing works.
  Though Bridgeton is a port of entry, its foreign commerce is relatively
  unimportant. The first settlement in what is now Bridgeton was made
  toward the close of the 18th century. A pioneer iron-works was
  established here in 1814. The city of Bridgeton, formed by the union of
  the township of Bridgeton and the township of Cohansey (incorporated in
  1845 and 1848 respectively), was chartered in 1864.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGETT, THOMAS EDWARD</b> (1829-1899), Roman Catholic priest and
  historical writer, was born at Derby on the 20th of January 1829. He was
  brought up a Baptist, but in his sixteenth year joined the Church of
  England. In 1847 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, with the
  intention of taking orders. Being unable to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine
  Articles he could not take his degree, and in 1850 became a Roman
  Catholic, soon afterwards joining the Congregation of the Redemptorists.
  He went through his novitiate at St Trond in Belgium, and after a course
  of five years of theological study at Wittem, in Holland, was ordained
  priest. He returned to England in 1856, and for over forty years led an
  active life as a missioner in England and Ireland, preaching in over 80
  missions and 140 retreats to the <!-- Page 558 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page558"></a>[v.04 p.0558]</span>clergy and to
  nuns. His stay in Limerick was particularly successful, and he founded a
  religious confraternity of laymen which numbered 5000 members. Despite
  his arduous life as a priest, Bridgett found time to produce literary
  works of value, chiefly dealing with the history of the Reformation in
  England; among these are <i>The Life of Blessed John Fisher, Bishop of
  Rochester</i> (1888); <i>The Life and Writings of Sir Thomas More</i>
  (1890); <i>History of the Eucharist in Great Britain</i> (2 vols., 1881);
  <i>Our Lady's Dowry</i> (1875, 3rd ed. 1890). He died at Clapham on the
  17th of February 1899.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGEWATER, FRANCIS EGERTON</b>, <span class="sc">3rd Duke
  of</span> (1736-1803), the originator of British inland navigation,
  younger son of the 1st duke, was born on the 21st of May 1736. Scroop,
  1st duke of Bridgewater (1681-1745), was the son of the 3rd earl of
  Bridgewater, and was created a duke in 1720; he was the great-grandson of
  John Egerton, 1st earl of Bridgewater (d. 1649; cr. 1617), whose name is
  associated with the production of Milton's <i>Comus</i>; and the latter
  was the son of Sir Thomas Egerton (1540-1617), Queen Elizabeth's lord
  keeper and James I.'s lord chancellor, who was created baron of Ellesmere
  in 1603, and in 1616 Viscount Brackley (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

  <p>Francis Egerton succeeded to the dukedom at the age of twelve on the
  death of his brother, the 2nd duke. As a child he was sickly and of such
  unpromising intellectual capacity that at one time the idea of cutting
  the entail was seriously entertained. Shortly after attaining his
  majority he became engaged to the beautiful duchess of Hamilton, but her
  refusal to give up the acquaintance of her sister, Lady Coventry, led to
  the breaking off of the match. Thereupon the duke broke up his London
  establishment, and retiring to his estate at Worsley, devoted himself to
  the making of canals. The navigable canal from Worsley to Manchester
  which he projected for the transport of the coal obtained on his estates
  was (with the exception of the Sankey canal) the first great undertaking
  of the kind executed in Great Britain in modern times. The construction
  of this remarkable work, with its famous aqueduct across the Irwell, was
  carried out by James Brindley, the celebrated engineer. The completion of
  this canal led the duke to undertake a still more ambitious work. In 1762
  he obtained parliamentary powers to provide an improved waterway between
  Liverpool and Manchester by means of a canal. The difficulties
  encountered in the execution of the latter work were still more
  formidable than those of the Worsley canal, involving, as they did, the
  carrying of the canal over Sale Moor Moss. But the genius of Brindley,
  his engineer, proved superior to all obstacles, and though at one period
  of the undertaking the financial resources of the duke were almost
  exhausted, the work was carried to a triumphant conclusion. The untiring
  perseverance displayed by the duke in surmounting the various
  difficulties that retarded the accomplishment of his projects, together
  with the pecuniary restrictions he imposed on himself in order to supply
  the necessary capital (at one time he reduced his personal expenses to
  £400 a year), affords an instructive example of that energy and
  self-denial on which the success of great undertakings so much depends.
  Both these canals were completed when the duke was only thirty-six years
  of age, and the remainder of his life was spent in extending them and in
  improving his estates; and during the latter years of his life he derived
  a princely income from the success of his enterprise. Though a steady
  supporter of Pitt's administration, he never took any prominent part in
  politics.</p>

  <p>He died unmarried on the 8th of March 1803, when the ducal title
  became extinct, but the earldom of Bridgewater passed to a cousin, John
  William Egerton, who became 7th earl. By his will he devised his canals
  and estates on trust, under which his nephew, the marquess of Stafford
  (afterwards first duke of Sutherland), became the first beneficiary, and
  next his son Francis Leveson Gower (afterwards first earl of Ellesmere)
  and his issue. In order that the trust should last as long as possible,
  an extraordinary use was made of the legal rule that property may be
  settled for the duration of lives in being and twenty-one years after, by
  choosing a great number of persons connected with the duke and their
  living issue and adding to them the peers who had taken their seats in
  the House of Lords on or before the duke's decease. Though the last of
  the peers died in 1857, one of the commoners survived till the 19th of
  October 1883, and consequently the trust did not expire till the 19th of
  October 1903, when the whole property passed under the undivided control
  of the earl of Ellesmere. The canals, however, had in 1872 been
  transferred to the Bridgewater Navigation Company, by whom they were sold
  in 1887 to the Manchester Ship Canal Company.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGEWATER, FRANCIS HENRY EGERTON,</b> <span class="sc">8th Earl
  of</span> (1756-1829), was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford,
  and became fellow of All Souls in 1780, and F.R.S. in 1781. He held the
  rectories of Middle and Whitchurch in Shropshire, but the duties were
  performed by a proxy. He succeeded his brother (see above) in the earldom
  in 1823, and spent the latter part of his life in Paris. He was a fair
  scholar, and a zealous naturalist and antiquarian. When he died in
  February 1829 the earldom became extinct. He bequeathed to the British
  Museum the valuable Egerton MSS. dealing with the literature of France
  and Italy, and also £12,000. He also left £8000 at the disposal of the
  president of the Royal Society, to be paid to the author or authors who
  might be selected to write and publish 1000 copies of a treatise "On the
  Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation." Mr
  Davies Gilbert, who then filled the office, selected eight persons, each
  to undertake a branch of this subject, and each to receive £1000 as his
  reward, together with any benefit that might accrue from the sale of his
  work, according to the will of the testator.</p>

  <p>The Bridgewater treatises were published as follows:&mdash;1. <i>The
  Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Condition of
  Man</i>, by Thomas Chalmers, D.D. 2. <i>The Adaptation of External Nature
  to the Physical Condition of Man</i>, by John Kidd, M.D. 3. <i>Astronomy

  apologetic literature. They first appeared during the years 1833 to 1840,
  and afterwards in Bohn's Scientific Library.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGITTINES,</b> an order of Augustinian canonesses founded by St
  Bridget of Sweden (<i>q.v.</i>) <i>c.</i> 1350, and approved by Urban V.
  in 1370. It was a "double order," each convent having attached to it a
  small community of canons to act as chaplains, but under the government
  of the abbess. The order spread widely in Sweden and Norway, and played a
  remarkable part in promoting culture and literature in Scandinavia; to
  this is to be attributed the fact that the head house at Vastein, by Lake
  Vetter, was not suppressed till 1595. There were houses also in other
  lands, so that the total number amounted to 80. In England, the famous
  Bridgittine convent of Syon at Isleworth, Middlesex, was founded and
  royally endowed by Henry V. in 1415, and became one of the richest and
  most fashionable and influential nunneries in the country. It was among
  the few religious houses restored in Mary's reign, when nearly twenty of
  the old community were re-established at Syon. On Elizabeth's accession
  they migrated to the Low Countries, and thence, after many vicissitudes,
  to Rouen, and finally in 1594 to Lisbon. Here they remained, always
  recruiting their numbers from England, till 1861, when they returned to
  England. Syon House is now established at Chudleigh in Devon, the only
  English community that can boast an unbroken conventual existence since
  pre-Reformation times. Some six other Bridgittine convents exist on the
  Continent, but the order is now composed only of women.</p>

  grand-daughter of Joseph Downer, one of the five first settlers (1761) of
  Thetford, Vermont. Laura was a delicate infant, puny and rickety, and was
  subject to fits up to twenty months old, but otherwise seemed to have
  normal senses; at two years, however, she had a very bad attack of
  scarlet fever, which destroyed sight and hearing, blunted the sense of
  smell, and left her system a wreck. Though she gradually recovered health
  she remained a blind deaf-mute, but was kindly treated and was in
  particular made a sort of playmate by an eccentric bachelor friend of the
  Bridgmans, Mr Asa Tenney, who as soon as she could walk used to take her
  for rambles a-field. In 1837 Mr James Barrett, of Dartmouth College, saw
  her and mentioned her case to Dr Mussey, the head of the medical
  department, who wrote an account which attracted the attention of Dr S.G.
  Howe (<i>q.v.</i>), the head of the Perkins Institution for the Blind at
  Boston. He determined to try to get the child into the Institution and to
  attempt to educate her; her parents assented, and in October 1837 Laura
  entered the school. Though the loss of her eye-balls occasioned some
  deformity, she was otherwise a comely child and of a sensitive and
  affectionate nature; she had become familiar with the world about her,
  and was imitative in so far as she could follow the actions of others;
  but she was limited in her communication with others to the narrower uses
  of touch&mdash;patting her head meant approval, rubbing her hand
  disapproval, pushing one way meant to go, drawing another to come. Her
  mother, preoccupied with house-work, had already ceased to be able to
  control her, and her father's authority was due to fear of superior
  force, not to reason. Dr Howe at once set himself to teach her the
  alphabet by touch. It is impossible, for reasons of space, to describe
  his efforts in detail. He taught words before the individual letters, and
  his first experiment consisting in pasting upon several common articles
  such as keys, spoons, knives, &amp;c., little paper labels with the names
  of the articles printed in raised letters, which he got her to feel and
  differentiate; then he gave her the same labels by themselves, which she
  learnt to associate with the articles they referred to, until, with the
  spoon or knife alone before her she could find the right label for each
  from a mixed heap. The next stage was to give her the component letters
  and teach her to combine them in the words she knew, and gradually in
  this way she learnt all the alphabet and the ten digits, &amp;c. The
  whole process depended, of course, on her having a human intelligence,
  which only required stimulation, and her own interest in learning became
  keener as she progressed. On the 24th of July 1839 she first wrote her
  own name legibly. Dr Howe devoted himself with the utmost patience and
  assiduity to her education and was rewarded by increasing success. On the
  20th of June 1840 she had her first arithmetic lesson, by the aid of a
  metallic case perforated with square holes, square types being used; and
  in nineteen days she could add a column of figures amounting to thirty.
  She was in good health and happy, and was treated by Dr Howe as his
  daughter. Her case already began to interest the public, and others were
  brought to Dr Howe for treatment. In 1841 Laura began to keep a journal,
  in which she recorded her own day's work and thoughts. In January 1842
  Charles Dickens visited the Institution, and afterwards wrote
  enthusiastically in <i>American Notes</i> of Dr Howe's success with
  Laura. In 1843 funds were obtained for devoting a special teacher to her,
  and first Miss Swift, then Miss Wight, and then Miss Paddock, were
  appointed; Laura by this time was learning geography and elementary
  astronomy. By degrees she was given religious instruction, but Dr Howe
  was intent upon not inculcating dogma before she had grasped the
  essential moral truths of Christianity and the story of the Bible. She
  grew up a gay, cheerful girl, loving, optimistic, but with a nervous
  system inclining to irritability, and requiring careful education in
  self-control. In 1860 her eldest sister Mary's death helped to bring on a
  religious crisis, and through the influence of some of her family she was
  received into the Baptist church; she became for some years after this
  more self-conscious and rather pietistic. In 1867 she began writing
  compositions which she called poems; the best-known is called "Holy
  Home." In 1872, Dr Howe having been enabled to build some separate
  cottages (each under a matron) for the blind girls, Laura was moved from
  the larger house of the Institution into one of them, and there she
  continued her quiet life. The death of Dr Howe in 1876 was a great grief
  to her; but before he died he had made arrangements by which she would be
  financially provided for in her home at the Institution for the rest of
  her life. In 1887 her jubilee was celebrated there, but in 1889 she was
  taken ill, and she died on the 24th of May. She was buried at Hanover.
  Her name has become familiar everywhere as an example of the education of
  a blind deaf-mute, leading to even greater results in Helen Keller.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGNORTH,</b> a market town and municipal borough in the Ludlow
  parliamentary division of Shropshire, England, 150 m. N.W. by W. from
  London by the Great Western railway, on the Worcester-Shrewsbury line.
  Pop. (1901) 6052. The river Severn separates the upper town on the right
  bank from the lower on the left. A steep line of rail connects them. The
  upper town is built on the acclivities and summit of a rock which rises
  abruptly from the river to the height of 180 ft., and gives the town a
  very picturesque appearance. The railway passes under by a long tunnel.
  On the summit is the tower of the old castle, leaning about 17° from the
  perpendicular. There are also two parish churches. That of St Leonard,
  formerly collegiate, was practically rebuilt in 1862. This parish was
  held by Richard Baxter, the famous divine, in 1640. St Mary's church is
  in classic style of the late 18th century. The picturesque half-timbered
  style of domestic building is frequently seen in the streets. In this
  style are the town hall (1652), and a house dated 1580, in which was born
  in 1729 Thomas Percy, bishop of Dromore, the editor of the <i>Reliques of
  Ancient English Poetry</i>. The grammar school, founded in 1503, occupies
  an Elizabethan building; there are also a college of divinity, a
  blue-coat school, and a literary institute with library and school of
  art. There are large charities. Near the town is a curious ancient
  hermitage cave, in the sandstone. At Quatford, 1 m. south-east, the site
  of a castle dating from 1085 may be traced. This dominated the ancient
  Forest of Morf. Here Robert de Belesme originally founded the college
  which was afterwards moved to Bridgnorth. Bridgnorth manufactures
  carpets; brewing is carried on, and there is trade in agricultural
  produce. The town is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.
  Area, 3018 acres.</p>

  <p>The early history of Bridgnorth is connected with Æthelfleda, lady of
  the Mercians, who raised a mound there in 912 as part of her offensive
  policy against the Danes of the five boroughs. After the Conquest William
  I. granted the manor of Bridgnorth to Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, whose son
  Robert de Belesme transferred his castle and borough from Quatford to
  Bridgnorth, but on Robert's attainder in 1102 the town became a royal
  borough. It is probable that Henry I. granted the burgesses certain
  privileges, for Henry II. confirmed to them all the franchises and
  customs which they had in the time of Henry I. King John in 1215 granted
  them freedom from toll throughout England except the city of London, and
  in <!-- Page 560 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page560"></a>[v.04
  p.0560]</span>1227 Henry III. conferred several new rights and liberties,
  among which were a gild merchant with a hanse. These early charters were
  confirmed by several succeeding kings, Henry VI. granting in addition
  assize of bread and ale and other privileges. Bridgnorth was incorporated
  by James I. in 1546. The burgesses returned two members to parliament in
  1295, and continued to do so until 1867, when they were assigned only one
  member. The town was disfranchised in 1885. A yearly fair on the feast of
  the Translation of St Leonard and three following days was granted to the
  burgesses in 1359, and in 1630 Charles I. granted them licence to hold
  another fair on the Thursday before the first week in Lent and two
  following days.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDGWATER,</b> a market town, port and municipal borough in the
  Bridgwater parliamentary division of Somerset, England, on the river
  Parret, 10 m. from its mouth, and 151¾ m. by the Great Western railway W.
  by S. of London. Pop. (1901) 15,209. It is pleasantly situated in a level
  and well-wooded country, having on the east the Mendip range and on the
  west the Quantock hills. The town lies along both sides of the river,
  here crossed by a handsome iron bridge. Among several places of worship
  the chief is St Mary Magdalene's church; this has a north porch and
  windows dating from the 14th century, besides a lofty and slender spire;
  but it has been much altered by restoration. It possesses a fine painted
  reredos. A house in Blake Street, largely restored, was the birthplace of
  Admiral Blake in 1598. Near the town are the three fine old churches of
  Weston Zoyland, Chedzoy and Middlezoy, containing some good brasses and
  carved woodwork. The battlefield of Sedgemoor, where the Monmouth
  rebellion was finally crushed in 1685, is within 3 m.; while not far off
  is Charlinch, the home of the Agapemonites (<i>q.v.</i>). Bridgwater has
  a considerable coasting trade, importing grain, coal, wine, hemp, tallow
  and timber, and exporting Bath brick, farm produce, earthenware, cement
  and plaster of Paris. The river is navigable by vessels of 700 tons,
  though liable, when spring-tides are flowing, to a bore which rises, in
  rough weather, to a height of 9 ft. Bath brick, manufactured only here,
  and made of the mingled sand and clay deposited by every tide, is the
  staple article of commerce; iron-founding is also carried on. The town is
  governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 926 acres.</p>

  <p>A settlement probably grew up in Saxon times at Bridgwater
  (<i>Briges</i>, <i>Briggewalteri</i>, <i>Brigewauter</i>), owing its
  origin as a trade centre to its position at the mouth of the chief river
  in Somerset. It became a mesne borough by the charter granted by John in
  1201, which provided that the town should be a free borough, the
  burgesses to be free and quit of all tolls, and made William de Briwere
  overlord. Other charters were granted by Henry III. in 1227 (confirmed in
  1318, 1370, 1380), which gave Bridgwater a gild merchant. It was
  incorporated by charter of Edward IV. (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586,
  1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation began in 1295 and continued
  until the Reform Act of 1870. A Saturday market and a fair on the 24th of
  June were granted by the charter of 1201. Another fair at the beginning
  of Lent was added in 1468, and a second market on Thursday, and fairs at
  Midsummer and on the 21st of September were added in 1554. Charles II.
  granted another fair on the 29th of December. The medieval importance of
  these markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine and later of cloth
  has gone. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction
  of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for
  centuries.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDLINGTON,</b> a market town, municipal borough and seaside
  resort in the Buckrose parliamentary division of the East Riding of
  Yorkshire, England, 31 m. N.N.E. from Hull by a branch of the North
  Eastern railway. Pop. (1891) 8919; (1901) 12,482. It is divided into two
  parts, the ancient market town lying about 1 m. from the coast, while the
  modern houses of Bridlington Quay, the watering-place, fringe the shore
  of Bridlington Bay. Southward the coast becomes low, but northward it is
  steep and very fine, where the great spur of Flamborough Head
  (<i>q.v.</i>) projects eastward. In the old town of Bridlington the
  church of St Mary and St Nicholas consists of the fine Decorated and
  Perpendicular nave, with Early English portions, of the priory church of
  an Augustinian foundation of the time of Henry I. There remains also the
  Perpendicular gateway, serving as the town-hall. The founder of the
  priory was Walter de Gaunt, about 1114, and the institution flourished
  until 1537, when the last prior was executed for taking part in the
  Pilgrimage of Grace. A Congregational society was founded in 1662, and
  its old church, dating from 1702, stood until 1906. At Bridlington Quay
  there is excellent sea-bathing, and the parade and ornamental gardens
  provide pleasant promenades. Extensive works have been carried out along
  the sea front. There is a chalybeate spring. The harbour is enclosed by
  two stone piers, and there is good anchorage in the bay. The municipal
  borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors, and has an area
  of 2751 acres.</p>

  <p>The mention of four burgesses at Bridlington (Brellington, Burlington)
  in the Domesday survey shows it to have been a borough before the
  Conquest. With the rest of the north of England, Bridlington suffered
  from the ravages of the Normans, and decreased in value from £32 in the
  reign of Edward the Confessor, when it formed part of the possessions of
  Earl Morcar, to 8s. at the time of the Domesday survey. By that time it
  was in the hands of the king by the forfeiture of Earl Morcar. It was
  granted by William II. to Gilbert de Gaunt, whose son and heir Walter
  founded the priory and endowed it with the manor of Bridlington and other
  lands. From this date the importance of the town steadily increased.
  Henry I. and several succeeding kings confirmed Walter de Gaunt's gift,
  Stephen granting in addition the right to have a port. In 1546 Henry IV.
  granted the prior and convent exemption from fifteenths, tenths and
  subsidies, in return for prayer for himself and his queen in every mass
  sung at the high altar. After the Dissolution the manor remained with the
  crown until 1624, when Charles I. granted it to Sir John Ramsey, whose
  brother and heir, Sir George Ramsey, sold it in 1633 to thirteen
  inhabitants of the town on behalf of all the tenants of the manor. The
  thirteen lords were assisted by twelve other inhabitants chosen by the
  freeholders, and when the number of lords was reduced to six, seven
  others were chosen from the assistants. A chief lord was chosen every
  year. This system still holds good. It is evident from the fact of
  thirteen inhabitants being allowed to hold the manor that the town had
  some kind of incorporation in the 17th century, although its
  incorporation charter was not granted until 1899, when it was created a
  municipal borough. In 1200 King John granted the prior of Bridlington a
  weekly market on Saturday and an annual fair on the vigil, feast and
  morrow of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Henry VI. in 1446 granted
  the prior three new fairs yearly on the vigil, day and morrow of the
  Nativity of the Virgin Mary, the Deposition of St John, late prior of
  Bridlington, and the Translation of the same St John. All fairs and
  markets were sold with the manor to the inhabitants of the town.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDPORT, ALEXANDER HOOD,</b> <span class="sc">Viscount</span>
  (1727-1814), British admiral, was the younger brother of Samuel, Lord
  Hood, and cousin of Sir Samuel and Captain Alexander Hood. Entering the
  navy in January 1741, he was appointed lieutenant of the "Bridgewater"
  six years later, and in that rank served for ten years in various ships.
  He was then posted to the "Prince," the flag-ship of Rear-Admiral
  Saunders (under whom Hood had served as a lieutenant) and in this command
  served in the Mediterranean for some time. Returning home, he was
  appointed to the "Minerva" frigate, in which he was present at Hawke's
  great victory in Quiberon Bay (20th November 1759). In 1761 the "Minerva"
  recaptured, after a long struggle, the "Warwick" of equal force, and
  later in the same year Captain Alexander Hood went in the "Africa" to the
  Mediterranean, where he served until the conclusion of peace. From this
  time forward he was in continuous employment afloat and ashore, and in
  the "Robust" was present at the battle of Ushant in 1778. Hood was
  involved in the court-martial on Admiral (afterwards Viscount) Keppel
  which followed this action, and although adverse popular feeling was
  aroused by the course which he took in Keppel's defence, his conduct does
  not seem to have injured his professional career. Two years later he was
  made rear-admiral of the white, and succeeded Kempenfeldt as one of
  Howe's flag-officers, and in the "Queen" (90) he was present at the
  relief of Gibraltar in 1782. For a time he sat in the House of Commons.
  Promoted vice-admiral in 1787, he became K.B. in the following year, and
  on the occasion of the Spanish armament in 1790 flew his flag again for a
  short time. On the outbreak of the war with France in 1793 Sir Alexander
  Hood once more went to sea, this time as Howe's second in command, and he
  had his share in the operations which culminated in the "Glorius First of
  June," and for his services was made Baron Bridport of Cricket St Thomas
  in Somerset <!-- Page 561 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page561"></a>[v.04 p.0561]</span>in the Irish peerage. Henceforth
  Bridport was practically in independent command. In 1795 he fought the
  much-criticized partial action of the 23rd of June off Belle-Ile, which,
  however unfavourably it was regarded in some quarters, was counted as a
  great victory by the public. Bridport's peerage was made English, and he
  became vice-admiral of England. In 1796-1797 he practically directed the
  war from London, rarely hoisting his flag afloat save at such critical
  times as that of the Irish expedition in 1797. In the following year he
  was about to put to sea when the Spithead fleet mutinied. He succeeded at
  first in pacifying the crew of his flag-ship, who had no personal grudge
  against their admiral, but a few days later the mutiny broke out afresh,
  and this time was uncontrollable. For a whole week the mutineers were
  supreme, and it was only by the greatest exertions of the old Lord Howe
  that order was then restored and the men returned to duty. After the
  mutiny had been suppressed, Bridport took the fleet to sea as
  commander-in-chief in name as well as in fact, and from 1798 to 1800
  personally directed the blockade of Brest, which grew stricter and
  stricter as time went on. In 1800 he was relieved by St Vincent, and
  retired from active duty after fifty-nine years' service. In reward for
  his fine record his peerage was made a viscounty. He spent the remaining
  years of his life in retirement. He died on the 2nd of May 1814. The
  viscounty in the English peerage died with him; the Irish barony passed
  to the younger branch of his brother's family, for whom the viscounty was
  recreated in 1868.</p>

  <p><b>BRIDPORT,</b> a market town and municipal borough in the Western
  parliamentary division of Dorsetshire, England, 18 m. N.W. of Dorchester,
  on a branch of the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 5710. It is
  pleasantly situated in a hilly district on the river Brit, from which it
  takes its name. The main part of the town is about a mile from the sea,
  with which it is connected by a winding street, ending at a quay
  surrounded by the fishing village of West Bay, where the railway
  terminates. The church of St Mary is a handsome cruciform Perpendicular
  building. The harbour is accessible only to small vessels. There is some
  import trade in flax, timber and coal. The principal articles of
  manufacture have long been sailcloth, cordage, linen and fishing-nets.
  The municipal borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors.
  Area, 593 acres.</p>

  <p>Bridport was evidently of some importance before the Conquest, when it
  consisted of 120 houses rated for all the king's services and paying geld
  for five hides. By 1086 the number of houses had decreased to 100, and of
  these 20 were in such a wretched condition that they could not pay geld.
  The town is first mentioned as a borough in the Pipe Roll of 1189, which
  states that William de Bendenges owed £9: 10s. for the ancient farm of
  Bridport, and that the men of the town owed tallage to the amount of 53s.
  10d. Henry III. granted the first charter in 1252-1253, making the town a
  free borough and granting the burgesses the right to hold it at the
  ancient fee farm with an increase of 40s., and to choose two bailiffs to
  answer at the exchequer for the farm. A deed of 1381 shows that Henry
  III. also granted the burgesses freedom from toll. Bridport was
  incorporated by James I. in 1619, but Charles II. granted a new charter
  in 1667, and by this the town was governed until 1835. The first existing
  grant of a market and fairs to Bridport is dated 1593, but it appears
  from the <i>Quo Warranto</i> Rolls that Edward I. possessed a market
  there. The town was noted for the manufacture of ropes and cables as
  early as 1213, and an act of parliament (21 Henry VIII.) shows that the
  inhabitants had "from time out of mind" made the cables, ropes and
  hawsers for the royal navy and for most of the other ships. Bridport was
  represented in parliament by two members from 1395 to 1867. In the latter
  year the number was reduced to one, and in 1885 the town was
  disfranchised.</p>

  <p><b>BRIE</b> (<i>Briegus saltus</i>, from Celtic <i>briek</i>, clay),
  an agricultural district of northern France, to the E. of Paris, bounded
  W. and S. by the Seine, N. by the Marne. It has an area of 2400 sq. m.,
  comprising the greater part of the department of Seine-et-Marne, together
  with portions of the departments of Seine, Seine-et-Oise, Aisne, Marne
  and Aube. The western portion was known as the <i>Brie française</i>, the
  eastern portion as the <i>Brie champenoise</i>. The Brie forms a plateau
  with few eminences, varying in altitude between 300 and 500 ft. in the
  west, and between 500 and 650 ft. in the east. Its scenery is varied by
  forests of some size&mdash;the chief being the Forêt de Senart, the Forêt
  de Crécy and the Forêt d'Armainvilliers. The surface soil is clay in
  which are embedded fragments of siliceous sandstone, used for millstones
  and constructional purposes; the subsoil is limestone. The Yères, a
  tributary of the Seine, and the Grand Morin and Petit Morin, tributaries
  of the Marne, are the chief rivers, but the region is not abundantly
  watered and the rainfall is only between 20 and 24 in. The Brie is famous
  for its grain and its dairy products, especially cheeses.</p>

  <p><b>BRIEF</b> (Lat. <i>brevis</i>, short), in English legal practice,
  the written statement given to a barrister to form the basis of his case.
  It was probably so called from its at first being only a copy of the
  original writ. Upon a barrister devolves the duty of taking charge of a
  case when it comes into court, but all the preliminary work, such as the
  drawing up of the case, serving papers, marshalling evidence, &amp;c., is
  performed by a solicitor, so that a brief contains a concise summary for
  the information of counsel of the case which he has to plead, with all
  material facts in chronological order, and frequently such observations
  thereon as the solicitor may think fit to make, the names of witnesses,
  with the "proofs," that is, the nature of the evidence which each witness
  is ready to give, if called upon. The brief may also contain suggestions
  for the use of counsel when cross-examining witnesses called by the other
  side. Accompanying the brief may be copies of the pleadings (see <span
  class="sc">Pleading</span>), and of all documents material to the case.
  The brief is always endorsed with the title of the court in which the
  action is to be tried, with the title of the action, and the names of the
  counsel and of the solicitor who delivers the brief. Counsel's fee is
  also marked. The delivery of a brief to counsel gives him authority to
  act for his client in all matters which the litigation involves. The
  result of the action is noted on the brief by counsel, or if the action
  is compromised, the terms of the compromise are endorsed on each brief
  and signed by the leading counsel on the opposite side. In Scotland a
  brief is called a memorial.</p>

  <p>In the United States the word has, to a certain extent, a different
  meaning, a brief in its English sense not being required, for the
  American attorney exercises all the functions distributed in England
  between barristers and solicitors. A lawyer sometimes prepares for his
  own use what is called a "trial brief" for use at the trial. This
  corresponds in all essential particulars with the "brief" prepared by the
  solicitor in England for the use of counsel. But the more distinctive use
  of the term in America is in the case of the brief "in error or appeal,"
  before an appellate court. This is a written or printed document, varying
  according to circumstances, but embodying the argument on the question
  affected. Most of the appellate courts require the filing of printed
  briefs for the use of the court and opposing counsel at a time designated
  for each side before hearing. In the rules of the United States Supreme
  Court and circuit courts of appeals the brief is required to contain a
  concise statement of the case, a specification of errors relied on,
  including the substance of evidence, the admission or rejection of which
  is to be reviewed, or any extract from a charge excepted to, and an
  argument exhibiting clearly the points of law or fact to be discussed.
  This form of brief, it may be added, is also adopted for use at the trial
  in certain states of the Union which require printed briefs to be
  delivered to the court.</p>

  <p>In English ecclesiastical law a brief meant letters patent issued out
  of chancery to churchwardens or other officers for the collection of
  money for church purposes. Such briefs were regulated by a statute of
  1704, but are now obsolete, though they are still to be found named in
  one of the rubrics in the Communion service of the Book of Common
  Prayer.</p>

  <p>The <i>brief-bag</i>, in which counsel's papers are carried to and
  from court, now forms an integral part of a barrister's outfit, but in
  the early part of the 19th century the possession of a brief-bag was
  strictly confined to those who had received one from a king's counsel.
  King's counsel were then few in number, were considered officers of the
  court, and had a salary of £40 a year, with a supply of paper, pens and
  purple bags. These bags they distributed among rising juniors of their
  acquaintance, <!-- Page 562 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page562"></a>[v.04 p.0562]</span>whose bundles of briefs were
  getting inconveniently large to be carried in their hands. These
  perquisites were abolished in 1830. English brief-bags are now either
  blue or red. Blue bags are those with which barristers provide themselves
  when first called, and it is a breach of etiquette to let this bag be
  visible in court. The only brief-bag allowed to be placed on the desks is
  the red bag, which by English legal etiquette is given by a leading
  counsel to a junior who has been useful to him in some important
  case.</p>

  <p><b>BRIEG,</b> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Silesia,
  on the left bank of the Oder, and on the Breslau and Beuthen railway, 27
  m. S.E. of the former city. Pop. (1900) 24,090. It has a castle (the
  residence of the old counts of Brieg), a lunatic asylum, a gymnasium with
  a good library, several churches and hospitals, and a theatre. Its
  fortifications were destroyed by the French in 1807, and are now replaced
  by beautiful promenades. Brieg carries on a considerable trade, its chief
  manufactures being linen, embroideries, cotton and woollen goods,
  ribbons, leather, machinery, hats, pasteboard and cigars. Important
  cattle-markets are held here. Brieg, or, as it is called in early
  documents, <i>Civitas Altae Ripae</i>, obtained municipal rights in 1250
  from Duke Henry III. of Breslau, and was fortified in 1297; its name is
  derived from the Polish <i>Brzeg</i> (shore). Burned by the Hussites in
  1428, the town was soon afterwards rebuilt, and in 1595 it was again
  fortified by Joachim Frederick, duke of Brieg. In the Thirty Years' War
  it suffered greatly; in that of the Austrian succession it was heavily
  bombarded by the Prussian forces; and in 1807 it was captured by the
  French and Bavarians. From 1311 to 1675 Brieg was the capital of an
  independent line of dukes, a cadet branch of the Polish dukes of Lower
  Silesia, by one of whom the castle was built in 1341. In 1537 Frederick
  II., duke of Liegnitz, Brieg and Wohlau, concluded with Joachim II.,
  elector of Brandenburg, a treaty according to which his duchy was to pass
  to the house of Brandenburg in the event of the extinction of his line.
  On the death of George William the last duke in 1675, however, Austria
  refused to acknowledge the validity of the treaty and annexed the
  duchies. It was the determination of Frederick II. of Prussia to assert
  his claim that led in 1740 to the war that ended two years later in the
  cession of Silesia to Prussia.</p>

  <p><b>BRIEG,</b> often now spelt <span class="sc">Brig</span> (Fr.
  <i>Brigue</i>, Ital. <i>Briga</i>), a picturesque small town in the Swiss
  canton of the Valais, situated at the foot of the northern slope of the
  Simplon Pass, on the right bank of the Saltine stream, and a little above
  its junction with the Rhone. Its older houses are very Italian in
  appearance, while its most prominent buildings (castle, former Jesuits'
  college and Ursuline convent) all date from the 17th century, and are due
  to the generosity of a single member of the local Stockalper family. The
  prosperity of Brieg is bound up with the Simplon Pass (<i>q.v.</i>), so
  that it gradually supplanted the more ancient village of Naters opposite,
  becoming a separate parish (the church is at Glis, a few minutes from the
  town) in 1517. Its medieval name was <i>Briga dives</i>. The opening of
  the carriage road across the Simplon (1807) and of the tunnel beneath the
  pass (1906), as well as the fact that above Brieg is the steeper and less
  fertile portion of the Upper Valais (now much frequented by tourists),
  have greatly increased the importance and size of the town. The opening
  of the railway tunnel beneath the Lötschen Pass, affording direct
  communication with Bern and the Bernese Oberland, is calculated still
  further to contribute to its prosperity. The new town extends below the
  old one and is closer to the right bank of the Rhone. In 1900 the
  population was 2182, almost all Romanists, while 1316 were
  German-speaking, 719 Italian-speaking (the Simplon tunnel workmen), and
  142 French-speaking, one person only speaking Romonsch.</p>

  <p><b>BRIELLE</b> (<i>Briel</i> or <i>Bril</i>), a seaport in the
  province of South Holland, Holland, on the north side of the island of
  Voorne, at the mouth of the New Maas, 5½ m. N. of Hellevoetsluis. Pop.
  (1900) 4107. It is a fortified place and has a good harbour, arsenal,
  magazine and barracks. It also possesses a quaint town hall, and an
  orphanage dating from 1533. The tower of the Groote Kerk of St Catherine
  serves as a lighthouse. Most of the trade of Brielle was diverted to
  Hellevoetsluis by the cutting of the Voornsche Canal in 1829, but it
  still has some business in corn and fodder, as well as a few factories. A
  large number of the inhabitants are also engaged in the fisheries and as
  pilots.</p>

  <p>The chief event in the history of Brielle is its capture by the
  <i>Gueux sur Mer</i>, a squadron of privateers which raided the Dutch
  coast under commission of the prince of Orange. This event, which took
  place on the 1st of April 1572, was the first blow in the long war of
  Dutch independence, and was followed by a general outbreak of the
  patriotic party (Motley, <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>, part iii.
  chapter vi.). "The Brill" was one of the four Dutch towns handed over to
  Queen Elizabeth in 1584 as security for English expenses incurred in
  aiding the Dutch. Brielle is the birthplace of the famous admiral Martin
  van Tromp, and also of Admiral van Almonde, a distinguished commander of
  the early 18th century.</p>

  <p><b>BRIENNE-LE-CHÂTEAU,</b> a town of north-eastern France, in the
  department of Aube, 1 m. from the right bank of the Aube and 26 m. N.E.
  of Troyes on the Eastern railway. Pop. (1906) 1761. The château, which
  overlooks the town, is an imposing building of the latter half of the
  18th century, built by the cardinal de Brienne (see below). It possesses
  an important collection of pictures, many of them historical portraits of
  the 17th and 18th centuries. The church dates from the 16th century and
  contains good stained glass. A statue of Napoleon commemorates his
  sojourn at Brienne from 1779 to 1784, when he was studying at the
  military school suppressed in 1790. In 1814 Brienne was the scene of
  fighting between Napoleon and the Allies (see <span class="sc">Napoleonic
  Campaigns</span>). Brewing is carried on in the town. Brienne-la-Vieille,
  a village 1½ m. south of Brienne-le-Château, has a church of the 12th and
  16th centuries with fine stained windows. The portal once belonged to the
  ancient abbey of Bassefontaine, the ruins of which are situated near the
  village.</p>

  <p><i>Counts of Brienne.</i>&mdash;Under the Carolingian dynasty
  Brienne-le-Château was the capital town of a French countship. In the
  10th century it was captured by two adventurers named Engelbert and
  Gobert, and from the first of these sprang the noble house of Brienne. In
  1210 John of Brienne (1148-1237) became king of Jerusalem, through his
  marriage with Mary of Montsserrat, heiress of the kingdom of Jerusalem.
  He led a crusade in Egypt which had no lasting success; and when in 1229
  he was elected emperor of the East, for the period of Baldwin II.'s
  minority, he fought and conquered the Greek emperor John III. (Batatzes
  or Vatatzes). Walter V., count of Brienne and of Lecce (Apulia) and duke
  of Athens, fought against the Greeks and at first drove them from
  Thessaly, but was eventually defeated and killed near Lake Copais in
  1311. His son, Walter VI., after having vainly attempted to reconquer
  Athens in 1331, served under Philip of Valois against the English. Having
  defended Florence against the Pisans he succeeded in obtaining
  dictatorial powers for himself in the republic; but his tyrannical
  conduct brought about his expulsion. He was appointed constable of France
  by John the Good, and was killed at the battle of Poitiers in 1356. His
  sister and heiress Isabelle married Walter of Enghien, and so brought
  Brienne to the house of Enghien, and, by his marriage with Margaret of
  Enghien, John of Luxemburg-St Pol (d. about 1397) became count of
  Brienne. The house of Luxemburg retained the countship until Margaret
  Charlotte of Luxemburg sold it to a certain Marpon, who ceded it to Henri
  Auguste de Loménie (whose wife, Louise de Béon, descended from the house
  of Luxemburg-Brienne) in 1640. The Limousin house of Loménie (the
  genealogies which trace this family to the 15th century are
  untrustworthy) produced many well-known statesmen, among others the
  celebrated cardinal Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne (1727-1794),
  minister of Louis XV.; and the last lords of Brienne were members of this
  family.</p>

  <p><b>BRIENZ, LAKE OF,</b> in the Swiss canton of Bern, the first lake
  into which the river Aar expands. It lies in a deep hollow between the
  village of Brienz on the east (2580 inhabitants, the <!-- Page 563
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page563"></a>[v.04 p.0563]</span>chief
  centre of the Swiss wood-carving industry) and, on the west, Bönigen
  (1515 inhabitants), close to Interlaken. Its length is about 9 m., its
  width 1½ m., and its maximum depth 856 ft., while its area is 11½ sq. m.,
  and the surface is 1857 ft. above the sea-level. On the south shore are
  the Giessbach Falls and the hamlet of Iseltwald. On the north shore are a
  few small villages. The character of the lake is gloomy and sad as
  compared with its neighbour, that of Thun. Its chief affluent is the
  Lütschine (flowing from the valleys of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen).
  The first steamer was placed on the lake in 1839.</p>

  <p><b>BRIERLEY, BENJAMIN</b> (1825-1896), English weaver and writer in
  Lancashire dialect, was born near Manchester, the son of humble parents,
  and started life in a textile factory, educating himself in his spare
  time. At about the age of thirty he began to contribute articles to local
  papers, and the republication of some of his sketches of Lancashire
  character in <i>A Summer Day in Daisy Nook</i> (1859) attracted
  attention. In 1863 he definitely took to journalism and literature as his
  work, publishing in 1863 his <i>Chronicles of Waverlow</i>, and in 1864 a
  long story called <i>The Layrock of Langley Side</i> (afterwards
  dramatized), followed by others. He started in 1869 <i>Ben Brierley's
  Journal</i>, a weekly, which continued till 1891, and he gave public
  readings from his own writings, visiting America in 1880 and 1884. His
  various <i>Ab-o'-th'-Yate</i> sketches (about America, London, &amp;c.),
  and his pictures of Lancashire common life were very popular, and were
  collected after his death. In 1884 he lost his savings by the failure of
  a building society, and a fund was raised for his support. He died on the
  18th of January 1896, and two years later a statue was erected to him in
  Queen's Park, Manchester.</p>

  <p><b>BRIERLY, SIR OSWALD WALTERS</b> (1817-1894), English marine
  painter, who came of an old Cheshire family, was born at Chester. He
  entered Sass's art-school in London, and after studying naval
  architecture at Plymouth he exhibited some drawings of ships at the Royal
  Academy in 1839. He had a passion for the sea, and in 1841 started round
  the world with Benjamin Boyd (1796-1851), afterwards well known as a
  great Australian squatter, in the latter's ship "Wanderer," and having
  got to New South Wales, made his home at Auckland for ten years. Brierly
  Point is called after him. He added to his sea experiences by voyages on
  H.M.S. "Rattlesnake" in 1848, and with Sir Henry Keppel on the "Meander"
  in 1850; he returned to England in 1851 on this ship, and illustrated
  Keppel's book about his cruise (1853). He was again with Keppel during
  the Crimean War, and published in 1855 a series of lithographs
  illustrating "The English and French fleets in the Baltic." He was now
  taken up by Queen Victoria and other members of the royal family, and was
  attached to the suites of the duke of Edinburgh and the prince of Wales
  on their tours by sea, the results being seen in further marine pictures
  by him; and in 1874 he was made marine-painter to the queen. He exhibited
  at the Academy, but more largely at the Royal Water-colour Society, his
  more important works including the historical pictures, "The Retreat of
  the Spanish Armada" (1871) and "The Loss of the Revenge" (1877). In 1885
  he was knighted, and he died on the 14th of December 1894. He was twice
  married and had an active and prosperous life, but was no great artist;
  his best pictures are at Melbourne and Sydney.</p>

  <p><b>BRIEUX, EUGÈNE</b> (1858- ), French dramatist, was born in Paris of
  poor parents on the 19th of January 1858. A one-act play, <i>Bernard
  Palissy</i>, written in collaboration with M. Gaston Salandri, was
  produced in 1879, but he had to wait eleven years before he obtained
  another hearing, his <i>Ménage d' artistes</i> being produced by Antoine
  at the Théâtre Libre in 1890. His plays are essentially didactic, being
  aimed at some weakness or iniquity of the social system.
  <i>Blanchette</i> (1892) pointed out the evil results of education of
  girls of the working classes; <i>M. de Réboval</i> (1892) was directed
  against pharisaism; <i>L'Engrenage</i> (1894) against corruption in
  politics; <i>Les Bienssaiteurs</i> (1896) against the frivolity of
  fashionable charity; and <i>L'Évasion</i> (1896) satirized an
  indicriminate belief in the doctrine of heredity. <i>Les Trois Filles de
  M. Dupont</i> (1897) is a powerful, somewhat brutal, study of the
  miseries imposed on poor middle-class girls by the French system of
  dowry; <i>Le Résultat des courses</i> (1898) shows the evil results of
  betting among the Parisian workmen; <i>La Robe rouge</i> (1900) was
  directed against the injustices of the law; <i>Les Remplaçantes</i>
  (1901) against the practice of putting children out to nurse. <i>Les
  Avariés</i> (1901), forbidden by the censor, on account of its medical
  details, was read privately by the author at the Théâtre Antoine; and
  <i>Petite amie</i> (1902) describes the life of a Parisian shop-girl.
  Later plays are <i>La Couvée</i> (1903, acted privately at Rouen in
  1893), <i>Maternité</i> (1904), <i>La Déserteuse</i> (1904), in
  collaboration with M. Jean Sigaux, and <i>Les Hannetons</i>, a comedy in
  three acts (1906).</p>

  <p><b>BRIGADE</b> (Fr. and Ger. <i>brigade</i>, Ital. <i>brigata</i>,
  Span. <i>brigada</i>; the English use of the word dates from the early
  17th century), a unit in military organization commanded by a
  major-general, brigadier-general or colonel, and composed of two or more
  regiments of infantry, cavalry or artillery. The British infantry brigade
  consists as a rule of four battalions (or about 4000 bayonets) with
  supply, transport and medical units attached; the cavalry brigade of two
  or three regiments of cavalry. An artillery "brigade" (field, horse, and
  heavy) is in Great Britain a smaller unit, forming a lieut.-colonel's
  command and consisting of two or three batteries. (See <span
  class="sc">Army, Artillery, Infantry</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Cavalry</span>.) The staff of an infantry or cavalry brigade
  usually consists of the brigadier commanding, his aide-de-camp, and the
  brigade-major, a staff officer whose duties are intermediate between
  those of an adjutant and those of a general staff officer.</p>

  <p><b>BRIGANDAGE.</b> The brigand is supposed to derive his name from the
  O. Fr. <i>brigan</i>, which is a form of the Ital. <i>brigante,</i> an
  irregular or partisan soldier. There can be no doubt as to the origin of
  the word "bandit," which has the same meaning. In Italy, which is not
  unjustly considered the home of the most accomplished European brigands,
  a <i>bandito</i> was a man declared outlaw by proclamation, or
  <i>bando</i>, called in Scotland "a decree of horning" because it was
  delivered by a blast of a horn at the town cross. The brigand, therefore,
  is the outlaw who conducts warfare after the manner of an irregular or
  partisan soldier by skirmishes and surprises, who makes the war support
  itself by plunder, by extorting blackmail, by capturing prisoners and
  holding them to ransom, who enforces his demands by violence, and kills
  the prisoners who cannot pay. In certain conditions the brigand has not
  been a mere malefactor. "It is you who are the thieves"&mdash;"<i>I
  Ladroni, siete voi,</i>"&mdash;was the defence of the Calabrian who was
  tried as a brigand by a French court-martial during the reign of Murat in
  Naples. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last
  resource of a people subject to invasion. The Calabrians who fought for
  Ferdinand of Naples, and the Spanish irregular levies, which maintained
  the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called
  brigands by their enemies. In the Balkan peninsula, under Turkish rule,
  the brigands (called <i>klephts</i> by the Greeks and <i>hayduks</i> or
  <i>haydutzi</i> by the Slavs) had some claim to believe themselves the
  representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to
  an attempt to maintain order was the permission given to part of the
  population to carry arms in order to repress the klephts. They were hence
  called "armatoli." As a matter of fact the armatole were rather the
  allies than the enemies of the klephts. The invader who reduces a nation
  to anarchy, and then suffers from the disorder he creates, always calls
  his opponents brigands. It is a natural consequence of such a war, but a
  very disastrous one, for the people who have to have recourse to these
  methods of defence, that the brigand acquires some measure of honourable
  prestige from his temporary association with patriotism and honest men.
  The patriot band attracts the brigand proper, who is not averse to
  continue his old courses under an honourable pretext. "<i>Viva Fernando y
  vamos robando</i>" (Long life to Ferdinand, and let us go robbing) has
  been said by not unfair critics to have been the maxim of many Spanish
  guerrilleros. Italy and Spain suffered for a long time from the disorder
  developed out of the popular resistance to the French. Numbers of the
  guerrilleros of both countries, who in normal conditions might have been
  honest, had acquired a preference <!-- Page 564 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page564"></a>[v.04 p.0564]</span>for living on
  the country, and for occasional booty, which they could not resign when
  the enemy had retired. Their countrymen had to work for a second
  deliverance from their late defenders. In the East the brigand has had a
  freer scope, and has even founded kingdoms. David's following in the cave
  of Adullam was such material as brigands are made of. "And every one that
  was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was
  discontented, gathered themselves unto him, and he became a captain over
  them: and there were with him about four hundred men." Nadir Shah of
  Persia began in just such a cave of Adullam, and lived to plunder Delhi
  with a host of Persians and Afghans.</p>

  <p>The conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be
  easily summed up. They are first bad administration, and then, in a less
  degree, the possession of convenient hiding-places. A country of mountain
  and forest is favourable to the brigand. The highlands of Scotland
  supplied a safe refuge to the "gentlemen reavers," who carried off the
  cattle of the Sassenach landlords. The Apennines, the mountains of
  Calabria, the Sierras of Spain, were the homes of the Italian "banditos"
  and the Spanish "bandoleros" (banished men) and "salteadores" (raiders).
  The forests of England gave cover to the outlaws whose very much
  flattered portrait is to be found in the ballads of Robin Hood. The
  "maquis," i.e. the bush of Corsica, and its hills, have helped the
  Corsican brigand, as the bush of Australia covered the bushranger. But
  neither forest thicket nor mountain is a lasting protection against a
  good police, used with intelligence by the government, and supported by
  the law-abiding part of the community. The great haunts of brigands in
  Europe have been central and southern Italy and the worst-administered
  parts of Spain, except those which fell into the hands of the Turks.
  "Whenever numerous troops of banditti, multiplied by success and
  impunity, publicly defy, instead of eluding, the justice of their
  country, we may safely infer that the excessive weakness of the
  government is felt and abused by the lowest ranks of the community," is
  the judgment passed by Gibbon on the disorders of Sicily in the reign of
  the emperor Gallienus. This weakness has not always been a sign of real
  feebleness in the government. England was vigorously ruled in the reign
  of William III., when "a fraternity of plunderers, thirty in number
  according to the lowest estimate, squatted near Waltham Cross under the
  shades of Epping Forest, and built themselves huts, from which they
  sallied forth with sword and pistol to bid passengers stand." It was not
  because the state was weak that the Gubbings (so called in contempt from
  the trimmings and refuse of fish) infested Devonshire for a generation
  from their headquarters near Brent Tor, on the edge of Dartmoor. It was
  because England had not provided herself with a competent rural police.
  In relatively unsettled parts of the United States there has been a
  considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage. In early days the
  travel routes to the far West were infested by highwaymen, who, however,
  seldom united into bands, and such outlaws, when captured, were often
  dealt with in an extra-legal manner, e.g. by "vigilance committees." The
  Mexican brigand Cortina made incursions into Texas before the Civil War.
  In Canada the mounted police have kept brigandage down, and in Mexico the
  "Rurales" have made an end of the brigands. Such curable evils as the
  highwaymen of England, and their like in the States, are not to be
  compared with the "Écorcheurs," or Skinners, of France in the 15th
  century, or the "Chauffeurs" of the revolutionary epoch. The first were
  large bands of discharged mercenary soldiers who pillaged the country.
  The second were ruffians who forced their victims to pay ransom by
  holding their feet in fires. Both flourished because the government was
  for the time disorganized by foreign invasion or by revolution. These
  were far more terrible evils than the licence of criminals, who are
  encouraged by a fair prospect of impunity because there is no permanent
  force always at hand to check them, and to bring them promptly to
  justice. At the same time it would be going much too far to say that the
  absence of an efficient police is the sole cause of brigandage in
  countries not subject to foreign invasion, or where the state is not very
  feeble. The Sicilian peasants of whom Gibbon wrote were not only
  encouraged by the hope of impunity, but were also maddened by an
  oppressive system of taxation and a cruel system of land tenure. So were
  the Gauls and Spaniards who throughout the 3rd and 4th centuries were a
  constant cause of trouble to the empire, under the name of Bagaudae, a
  word of uncertain origin. In the years preceding the French Revolution,
  the royal government commanded the services of a strong army, and a
  numerous <i>maréchaussée</i> or gendarmerie. Yet it was defied by the
  troops of smugglers and brigands known as <i>faux saulniers</i>,
  unauthorized salt-sellers, and gangs of poachers haunted the king's
  preserves round Paris. The salt monopoly and the excessive preservation
  of the game were so oppressive that the peasantry were provoked to
  violent resistance and to brigandage. They were constantly suppressed,
  but as the cause of the disorder survived, so its effects were
  continually renewed. The offenders enjoyed a large measure of public
  sympathy, and were warned or concealed by the population, even when they
  were not actively supported. The traditional outlaw who spared the poor
  and levied tribute on the rich was, no doubt, always a creature of
  fiction. The ballad which tells us how "Rich, wealthy misers were
  abhorred, By brave, free-hearted Bliss" (a rascal hanged for highway
  robbery at Salisbury in 1695) must have been a mere echo of the Robin
  Hood songs. But there have been times and countries in which the law and
  its administration have been so far regarded as enemies by people who
  were not themselves criminals, that all who defied them have been sure of
  a measure of sympathy. Then and there it was that brigandage has
  flourished, and has been difficult to extirpate. Schinder-Hannes, Jack
  the Skinner, whose real name was Johann Buckler, and who was born at
  Muklen on the Rhine, flourished from 1797 to 1802 because there was no
  proper police to stop him; it is also true that as he chiefly plundered
  the Jews he had a good deal of Christian sympathy. When caught and
  beheaded he had no successors.</p>

  <p>The brigandage of Greece, southern Italy, Corsica and Spain had deeper
  roots, and has never been quite suppressed. All four countries are well
  provided with hiding-places in forest and mountain. In all the
  administration has been bad, the law and its officers have been regarded
  as dangers, if not as deliberate enemies, so that they have found little
  native help, and, what is not the least important cause of the
  persistence of brigandage, there have generally been local potentates who
  found it to their interest to protect the brigand. The case of Greece
  under Turkish rule need not be dealt with. Whoever was not a klepht was
  the victim of some official extortioner. It would be grossly unfair to
  apply the name brigand to the Mainotes and similar clans, who had to
  choose between being flayed by the Turks or living by the sword under
  their own law. When it became independent Greece was extremely ill
  administered under a nominal parliamentary government by politicians who
  made use of the brigands for their own purposes. The result was the state
  of things described with only pardonable exaggeration in Edmond About's
  amusing <i>Roi de la montagne</i>. An authentic and most interesting
  picture of the Greek brigands will be found in the story of the captivity
  of S. Soteropoulos, an ex-minister who fell into their hands. It was
  translated into English under the title of <i>The Brigands of the
  Morea</i>, by the Rev. J.O. Bagdon (London, 1868). The misfortunes of
  Soteropoulos led to the adoption of strong measures which cleared the
  Morea, where the peasantry gave active support to the troops when they
  saw that the government was in earnest. But brigandage was not yet
  extinct in Greece. In 1870 an English party, consisting of Lord and Lady
  Muncaster, Mr Vyner, Mr Lloyd, Mr Herbert, and Count de Boyl, was
  captured at Oropos, near Marathon, and a ransom of £25,000 was demanded.
  Lord and Lady Muncaster were set at liberty to seek for the ransom, but
  the Greek government sent troops in pursuit of the brigands, and the
  other prisoners were then murdered. The scoundrels were hunted down,
  caught, and executed, and Greece has since then been tolerably free from
  this reproach. In the Balkan peninsula, under Turkish rule, brigandage
  continued to exist in connexion <!-- Page 565 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page565"></a>[v.04 p.0565]</span>with Christian revolt against the
  Turk, and the race conflicts of Albanians, Walachians, Pomuks, Bulgarians
  and Greeks. In Corsica the "maquis" has never been without its brigand
  hero, because industry has been stagnant, family feuds persist, and the
  government has never quite succeeded in persuading the people to support
  the law. The brigand is always a hero to at least one faction of
  Corsicans.</p>

  <p>The conditions which favour brigandage have been more prevalent, and
  for longer, in Italy than elsewhere in western Europe, with the standing
  exception of Corsica, which is Italian in all but political allegiance.
  Until the middle of the 19th century Italy was divided into small states,
  so that the brigand who was closely pursued in one could flee to another.
  Thus it was that Marco Sciarra of the Abruzzi, when hard pressed by the
  Spanish viceroy of Naples&mdash;just before and after 1600&mdash;could
  cross the border of the papal states and return on a favourable
  opportunity. When pope and viceroy combined against him he took service
  with Venice, from whence he could communicate with his friends at home,
  and pay them occasional visits. On one such visit he was led into a trap
  and slain. Marco Sciarra had terrorized the country far and wide at the
  head of 600 men. He was the follower and imitator of Benedetto Mangone,
  of whom it is recorded that, having stopped a party of travellers which
  included Torquato Tasso, he allowed them to pass unharmed out of his
  reverence for poets and poetry. Mangone was finally taken, and beaten to
  death with hammers at Naples. He and his like are the heroes of much
  popular verse, written in <i>ottava rima</i>, and beginning with the
  traditional epic invocation to the muse. A fine example is "The most
  beautiful history of the life and death of Pietro Mancino, chief of
  Banditti," which has remained popular with the people of southern Italy.
  It begins:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Io canto li ricatti, e il fiero ardire</p>
      <p>Del gran Pietro Mancino fuoruscito"</p>
      <p>(Pietro Mancino that great outlawed man</p>
      <p>I sing, and all his rage.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In Naples the number of competing codes and jurisdictions, the
  survival of the feudal power of the nobles, who sheltered banditti, just
  as a Highland chief gave refuge to "caterans" in Scotland, and the
  helplessness of the peasantry, made brigandage chronic, and the same
  conditions obtained in Sicily. The Bourbon dynasty reduced brigandage
  very much, and secured order on the main high-roads. But it was not
  extinguished, and it revived during the French invasion. This was the
  flourishing time of the notorious Fra Diavolo, who began as brigand and
  blossomed into a patriot. Fra Diavolo was captured and executed by the
  French. When Ferdinand was restored on the fall of Napoleon he employed
  an English officer, General Sir Richard Church, to suppress the brigands.
  General Church, who kept good order among his soldiers, and who made them
  pay for everything, gained the confidence of the peasantry, and restored
  a fair measure of security. It was he who finally brought to justice the
  villainous Don Ciro Anicchiarico&mdash;priest and brigand&mdash;who
  declared at his trial with offhand indifference that he supposed he had
  murdered about seventy people first and last. When a brother priest was
  sent to give him the consolations of religion, Ciro cut him short,
  saying, "Stop that chatter, we are two of a trade: we need not play the
  fool to one another" (<i>Lasciate queste chiacchiere, siamo dell' istessa
  professione: non ci burliamo fra noi</i>). Every successive revolutionary
  disturbance in Naples saw a recrudescence of brigandage down to the
  unification of 1860-1861, and then it was years before the Italian
  government rooted it out. The source of the trouble was the support the
  brigands received from various kinds of "<i>manuténgoli</i>"
  (maintainers)&mdash;great men, corrupt officials, political parties, and
  the peasants who were terrorized, or who profited by selling the brigands
  food and clothes. In Sicily brigandage has been endemic. In 1866 two
  English travellers, Mr E.J.C. Moens and the Rev. J.C. Murray Aynesley,
  were captured and held to ransom. Mr Moens found that the "manuténgoli"
  of the brigands among the peasants charged famine prices for food, and
  extortionate prices for clothes and cartridges. What is true of Naples
  and Sicily is true of other parts of Italy <i>mutatis mutandis</i>. In
  Tuscany, Piedmont and Lombardy the open country has been orderly, but the
  borders infested with brigands. The worst district outside Calabria has
  been the papal states. The Austrian general, Frimont, did, however,
  partly clear the Romagna about 1820, though at a heavy cost of life to
  his soldiers&mdash;mostly Bohemian Jägers&mdash;from the malaria.</p>

  <p>The history of brigandage in Spain is very similar. It may be said to
  have been endemic in and south of the Sierra Morena. In the north it has
  flourished when government was weak, and after foreign invasion and civil
  wars. But it has always been put down easily by a capable administration.
  It reached its greatest heights in Catalonia, where it began in the
  strife of the peasants against the feudal exactions of the landlords. It
  had its traditional hero, Roque Guinart, who figures in the second part
  of Don Quixote. The revolt against the house of Austria in 1640, and the
  War of the Succession (1700-1714), gave a great stimulus to Catalan
  brigandage. But it was then put down in a way for which Italy offers no
  precedent. A country gentleman named Pedro Veciana, hereditary
  <i>balio</i> (military and civil lieutenant) of the archbishop of
  Tarragona in the town of Valls, armed his farm-servants, and resisted the
  attacks of the brigands. With the help of neighbouring country gentlemen
  he formed a strong band, known as the Mozos (Boys) of Veciana. The
  brigands combined to get rid of him by making an attack on the town of
  Valls, but were repulsed with great loss. The government of Philip V.
  then commissioned Veciana to raise a special corps of police, the
  "escuadra de Cataluna," which still exists. For five generations the
  colonel of the escuadra was always a Veciana. At all times in central and
  northern Spain the country population has supported the police when the
  government would act firmly. Since the organization of the excellent
  constabulary called "La Guardia Civil" by the duke of Ahumada, about
  1844, brigandage has been well kept down. At the close of the Carlist War
  in 1874 a few bands infested Catalonia, but one of the worst was
  surprised, and all its members battered to death with boxwood cudgels by
  a gang of charcoal-burners on the ruins of the castle of San Martin de
  Centellas. In such conditions as these brigandage cannot last. More
  sympathy is felt for "bandoleros" in the south, and there also they find
  Spanish equivalents for the "manuténgoli" of Italy. The tobacco smuggling
  from Gibraltar keeps alive a lawless class which sinks easily into pure
  brigandage. Perhaps the influence of the Berber blood in the population
  helps to prolong this barbarism. The Sierra Morena, and the Serrania de
  Ronda, have produced the bandits whose achievements form the subject of
  popular ballads, such as Francisco Esteban El Guapo (Francis Stephen, the
  Buck or Dandy), Don Juan de Serralonga, Pedranza, &amp;c. The name of
  José Maria has been made familiar to all the world by Merimée's story,
  <i>Carmen</i>, and by Bizet's opera. José Maria, called El Tempranillo
  (the early bird), was a historical personage, a liberal in the rising
  against Ferdinand VII., 1820-1823, then a smuggler, then a "bandolero."
  He was finally bought off by the government, and took a commission to
  suppress the other brigands. Jose Maria was at last shot by one of them,
  whom he was endeavouring to arrest. The civil guard prevents brigandage
  from reaching any great height in normal times, but in 1905 a bandit of
  the old stamp, popularly known as "El Vivillo" (the Vital Spark), haunted
  the Serrania de Ronda.</p>

  <p>The brigand life has been made the subject of much romance. But when
  stripped of fiction it appears that the bands have been mostly recruited
  by men who had been guilty of homicide, out of jealousy or in a gambling
  quarrel, and who remained in them not from love of the life, but from
  fear of the gallows. A reformed brigand, known as Passo di Lupo (Wolf's
  Step), confessed to Mr McFarlane about 1820 that the weaker members of
  the band were terrorized and robbed by the bullies, and that murderous
  conflicts were constant among them.</p>

  <p>The "dacoits" or brigands of India were of the same stamp as their
  European colleagues. The Pindaris were more than brigands, and the Thugs
  were a religious sect.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The literature of
  brigandage, apart from pure romances, or official reports of trials, is
  naturally extensive. Mr <!-- Page 566 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  of Banditti and Robbers</i> (London, 1837) is a useful introduction to
  the subject. The author saw a part of what he wrote about, and gives many
  references, particularly for Italy. A good bibliography of Spanish
  brigandage will be found in the <i>Reseña Historica de la Guardia
  Civil</i> of Eugenio de la Iglesia (Madrid, 1898). For actual pictures of
  the life, nothing is better than the <i>English Travellers and Italian
  Brigands</i> of W.J.C. Moens (London, 1866), and <i>The Brigands of the
  Morea</i>, by S. Soteropoulos, translated by the Rev. J.O. Bagdon

  others, Ribble) on the west as far northwards as the Wall of Antoninus.
  Their territory thus included most of Yorkshire, the whole of Lancashire,
  Durham, Westmorland, Cumberland and part of Northumberland. Their chief
  town was Eburacum (or Eboracum; York). They first came into contact with
  the Romans during the reign of Claudius, when they were defeated by
  Publius Ostorius Scapula. Under Vespasian they submitted to Petillius
  Cerealis, but were not finally subdued till the time of Antoninus Pius
  (Tac. <i>Agricola</i>, 17; Pausan. viii. 43. 4). The name of their

  Journal</i>, xlix., 1892), and also that of a god Bergans = Brigans

  <p><b>BRIGGS, CHARLES AUGUSTUS</b> (1841- ), American Hebrew scholar and
  theologian, was born in New York City on the 15th of January 1841. He was
  educated at the university of Virginia (1857-1860), graduated at the
  Union Theological Seminary in 1863, and studied further at the university
  of Berlin. He was pastor of the Presbyterian church of Roselle, New
  Jersey, 1869-1874, and professor of Hebrew and cognate languages in Union
  Theological Seminary 1874-1891, and of Biblical theology there from 1891
  to 1904, when he became professor of theological encyclopaedia and
  symbolics. From 1880 to 1890 he was an editor of the <i>Presbyterian
  Review</i>. In 1892 he was tried for heresy by the presbytery of New York
  and acquitted. The charges were based upon his inaugural address of the
  preceding year. In brief they were as follows: that he had taught that
  reason and the Church are each a "fountain of divine authority which
  apart from Holy Scripture may and does savingly enlighten men"; that
  "errors may have existed in the original text of the Holy Scripture";
  that "many of the Old Testament predictions have been reversed by
  history" and that "the great body of Messianic prediction has not and
  cannot be fulfilled"; that "Moses is not the author of the Pentateuch,"
  and that "Isaiah is not the author of half of the book which bears his
  name"; that "the processes of redemption extend to the world to
  come"&mdash;he had considered it a fault of Protestant theology that it
  limits redemption to this world&mdash;and that "sanctification is not
  complete at death." The general assembly, to which the case was appealed,
  suspended Dr Briggs in 1893, being influenced, it would seem, in part, by
  the manner and tone of his expressions&mdash;by what his own colleagues
  in the Union Theological Seminary called the "dogmatic and irritating"
  nature of his inaugural address. He was ordained a priest of the
  Protestant Episcopal Church in 1899. His scholarship procured for him the
  honorary degree of D.D. from Edinburgh (1884) and from Glasgow (1901),
  and that of Litt.D. from Oxford (1901). With S.R. Driver and Francis
  Brown he prepared a revised <i>Hebrew and English Lexicon</i>
  (1891-1905), and with Driver edited the "International Commentary
  Series." His publications include <i>Biblical Study: Its Principles,
  Methods and History</i> (1883); <i>Hebrew Poems of the Creation</i>
  (1884); <i>American Presbyterianism: Its Origin and Early History</i>
  (1885); <i>Messianic Prophecy</i> (1886); <i>Whither? A Theological

  daughter; and <i>The Virgin Birth of Our Lord</i> (1909).</p>

  <p><b>BRIGGS, HENRY</b> (1556-1630), English mathematician, was born at
  Warley Wood, near Halifax, in Yorkshire. He graduated at St John's
  College, Cambridge, in 1581, and obtained a fellowship in 1588. In 1592
  he was made reader of the physical lecture founded by Dr Thomas Linacre,
  and in 1596 first professor of geometry in Gresham House (afterwards
  College), London. In his lectures at Gresham House he proposed the
  alteration of the scale of logarithms from the hyperbolic form which John
  Napier had given them, to that in which unity is assumed as the logarithm
  of the ratio of ten to one; and soon afterwards he wrote to the inventor
  on the subject. In 1616 he paid a visit to Napier at Edinburgh in order
  to discuss the suggested change; and next year he repeated his visit for
  a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by
  Briggs was agreed upon; and on his return from his second visit to
  Edinburgh in 1617 he accordingly published the first chiliad of his
  logarithms. (See <span class="sc">Napier, John</span>.) In 1619 he was
  appointed Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford, and resigned his
  professorship of Gresham College on the 25th of July 1620. Soon after his
  settlement at Oxford he was incorporated master of arts. In 1622 he
  published a small tract on the <i>North-West Passage to the South Seas,
  through the Continent of Virginia and Hudson's Bay</i>; and in 1624 his
  <i>Arithmetica Logarithmica</i>, in folio, a work containing the
  logarithms of thirty thousand natural numbers to fourteen places of
  figures besides the index. He also completed a table of logarithmic sines
  and tangents for the hundredth part of every degree to fourteen places of
  figures besides the index, with a table of natural sines to fifteen
  places, and the tangents and secants for the same to ten places; all of
  which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title
  of <i>Trigonometria Britannica</i> (see <span class="sc">Table,
  Mathematical</span>). Briggs died on the 26th of January 1630, and was
  buried in Merton College chapel, Oxford. Dr Smith, in his <i>Lives of the
  Gresham Professors</i>, characterizes him as a man of great probity, a
  contemner of riches, and contented with his own station, preferring a
  studious retirement to all the splendid circumstances of life.</p>

  <p><b>BRIGHT, SIR CHARLES TILSTON</b> (1832-1888), English telegraph
  engineer, who came of an old Yorkshire family, was born on the 8th of
  June 1832, at Wanstead, Essex. At the age of fifteen he became a clerk
  under the Electric Telegraph Company. His talent for electrical
  engineering was soon shown, and his progress was rapid; so that in 1852
  he was appointed engineer to the Magnetic Telegraph Company, and in that
  capacity superintended the laying of lines in various parts of the
  British Isles, including in 1853 the first cable between Great Britain
  and Ireland, from Portpatrick to Donaghadee. His experiments convinced
  him of the practicability of an electric submarine cable connexion
  between Ireland and America; and having in 1855 already discussed the
  question with Cyrus Field, who with J. W. Brett controlled the
  Newfoundland Telegraph Company on the other side of the ocean, Bright
  organized with them the Atlantic Telegraph Company in 1856 for the
  purpose of carrying out the idea, himself becoming engineer-in-chief. The
  story of the first Atlantic cable is told elsewhere (see <span
  class="sc">Telegraph</span>), and it must suffice here to say that in
  1858, after two disappointments, Bright successfully accomplished what to
  many had seemed an impossible feat, and within a few days of landing the
  Irish end of the line at Valentia he was knighted in Dublin. Subsequently
  Sir Charles Bright supervised the laying of submarine cables in various
  regions of the world, and took a leading part as pioneer in other
  developments of the electrical industry. In conjunction with Josiah
  Latimer Clark, with whom he entered into partnership in 1861, he invented
  improved methods of insulating submarine cables, and a paper on
  electrical standards read by them before the British Association in the
  same year led to the establishment of the British Association committee
  on that subject, whose work formed the foundations of the system still in
  use. From 1865 to 1868 he was Liberal M.P. for Greenwich. He died on the
  3rd of May 1888, at Abbey Wood, near London.</p>

  <p>See <i>Life Story of Sir C. T. Bright</i>, by his son Charles Bright
  (revised ed. 1908).</p>

  <p><b>BRIGHT, JOHN</b> (1811-1889), British statesman, was born at
  Rochdale on the 16th of November 1811. His father, Jacob Bright, was a
  much-respected Quaker, who had started a cottonmill at Rochdale in 1809.
  The family had reached Lancashire by two migrations. Abraham Bright was a
  Wiltshire yeoman, who, early in the 18th century, removed to Coventry,
  where his descendants remained, and where, in 1775, Jacob Bright was
  born. Jacob Bright was educated at the Ackworth school of the Society of
  Friends, and was apprenticed to a fustian manufacturer at New Mills. He
  married his employer's daughter, and settled with his two brothers-in-law
  at Rochdale in 1802, going into business for himself seven years later.
  His first wife died without children, and in 1809 he married Martha Wood,
  daughter of a tradesman of Bolton-le-Moors. She had been educated at
  Ackworth school, and was a woman of great strength of character and
  refined taste. There were eleven children of this marriage, of whom John
  Bright was the second, but the death of his elder brother in childhood
  made him the eldest son. He was a delicate child, and was sent as a
  day-scholar to a boarding-school near his home, kept by Mr William
  Littlewood. A year at the Ackworth school, two years at a school at York,
  and a year and a half at Newton, near Clitheroe, completed his education.
  He learned, he himself said, but little Latin and Greek, but acquired a
  great love of English literature, which his mother fostered, and a love
  of outdoor pursuits. In his sixteenth year he entered his father's mill,
  and in due time became a partner in the business. Two agitations were
  then going on in Rochdale&mdash;the first (in which Jacob Bright was a
  leader) in opposition to a local church-rate, and the second for
  parliamentary reform, by which Rochdale successfully claimed to have a
  member allotted to it under the Reform Bill. In both these movements John
  Bright took part. He was an ardent Nonconformist, proud to number among
  his ancestors John Gratton, a friend of George Fox, and one of the
  persecuted and imprisoned preachers of the Society of Friends. His
  political interest was probably first kindled by the Preston election in
  1830, in which Lord Stanley, after a long struggle, was defeated by
  "Orator" Hunt. But it was as a member of the Rochdale Juvenile Temperance
  Band that he first learned public speaking. These young men went out into
  the villages, borrowed a chair of a cottager, and spoke from it at
  open-air meetings. In Mrs John Mills's life of her husband is an account
  of John Bright's first extempore speech. It was at a temperance meeting.
  Bright got his notes muddled, and broke down. The chairman gave out a
  temperance song, and during the singing told Bright to put his notes
  aside and say what came into his mind. Bright obeyed, began with much
  hesitancy, but found his tongue and made an excellent address. On some
  early occasions, however, he committed his speech to memory. In 1832 he
  called on the Rev. John Aldis, an eminent Baptist minister, to accompany
  him to a local Bible meeting. Mr Aldis described him as a slender, modest
  young gentleman, who surprised him by his intelligence and
  thoughtfulness, but who seemed nervous as they walked to the meeting
  together. At the meeting he made a stimulating speech, and on the way
  home asked for advice. Mr Aldis counselled him not to learn his speeches,
  but to write out and commit to memory certain passages and the
  peroration. Bright took the advice, and acted on it all his life.</p>

  <p>This "first lesson in public speaking," as Bright called it, was given
  in his twenty-first year, but he had not then contemplated entering on a
  public career. He was a fairly prosperous man of business, very happy in
  his home, and always ready to take part in the social, educational and
  political life of his native town. He was one of the founders of the
  Rochdale Literary and Philosophical Society, took a leading part in its
  debates, and on returning from a holiday journey in the East, gave the
  society a lecture on his travels. He first met Richard Cobden in 1836 or
  1837. Cobden was an alderman of the newly formed Manchester corporation,
  and Bright went to ask him to speak at an education meeting in Rochdale.
  "I found him," said Bright, "in his office in Mosley Street, introduced
  myself to him, and told him what I wanted." Cobden consented, and at the
  meeting was much struck by Bright's short speech, and urged him to speak
  against the Corn Laws. His first speech on the Corn Laws was made at
  Rochdale in 1838, and in the same year he joined the Manchester
  provisional committee which in 1839 founded the Anti-Corn Law League He
  was still only the local public man, taking part in all public movements,
  especially in opposition to John Feilden's proposed factory legislation,
  and to the Rochdale church-rate. In 1839 he built the house which he
  called "One Ash," and married Elizabeth, daughter of Jonathan Priestman
  of Newcastle-on-Tyne. In November of the same year there was a dinner at
  Bolton to Abraham Paulton, who had just returned from a successful
  Anti-Corn Law tour in Scotland. Among the speakers were Cobden and
  Bright, and the dinner is memorable as the first occasion on which the
  two future leaders appeared together on a Free Trade platform. Bright is
  described by the historian of the League as "a young man then appearing
  for the first time in any meeting out of his own town, and giving
  evidence, by his energy and by his grasp of the subject, of his capacity
  soon to take a leading part in the great agitation." But his call had not
  yet come. In 1840 he led a movement against the Rochdale church-rate,
  speaking from a tombstone in the churchyard, where it looks down on the
  town in the valley below. A very happy married life at home contented
  him, and at the opening of the Free Trade hall in January 1840 he sat
  with the Rochdale deputation, undistinguished in the body of the meeting.
  A daughter, Helen, was born to him; but his young wife, after a long
  illness, died of consumption in September 1841. Three days after her
  death at Leamington, Cobden called to see him. "I was in the depths of
  grief," said Bright, when unveiling <!-- Page 568 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page568"></a>[v.04 p.0568]</span>the statue of
  his friend at Bradford in 1877, "I might almost say of despair, for the
  life and sunshine of my house had been extinguished." Cobden spoke some
  words of condolence, but after a time he looked up and said, 'There are
  thousands of homes in England at this moment where wives, mothers and
  children are dying of hunger. Now, when the first paroxysm of your grief
  is past, I would advise you to come with me, and we will never rest till
  the Corn Laws are repealed.' "I accepted his invitation," added Bright,
  "and from that time we never ceased to labour hard on behalf of the
  resolution which we had made." At the general election in 1841 Cobden was
  returned for Stockport, and in 1843 Bright was the Free Trade candidate
  at a by-election at Durham. He was defeated, but his successful
  competitor was unseated on petition, and at the second contest Bright was
  returned. He was already known in the country as Cobden's chief ally, and
  was received in the House of Commons with a suspicion and hostility even
  greater than had met Cobden himself. In the Anti-Corn Law movement the
  two speakers were the complements and correlatives of each other. Cobden
  had the calmness and confidence of the political philosopher, Bright had
  the passion and the fervour of the popular orator. Cobden did the
  reasoning, Bright supplied the declamation, but like Demosthenes he
  mingled argument with appeal. No orator of modern times rose more rapidly
  to a foremost place. He was not known beyond his own borough when Cobden
  called him to his side in 1841, and he entered parliament towards the end
  of the session of 1843 with a formidable reputation as an agitator. He
  had been all over England and Scotland addressing vast meetings and, as a
  rule, carrying them with him; he had taken a leading part in a conference
  held by the Anti-Corn Law League in London, had led deputations to the
  duke of Sussex, to Sir James Graham, then home secretary, and to Lord
  Ripon and Mr Gladstone, the secretary and under secretary of the Board of
  Trade; and he was universally recognized as the chief orator of the Free
  Trade movement. Wherever "John Bright of Rochdale" was announced to
  speak, vast crowds assembled. He had been so announced, for the last
  time, at the first great meeting in Drury Lane theatre on 15th March
  1843; henceforth his name was enough. He took his seat in the House of
  Commons as one of the members for Durham on 28th July 1843, and on 7th
  August delivered his maiden speech in support of a motion by Mr Ewart for
  reduction of import duties. He was there, he said, "not only as one of
  the representatives of the city of Durham, but also as one of the
  representatives of that benevolent organization, the Anti-Corn Law
  League." A member who heard the speech described Bright as "about the
  middle size, rather firmly and squarely built, with a fair, clear
  complexion, and an intelligent and pleasing expression of countenance.
  His voice is good, his enunciation distinct, and his delivery free from
  any unpleasant peculiarity or mannerism." He wore the usual Friend's
  coat, and was regarded with much interest and hostile curiosity on both
  sides of the House.</p>

  <p>Mr Ewart's motion was defeated, but the movement of which Cobden and
  Bright were the leaders continued to spread. In the autumn the League
  resolved to raise £100,000; an appeal was made to the agricultural
  interest by great meetings in the farming counties, and in November
  <i>The Times</i> startled the world by declaring, in a leading article,
  "The League is a great fact. It would be foolish, nay, rash, to deny its
  importance." In London great meetings were held in Covent Garden theatre,
  at which William Johnson Fox was the chief orator, but Bright and Cobden
  were the leaders of the movement. Bright publicly deprecated the popular
  tendency to regard Cobden and himself as the chief movers in the
  agitation, and Cobden told a Rochdale audience that he always stipulated
  that he should speak first, and Bright should follow. His "more stately
  genius," as Mr John Morley calls it, was already making him the
  undisputed master of the feelings of his audiences. In the House of
  Commons his progress was slower. Cobden's argumentative speeches were
  regarded more sympathetically than Bright's more rhetorical appeals, and
  in a debate on Villiers's annual motion against the Corn Laws Bright was
  heard with so much impatience that he was obliged to sit down. In the
  next session (1845) he moved for an inquiry into the operation of the
  Game Laws. At a meeting of county members earlier in the day Peel had
  advised them not to be led into discussion by a violent speech from the
  member for Durham, but to let the committee be granted without debate.
  Bright was not violent, and Cobden said that he did his work admirably,
  and won golden opinions from all men. The speech established his position
  in the House of Commons. In this session Bright and Cobden came into
  opposition, Cobden voting for the Maynooth Grant and Bright against it.
  On only one other occasion&mdash;a vote for South Kensington&mdash;did
  they go into opposite lobbies, during twenty-five years of parliamentary
  life. In the autumn of 1845 Bright retained Cobden in the public career
  to which Cobden had invited him four years before. Bright was in Scotland
  when a letter came from Cobden announcing his determination, forced on
  him by business difficulties, to retire from public work. Bright replied
  that if Cobden retired the mainspring of the League was gone. "I can in
  no degree take your place," he wrote. "As a second I can fight, but there
  are incapacities about me, of which I am fully conscious, which prevent
  my being more than second in such a work as we have laboured in." A few
  days later he set off for Manchester, posting in that wettest of autumns
  through "the rain that rained away the Corn Laws," and on his arrival got
  his friends together, and raised the money which tided Cobden over the
  emergency. The crisis of the struggle had come. Peel's budget in 1845 was
  a first step towards Free Trade. The bad harvest and the potato disease
  drove him to the repeal of the Corn Laws, and at a meeting in Manchester
  on 2nd July 1846 Cobden moved and Bright seconded a motion dissolving the
  league. A library of twelve hundred volumes was presented to Bright as a
  memorial of the struggle.</p>

  <p>Bright married, in June 1847, Miss Margaret Elizabeth Leatham, of
  Wakefield, by whom he had seven children, Mr John Albert Bright being the
  eldest. In the succeeding July he was elected for Manchester, with Mr
  Milner Gibson, without a contest. In the new parliament, as in the
  previous session, he opposed legislation restricting the hours of labour,
  and, as a Nonconformist, spoke against clerical control of national
  education. In 1848 he voted for Hume's household suffrage motion, and
  introduced a bill for the repeal of the Game Laws. When Lord John Russell
  brought forward his Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, Bright opposed it as "a
  little, paltry, miserable measure," and foretold its failure. In this
  parliament he spoke much on Irish questions. In a speech in favour of the
  government bill for a rate in aid in 1849, he won loud cheers from both
  sides, and was complimented by Disraeli for having sustained the
  reputation of that assembly. From this time forward he had the ear of the
  House, and took effective part in the debates. He spoke against capital
  punishment, against church-rates, against flogging in the army, and
  against the Irish Established Church. He supported Cobden's motion for
  the reduction of public expenditure, and in and out of parliament pleaded
  for peace. In the election of 1852 he was again returned for Manchester
  on the principles of free trade, electoral reform and religious freedom.
  But war was in the air, and the most impassioned speeches he ever
  delivered were addressed to this parliament in fruitless opposition to
  the Crimean War. Neither the House nor the country would listen. "I went
  to the House on Monday," wrote Macaulay in March 1854, "and heard Bright
  say everything I thought." His most memorable speech, the greatest he
  ever made, was delivered on the 23rd of February 1855. "The angel of
  death has been abroad throughout the land. You may almost hear the
  beating of his wings," he said, and concluded with an appeal to the prime
  minister that moved the House as it had never been moved within living
  memory. There was a tremor in Bright's voice in the touching parts of his
  great speeches which stirred the feelings even of hostile listeners. It
  was noted for the first time in this February speech, but the most
  striking instance was in a speech on Mr Osborne Morgan's Burials Bill in
  April 1875, in which he described a Quaker funeral, and protested against
  the "miserable superstition of the phrase 'buried like a dog.'" "In that
  sense," he said, <!-- Page 569 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page569"></a>[v.04 p.0569]</span>"I shall be buried like a dog, and
  all those with whom I am best acquainted, whom I best love and esteem,
  will be 'buried like a dog.' Nay more, my own ancestors, who in past time
  suffered persecution for what is now held to be a righteous cause, have
  all been buried like dogs, if that phrase is true." The tender,
  half-broken tones in which these words were said, the inexpressible
  pathos of his voice and manner, were never forgotten by those who heard
  that Wednesday morning speech.</p>

  <p>Bright was disqualified by illness during the whole of 1856 and 1857.
  In Palmerston's penal dissolution in the latter year, Bright was rejected
  by Manchester, but in August, while ill and absent, Birmingham elected
  him without a contest. He returned to parliament in 1858, and in February
  seconded the motion which threw out Lord Palmerston's government. Lord
  Derby thereupon came into office for the second time, and Bright had the
  satisfaction of assisting in the passing of two measures which he had
  long advocated&mdash;the admission of Jews to parliament and the transfer
  of the government of India from the East India Company to the crown. He
  was now restored to full political activity, and in October addressed his
  new constituents, and started a movement for parliamentary reform. He
  spoke at great gatherings at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bradford and Manchester,
  and his speeches filled the papers. For the next nine years he was the
  protagonist of Reform. Towards the close of the struggle he told the
  House of Commons that a thousand meetings had been held, that at every
  one the doors were open for any man to enter, yet that an almost
  unanimous vote for reform had been taken. In the debates on the Reform
  Bills submitted to the House of Commons from 1859. to 1867, Bright's was
  the most influential voice. He rebuked Lowe's "Botany Bay view," and
  described Horsman as retiring to his "cave of Adullam," and hooking in
  Lowe. "The party of two," he said, "reminds me of the Scotch terrier,
  which was so covered with hair that you could not tell which was the head
  and which was the tail." These and similar phrases, such as the excuse
  for withdrawing the Reform Bill in the year of the great budget of
  1860&mdash;"you cannot get twenty wagons at once through Temple
  Bar"&mdash;were in all men's mouths. It was one of the triumphs of
  Bright's oratory that it constantly produced these popular cries. The
  phrase "a free breakfast table" was his; and on the rejection of
  Forster's Compensation for Disturbance Bill he used the phrase as to
  Irish discontent, "Force is not a remedy."</p>

  <p>During his great reform agitation Bright had vigorously supported
  Cobden in the negotiations for the treaty of commerce with France, and
  had taken, with his usual vehemence, the side of the North in the
  discussions in England on the American Civil War. In March 1865 Cobden
  died, and Bright told the House of Commons he dared not even attempt to
  express the feelings which oppressed him, and sat down overwhelmed with
  grief. Their friendship was one of the most characteristic features of
  the public life of their time. "After twenty years of intimate and almost
  brotherly friendship with him," said Bright, "I little knew how much I
  loved him till I had lost him." In June 1865 parliament was dissolved,
  and Bright was returned for Birmingham without opposition. Palmerston's
  death in the early autumn brought Lord John Russell into power, and for
  the first time Bright gave his support to the government. Russell's
  fourth Reform Bill was introduced, was defeated by the Adullamites, and
  the Derby-Disraeli ministry was installed. Bright declared Lord Derby's
  accession to be a declaration of war against the working classes, and
  roused the great towns in the demand for reform. Bright was the popular
  hero of the time. As a political leader the winter of 1866-1867 was the
  culminating point in his career. The Reform Bill was carried with a
  clause for minority representation, and in the autumn of 1868 Bright,
  with two Liberal colleagues, was again returned for Birmingham. Mr
  Gladstone came into power with a programme of Irish reform in church and
  land such as Bright had long urged, and he accepted the post of president
  of the Board of Trade. He thus became a member of the privy council, with
  the title of Right Honourable, and from this time forth was a recognized
  leader of the Liberal party in parliament and in the country. He made a
  great speech on the second reading of the Irish Church Bill, and wrote a
  letter on the House of Lords, in which he said, "In harmony with the
  nation they may go on for a long time, but throwing themselves athwart
  its course they may meet with accidents not pleasant for them to think
  of." He also spoke strongly in the same session in favour of the bill
  permitting marriage with a deceased wife's sister. The next session found
  him disqualified by a severe illness, which caused his retirement from
  office at the end of the year, and kept him out of public life for four
  years. In August 1873 Mr Gladstone reconstructed his cabinet, and Bright
  returned to it as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. But his hair had
  become white, and though he spoke again with much of his former vigour,
  he was now an old man. In the election in January 1874 Bright and his
  colleagues were returned for Birmingham without opposition. When Mr
  Gladstone resigned the leadership of his party in 1875, Bright was
  chairman of the party meeting which chose Lord Hartington as his
  successor. He took a less prominent part in political discussion till the
  Eastern Question brought Great Britain to the verge of war with Russia,
  and his old energy flamed up afresh. In the debate on the vote of credit
  in February 1878, he made one of his impressive speeches, urging the
  government not to increase the difficulties manufacturers had in finding
  employment for their workpeople by any single word or act which could
  shake confidence in business. The debate lasted five days. On the fifth
  day a telegram from Mr Layard was published announcing that the Russians
  were nearing Constantinople. The day, said <i>The Times</i>, "was crowded
  with rumours, alarms, contradictions, fears, hopes, resolves,
  uncertainties." In both Houses Mr Layard's despatch was read, and in the
  excited Commons Mr Forster's resolution opposing the vote of credit was
  withdrawn. Bright, however, distrusted the ambassador at the Porte, and
  gave reasons for doubting the alarming telegram. While he was speaking a
  note was put into the hands of Sir Stafford Northcote, and when Bright
  sat down he read it to the House. It was a confirmation from the Russian
  prime minister of Bright's doubts: "There is not a word of truth in the
  rumours which have reached you." At the general election in 1880 he was
  re-elected at Birmingham, and joined Mr Gladstone's new government as
  chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. For two sessions he spoke and voted
  with his colleagues, but after the bombardment of the Alexandria forts he
  left the ministry and never held office again. He felt most painfully the
  severance from his old and trusted leader, but it was forced on him by
  his conviction of the danger and impolicy of foreign entanglements. He,
  however, gave a general support to Mr Gladstone's government. In 1883 he
  took the chair at a meeting of the Liberation Society in Mr Spurgeon's
  chapel; and in June of that year was the object of an unparalleled
  demonstration at Birmingham to celebrate his twenty-five years of service
  as its representative. At this celebration he spoke strongly of "the
  Irish rebel party," and accused the Conservatives of "alliance" with
  them, but withdrew the imputation when Sir Stafford Northcote moved that
  such language was a breach of the privileges of the House of Commons. At
  a banquet to Lord Spencer he accused the Irish members of having
  "exhibited a boundless sympathy for criminals and murderers." He refused
  in the House of Commons to apologise for these words, and was supported
  in his refusal by both sides of the House. At the Birmingham election in
  1885 he stood for the central division of the redistributed constituency;
  he was opposed by Lord Randolph Churchill, but was elected by a large
  majority. In the new parliament he voted against the Home Rule Bill, and
  it was generally felt that in the election of 1886 which followed its
  defeat, when he was re-elected without opposition, his letters told with
  fatal effect against the Home Rule Liberals. His contribution to the
  discussion was a suggestion that the Irish members should form a grand
  committee to which every Irish bill should go after first reading. The
  break-up of the Liberal party filled him with gloom. His last speech at
  Birmingham was on 29th March 1888, at a banquet to celebrate Mr
  Chamberlain's return from his peace mission to the United States. He
  spoke of imperial federation as a "dream and an absurdity." In May his
  illness returned, he took to his bed in <!-- Page 570 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page570"></a>[v.04 p.0570]</span>October, and
  died on the 27th of March 1889. He was buried in the graveyard of the
  meeting-house of the Society of Friends in Rochdale.</p>

  <p>Bright had much literary and social recognition in his later years. In
  1882 he was elected lord rector of the university of Glasgow, and Dr Dale
  wrote of his rectorial address: "It was not the old Bright." "I am weary
  of public speaking," he had told Dr Dale; "my mind is almost a blank." He
  was given an honorary degree of the university of Oxford in 1886, and in
  1888 a statue of him was erected at Birmingham. The 3rd marquess of
  Salisbury said of him, and it sums up his character as a public man: "He
  was the greatest master of English oratory that this generation&mdash;I
  may say several generations&mdash;has seen.... At a time when much
  speaking has depressed, has almost exterminated eloquence, he maintained
  that robust, powerful and vigorous style in which he gave fitting
  expression to the burning and noble thoughts he desired to utter."</p>

  <p><b>BRIGHTLINGSEA</b> (pronounced <span class="sc">Brittlesea</span>),
  a port and fishing station in the Harwich parliamentary division of
  Essex, England, on a creek opening from the east shore of the Colne
  estuary, the terminus of a branch from Colchester of the Great Eastern
  railway, 62½ m. E.N.E. of London. Pop. of urban district (1901) 4501. The
  Colchester oyster beds are mainly in this part of the Colne, and the
  oyster fishery is the chief industry. Boat-building is carried on. This
  is also a favourite yachting centre. The church of All Saints,
  principally Perpendicular, has interesting monuments and brasses, and a
  fine lofty tower and west front. Brightlingsea, which appears in
  Domesday, is a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich in Kent. Near the
  opposite shore of the creek is St Osyth's priory, which originated as a
  nunnery founded by Osyth, a grand-daughter of Penda, king of Mercia,
  martyred (<i>c.</i> 653) by Norse invaders. A foundation for Augustinian
  canons followed on the site early in the 12th century. The remains,
  incorporated with a modern residence, include a late Perpendicular
  gateway, abbots' tower, clock tower and crypt. The gateway, an embattled
  structure with flanking turrets, is particularly fine, the entire front
  being panelled and ornamented with canopied niches. The church of St
  Osyth, also Perpendicular in the main, is of interest.</p>

  <p><b>BRIGHTON,</b> a watering-place of Bourke county, Victoria,
  Australia, 7½ m. by rail S.E. of Melbourne, of which it is practically a
  suburb. It stands on the east shore of Port Phillip, and has two piers, a
  great extent of sandy beach and numerous beautiful villas. Pop. (1901)
  10,029.</p>

  <p><b>BRIGHTON,</b> a municipal, county and parliamentary borough of
  Sussex, England, one of the best-known seaside resorts in the United
  Kingdom, 51 m. S. from London by the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast
  railway. Pop. (1901) 123,478. Its ready accessibility from the metropolis
  is the chief factor in its popularity. It is situated on the seaward
  slope of the South Downs; the position is sheltered from inclement winds,
  and the climate is generally mild. The sea-front, overlooking the English
  Channel, stretches nearly 4 m. from Kemp Town on the east to Hove (a
  separate municipal borough) on the west. Inland, including the suburb of
  Preston, the town extends some 2 m. The tendency of the currents in the
  Channel opposite Brighton is to drive the shingle eastward, and
  encroachments of the sea were frequent and serious until the erection of
  a massive sea-wall, begun about 1830, 60 ft. high, 23 ft. thick at the
  base, and 3 ft. at the summit. There are numerous modern churches and
  chapels, many of them very handsome; and the former parish church of St
  Nicholas remains, a Decorated structure containing a Norman font and a
  memorial to the great duke of Wellington. The incumbency of Trinity
  Chapel was held by the famous preacher Frederick William Robertson
  (1847-1853). The town hall and the parochial offices are the principal
  administrative buildings. Numerous institutions contribute to the
  entertainment of visitors. Of these the most remarkable is the Pavilion,
  built as a residence for the prince regent (afterwards George IV.) and
  remodelled in 1819 by the architect, John Nash, in a grotesque Eastern
  style of architecture. In 1849 it was purchased by the town for £53,000,
  and is devoted to various public uses, containing a museum,
  assembly-rooms and picture-galleries. The detached building, formerly the
  stables, is converted into a fine concert hall; it is lighted by a vast
  glazed dome approaching that of St Paul's cathedral, London, in
  dimensions. There are several theatres and music-halls. The aquarium, the
  property of the corporation, contains an excellent marine collection, but
  is also used as a concert hall and winter garden, and a garden is laid
  out on its roof. The Booth collection of British birds, bequeathed to the
  corporation by E.T. Booth, was opened in 1893. There are two piers, of
  which the Palace pier, near the site of the old chain pier (1823), which
  was washed away in 1896, is near the centre of the town, while the West
  pier is towards Hove. Preston and Queen's parks are the principal of
  several public recreation grounds; and the racecourse at Kemp Town is
  also the property of the town. Educational establishments are numerous,
  and include Brighton College, which ranks high among English public
  schools. There are municipal schools of science, technology and art. St
  Mary's Hall (1836) is devoted to the education of poor clergymen's
  daughters. Among many hospitals, the county hospital (1828), "open to the
  sick and lame poor of every country and nation," may be mentioned. There
  are an extensive mackerel and herring fishery, and motor engineering
  works. The parliamentary borough, which includes the parish of Hove,
  returns two members. The county borough was created in 1888. The
  municipal borough is under a mayor, 14 aldermen and 42 councillors. Area,
  2536 acres.</p>

  <p>Although there is evidence of Roman and Saxon occupation of the site,
  the earliest mention of Brighton (Bristelmeston, Brichelmestone,
  Brighthelmston) is the Domesday Book record that its three manors
  belonged to Earl Godwin and were held by William de Warenne. Of these,
  two passed to the priories of Lewes and Michelham respectively, and after
  the dissolution of the monasteries were subject to frequent sale and
  division. The third descended to the earls of Arundel, falling to the
  share of the duke of Norfolk in 1415, and being divided in 1502 between
  the families of Howard and Berkeley. That Brighton was a large fishing
  village in 1086 is evident from the rent of 4000 herrings; in 1285 it had
  a separate constable, and in 1333 it was assessed for a tenth, and
  fifteenth at £5:4:6¾, half the assessment of Shoreham. In 1340 there were
  no merchants there, only tenants of lands, but its prosperity increased
  during the 15th and 16th centuries, and it was assessed at £6:12:8 in
  1534. There is, however, no indication that it was a borough. In 1580
  commissioners sent to decide disputes between the fishermen and landsmen
  found that from time immemorial Brighton had been governed by two head
  boroughs sitting in the borough court, and assisted by a council called
  the Twelve. This constitution disappeared before 1772, when commissioners
  were appointed. Brighton refused a charter offered by George, prince of
  Wales, but was incorporated in 1854. It had become a parliamentary
  borough in 1832. From a fishing town in 1656 it became a fashionable
  resort in 1756; its popularity increased after the visit of the prince of
  Wales (see <span class="sc">George</span> IV.) to the duke of Cumberland
  in 1783, and was ensured by his building the Pavilion in 1784-1787, and
  his adoption of it as his principal residence; and his association with
  Mrs Fitzherbert at Brighton was the starting-point of its fashionable
  repute.</p>

  <p><b>BRIGHT'S DISEASE,</b> a term in medicine applied to a class of
  diseases of the kidneys (acute and chronic nephritis) which have as their
  most prominent symptom the presence of albumen in the urine, and
  frequently also the coexistence of dropsy. <!-- Page 571 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page571"></a>[v.04 p.0571]</span>These
  associated symptoms in connexion with kidney disease were first described
  in 1827 by Dr Richard Bright (1789-1858). Since that period it has been
  established that the symptoms, instead of being, as was formerly
  supposed, the result of one form of disease of the kidneys, may be
  dependent on various morbid conditions of those organs (see <span
  class="sc">Kidney Diseases</span>). Hence the term Bright's disease,
  which is retained in medical nomenclature in honour of Dr Bright, must be
  understood as having a generic application.</p>

  <p>The symptoms are usually of a severe character. Pain in the back,
  vomiting and febrile disturbance commonly usher in the attack. Dropsy,
  varying in degree from slight puffiness of the face to an accumulation of
  fluid sufficient to distend the whole body, and to occasion serious
  embarrassment to respiration, is a very common accompaniment. The urine
  is reduced in quantity, is of dark, smoky or bloody colour, and exhibits
  to chemical reaction the presence of a large amount of albumen, while,
  under the microscope, blood corpuscles and casts, as above mentioned, are
  found in abundance.</p>

  <p>This state of acute inflammation may by its severity destroy life, or,
  short of this, may by continuance result in the establishment of one of
  the chronic forms of Bright's disease. On the other hand an arrest of the
  inflammatory action frequently occurs, and this is marked by the
  increased amount of the urine, and the gradual disappearance of its
  albumen and other abnormal constituents; as also by the subsidence of the
  dropsy and the rapid recovery of strength.</p>

  <p>In the treatment of acute Bright's disease, good results are often
  obtained from local depletion, from warm baths and from the careful
  employment of diuretics and purgatives. Chronic Bright's disease is much
  less amenable to treatment, but by efforts to maintain the strength and
  improve the quality of the blood by strong nourishment, and at the same
  time by guarding against the risks of complications, life may often be
  prolonged in comparative comfort, and even a certain measure of
  improvement be experienced.</p>

  <p><b>BRIGNOLES,</b> a town in the department of Var in the S.E. of
  France, 36 m. by rail N. of Toulon. Pop. (1906) 3639. It is built at a
  height of 754 ft. above the sea-level, in a fertile valley, and on the
  right bank of the Carami river. It contains the old summer palace of the
  counts of Provence, and has an active trade, especially in prunes, known
  as <i>prunes de Brignoles</i>. Its old name was <i>Villa Puerorum</i>, as
  the children of the counts of Provence were often brought up here. It was
  sacked on several occasions during the religious wars in the 16th
  century. Twelve miles to the N.W. is St Maximin (with a fine medieval
  church), which is one of the best starting-points for the most famous
  pilgrimage resort in Provence, the Sainte Baume, wherein St Mary
  Magdalene is said to have taken refuge. This is 20 m. distant by
  road.</p>

  <p><b>BRIHASPATI,</b> or <span class="sc">Brahmanaspati</span> ("god of
  strength"), a deity of importance in early Hindu mythology. In the
  Rigveda he is represented as the god of prayer, aiding Indra in his
  conquest of the cloud-demon, and at times appears to be identified with
  Agni, god of fire. He is the offspring of Heaven and Earth, the two
  worlds; is the inspirer of prayer and the guide and protector of the
  pious. He is pictured as having seven mouths, a hundred wings and horns
  and is armed with bow and arrows and an axe. He rides in a chariot drawn
  by red horses. In the later scriptures he is represented as a Rishi or
  seer.</p>

  <p><b>BRIL, PAUL</b> (1554-1626), Flemish painter, was born at Antwerp.
  The success of his elder brother Matthew (1550-1584) in the Vatican
  induced him to go to Rome to live. On the death of Matthew, Paul, who far
  surpassed him as an artist, succeeded to his pensions and employments. He
  painted landscapes with a depth of chiaroscuro then little practised in
  Italy, and introduced into them figures well drawn and finely coloured.
  One of his best compositions is the "Martyrdom of St Clement," in the
  Sala Clementina of the Vatican.</p>

  <p><b>BRILL,</b> the name given to a flat-fish (<i>Psetta laevis</i>, or
  <i>Rhombus laevis</i>) which is a species closely related to the turbot,
  differing from it in having very small scales, being smaller in size,
  having no bony tubercules in the skin, and being reddish in colour. It
  abounds on parts of the British coast, and is only less favoured for the
  table than the turbot itself.</p>

  <p><b>BRILLAT-SAVARIN, ANTHELME</b> (1755-1826), French gastronomist, was
  born at Belley, France, on the 1st of April 1755. In 1789 he was a
  deputy, in 1793 mayor of Belley. To escape proscription he fled from
  France to Switzerland, and went thence to the United States, where he
  played in the orchestra of a New York theatre. On the fall of Robespierre
  he returned to France, and in 1797 became a member of the court of
  cassation. He wrote various volumes on political economy and law, but his
  name is famous for his <i>Physiologie du goût</i>, a compendium of the
  art of dining. Many editions of this work have been published.
  Brillat-Savarin died in Paris on the 2nd of February 1826.</p>

  <p><b>BRIMSTONE,</b> the popular name of sulphur (<i>q.v.</i>),
  particularly of the commercial "roll sulphur." The word means literally
  "burning stone"; the first part being formed from the stem of the Mid.

  <i>brenstone</i>, <i>bernstone</i>, <i>brynstone,</i> &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>BRIN, BENEDETTO</b> (1833-1898), Italian naval administrator, was
  born at Turin on the 17th of May 1833, and until the age of forty worked
  with distinction as a naval engineer. In 1873 Admiral Saint-Bon, minister
  of marine, appointed him under-secretary of state. The two men completed
  each other; Saint-Bon conceived a type of ship, Brin made the plans and
  directed its construction. On the advent of the Left to power in 1876,
  Brin was appointed minister of marine by Depretis, a capacity in which he
  continued the programme of Saint-Bon, while enlarging and completing it
  in such way as to form the first organic scheme for the development of
  the Italian fleet. The huge warships "Italia" and "Dandolo" were his
  work, though he afterwards abandoned their type in favour of smaller and
  faster vessels of the "Varese" and the "Garibaldi" class. By his
  initiative Italian naval industry, almost non-existent in 1873, made
  rapid progress. During his eleven years' ministry (1876-1878 with
  Depretis, 1884-1891 with Depretis and Crispi, 1896-1898 with Rudini), he
  succeeded in creating large private shipyards, engine works and
  metallurgical works for the production of armour, steel plates and guns.
  In 1892 he entered the Giolitti cabinet as minister for foreign affairs,
  accompanying, in that capacity, the king and queen of Italy to Potsdam,
  but showed weakness towards France on the occasion of the massacre of
  Italian workmen at Aigues-Mortes. He died on the 24th of May 1898, while
  minister of marine in the Rudini cabinet. He, more than any other man,
  must be regarded as the practical creator of the Italian navy.</p>

  <p><b>BRINDABAN,</b> a town of British India, in the Muttra district of
  the United Provinces, on the right bank of the Jumna, 6 m. N. of Muttra.
  Pop. (1901) 22,717. Brindaban is one of the most popular places of
  pilgrimage in India, being associated with the cult of Krishna as a
  shepherd. It contains bathing-stairs, tanks and wells, and a great number
  of handsome temples, of which the finest is that of Govind Deva, a
  cruciform vaulted building of red sandstone, dating from 1590. The town
  was founded earlier in the same century.</p>

  <p><b>BRINDISI</b> (anc. <i>Brundisium</i>, <i>q.v.</i>), a seaport town
  and archiepiscopal see of Apulia, Italy, in the province of Lecce, 24 m.
  N.W. by rail from the town of Lecce, and 346 m. from Ancona. Pop.(1861)
  8000; (1871) 13,755; (1901) 25,317. The chief importance of Brindisi is
  due to its position as a starting-point for the East. The inner harbour,
  admirably sheltered and 27 to 30 ft. in depth, allows ocean steamers to
  lie at the quays. Brindisi has, however, been abandoned by the large
  steamers of the Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which
  had called there since 1870, but since 1898 call at Marseilles instead;
  small express boats, carrying the mails, still leave every week,
  connecting with the larger steamers at Port Said; but the number of
  passengers leaving the port, which for the years 1893-1897 averaged
  14,728, was only 7608 in 1905, and only 943 of these were carried by the
  P. &amp; O. boats. The harbour railway station was not completed until
  1905 (<i>Consular <!-- Page 572 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page572"></a>[v.04 p.0572]</span>Report</i>, No. 3672, 1906, pp. 13
  sqq.). The port was cleared in 1905 by 1492 vessels of 1,486,269 tons.
  The imports represented a value of £629,892 and the exports a value of
  £663,201&mdash;an increase of £84,077 and £57,807 respectively on the
  figures of the previous year, while in 1899 the amounts, which were below
  the average, were only £298,400 and £253,000. The main imports are coal,
  flour, sulphur, timber and metals; and the main exports, wine and
  spirits, oil and dried fruits.</p>

  <p>Frederick II. erected a castle, with huge round towers, to guard the
  inner harbour; it is now a convict prison. The cathedral, ruined by
  earthquakes, was restored in 1743-1749, but has some remains of its
  mosaic pavement (1178). The baptismal church of S. Giovanni al Sepolcro
  (11th century) is now a museum. The town was captured in 836 by the
  Saracens, and destroyed by them; but was rebuilt in the 11th century by
  Lupus the protospatharius, Byzantine governor. In 1071 it fell into the
  hands of the Normans, and frequently appears in the history of the
  Crusades. Early in the 14th century the inner port was blocked by
  Giovanni Orsini, prince of Taranto; the town was devastated by pestilence
  in 1348, and was plundered in 1352 and 1383; but even greater damage was
  done by the earthquake of 1456.</p>

  <p><b>BRINDLEY, JAMES</b> (1716-1772), English engineer, was born at
  Thornsett, Derbyshire, in 1716. His parents were in very humble
  circumstances, and he received little or no education. At the age of
  seventeen he was apprenticed to a millwright near Macclesfield, and soon
  after completing his apprenticeship he set up in business for himself as
  a wheelwright at Leek, quickly becoming known for his ingenuity and skill
  in repairing all kinds of machinery. In 1752 he designed and set up an
  engine for draining some coal-pits at Clifton in Lancashire. Three years
  later he extended his reputation by completing the machinery for a
  silk-mill at Congleton. In 1759, when the duke of Bridgewater was anxious
  to improve the outlets for the coal on his estates, Brindley advised the
  construction of a canal from Worsley to Manchester. The difficulties in
  the way were great, but all were surmounted by his genius, and his
  crowning triumph was the construction of an aqueduct to carry the canal
  at an elevation of 39 ft. over the river Irwell at Barton. The great
  success of this canal encouraged similar projects, and Brindley was soon
  engaged in extending his first work to the Mersey, at Runcorn. He then
  designed and nearly completed what he called the Grand Trunk Canal,
  connecting the Trent and Humber with the Mersey. The Staffordshire and
  Worcestershire, the Oxford and the Chesterfield Canals were also planned
  by him, and altogether he laid out over 360 m. of canals. He died at
  Turnhurst, Staffordshire, on the 30th of September 1772. Brindley
  retained to the last a peculiar roughness of character and demeanour; but
  his innate power of thought more than compensated for his lack of
  training. It is told of him that when in any difficulty he used to retire
  to bed, and there remain thinking out his problem until the solution
  became clear to him. His mechanical ingenuity and fertility of resource
  were very remarkable, and he undoubtedly possessed the engineering
  faculty in a very high degree. He was an enthusiastic believer in canals,
  and his reported answer, when asked the use of navigable rivers, "To feed
  canals," is characteristic, if not altogether authentic.</p>

  <p><b>BRINTON, DANIEL GARRISON</b> (1837-1899), American archaeologist
  and ethnologist, was born at Thornbury, Pennsylvania, on the 13th of May
  1837. He graduated at Yale in 1858, studied for two years in the
  Jefferson Medical College, and then for one year travelled in Europe and
  continued his studies at Paris and Heidelberg. From 1862 to 1865, during
  the Civil War in America, he was a surgeon in the Union army, acting for
  one year, 1864-1865, as surgeon in charge of the U.S. Army general
  hospital at Quincy, Illinois. After the war he practised medicine at
  Westchester, Pennsylvania, for several years; was the editor of a weekly
  periodical, the <i>Medical and Surgical Reporter</i>, in Philadelphia,
  from 1874 to 1887; became professor of ethnology and archaeology in the
  Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia in 1884, and was professor of
  American linguistics and archaeology in the university of Pennsylvania
  from 1886 until his death at Philadelphia on the 31st of July 1899. He
  was a member of numerous learned societies in the United States and in
  Europe, and was president at different times of the Numismatic and
  Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia, of the American Folk-Lore Society
  and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. During
  the period from 1859 (when he published his first book) to 1899, he wrote
  a score of books, several of them of great value, and a large number of
  pamphlets, brochures, addresses and magazine articles. His principal
  works are:&mdash;<i>The Myths of the New World</i> (1868), the first
  attempt to analyse and correlate, according to true scientific
  principles, the mythology of the American Indians; <i>The Religious
  Sentiment: Its Sources and Aim: A Contribution to the Science and
  Philosophy of Religion</i> (1876); <i>American Hero Myths</i> (1882);
  <i>Essays of an Americanist</i> (1890); <i>Races and Peoples</i> (1890);
  <i>The American Race</i> (1891); <i>The Pursuit of Happiness</i> (1893);
  and <i>Religions of Primitive People</i> (1897). In addition, he edited
  and published a <i>Library of American Aboriginal Literature</i> (8 vols.
  1882-1890), a valuable contribution to the science of anthropology in
  America. Of the eight volumes, six were edited by Brinton himself, one by
  Horatio Hale and one by A.S. Gatschet.</p>

  <p><b>BRINVILLIERS, MARIE MADELEINE MARGUERITE D'AUBRAY,</b> <span
  class="sc">Marquise de</span> (<i>c.</i> 1630-1676), French poisoner,
  daughter of Dreux d'Aubray, civil lieutenant of Paris, was born in Paris
  about 1630. In 1651 she married the marquis de Brinvilliers, then serving
  in the regiment of Normandy. Contemporary evidence describes the marquise
  at this time as a pretty and much-courted little woman, with a
  fascinating air of childlike innocence. In 1659 her husband introduced
  her to his friend Godin de Sainte-Croix, a handsome young cavalry officer
  of extravagant tastes and bad reputation, whose mistress she became.
  Their relations soon created a public scandal, and as the marquis de
  Brinvilliers, who had left France to avoid his creditors, made no effort
  to terminate them, M. d'Aubray secured the arrest of Sainte-Croix on a
  <i>lettre de cachet</i>. For a year Sainte-Croix remained a prisoner in
  the Bastille, where he is popularly supposed to have acquired a knowledge
  of poisons from his fellow-prisoner, the Italian poisoner Exili. When he
  left the Bastille, he plotted with his willing mistress his revenge upon
  her father. She cheerfully undertook to experiment with the poisons which
  Sainte-Croix, possibly with the help of a chemist, Christopher Glaser,
  prepared, and found subjects ready to hand in the poor who sought her
  charity, and the sick whom she visited in the hospitals. Meanwhile
  Sainte-Croix, completely ruined financially, enlarged his original idea,
  and determined that not only M. Dreux d'Aubray but also the latter's two
  sons and other daughter should be poisoned, so that the marquise de
  Brinvilliers and himself might come into possession of the large family
  fortune. In February 1666, satisfied with the efficiency of
  Sainte-Croix's preparations and with the ease with which they could be
  administered without detection, the marquise poisoned her father, and in
  1670, with the connivance of their valet La Chaussée, her two brothers. A
  post-mortem examination suggested the real cause of death, but no
  suspicion was directed to the murderers. Before any attempt could be made
  on the life of Mlle Théresè d'Aubray, Sainte-Croix suddenly died. As he
  left no heirs the police were called in, and discovered among his
  belongings documents seriously incriminating the marquise and La
  Chaussée. The latter was arrested, tortured into a complete confession,
  and broken alive on the wheel (1673), but the marquise escaped, taking
  refuge first probably in England, then in Germany, and finally in a
  convent at Liége, whence she was decoyed by a police emissary disguised
  as a priest. A full account of her life and crimes was found among her
  papers. Her attempt to commit suicide was frustrated, and she was taken
  to Paris, where she was beheaded and her body burned on the 16th of July
  1676.</p>

  not only for the palaces and bridges of Venice and the whole Adriatic
  coast, but latterly for Vienna and Berlin also. As they command the
  entrance to the naval harbour of Pola, a strong fortress, "Fort
  Tegetthoff," has been erected on the largest of them (Brioni), together
  with minor fortifications on some of the others. The islands are
  inhabited by about 100 Italian quarrymen.</p>

  <p><b>BRIOSCO, ANDREA</b> (<i>c.</i> 1470-1532), Italian sculptor and
  architect, known as Riccio ("curly-headed"), was born at Padua. In
  architecture he is known by the church of Sta Giustina in his native
  city, but he is most famous as a worker in metal. His masterpieces are
  the bronze Paschal candelabrum (11 ft. high) in the choir of the Santo
  (S. Antonio) at Padua (1515), and the two bronze reliefs (1507) of "David
  dancing before the Ark" and "Judith and Holofernes" in the same church.
  His bronze and marble tomb of the physician Girolamo della Torre in San
  Fermo at Verona was beautifully decorated with reliefs, which were taken
  away by the French and are now in the Louvre. A number of other works
  which emanated from his workshop are attributed to him; and he has been
  suggested, but doubtfully, as the author of a fine bronze relief, a
  "Dance of Nymphs," in the Wallace collection at Hertford House,
  London.</p>

  <p><b>BRIOUDE,</b> a town of central France, capital of an arrondissement
  in the department of Haute-Loire, on the left bank of the Allier, 1467
  ft. above the sea, 47 m. N.W. of Le Puy on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop.
  (1906) 4581. Brioude has to a great extent escaped modernization and
  still has many old houses and fountains. Its streets are narrow and
  irregular, but the town is surrounded by wide boulevards lined with
  trees. The only building of consequence is the church of St Julian (12th
  and 13th centuries) in the Romanesque style of Auvergne, of which the
  choir, with its apse and radiating chapels and the mosaic ornamentation
  of the exterior, is a fine example. Brioude is the seat of a sub-prefect,
  and of tribunals of first instance and of commerce. The plain in which it
  is situated is of great fertility; the grain trade of the town is
  considerable, and market-gardening is carried on in the outskirts. The
  industries include brewing, saw-milling, lace-making and antimony mining
  and founding.</p>

  <p>Brioude, the ancient <i>Brinas</i>, was formerly a place of
  considerable importance. It was in turn besieged and captured by the
  Goths (532), the Burgundians, the Saracens (732) and the Normans. In 1181
  the viscount of Polignac, who had sacked the town two years previously,
  made public apology in front of the church, and established a body of
  twenty-five knights to defend the relics of St Julian. For some time
  after 1361 the town was the headquarters of Bérenger, lord of Castelnau,
  who was at the head of one of the bands of military adventurers which
  then devastated France. The knights (or canons, as they afterwards
  became) of St Julian bore the title of counts of Brioude, and for a long
  time opposed themselves to the civic liberties of the inhabitants.</p>

  <p><b>BRIQUEMAULT</b> (or <span class="sc">Briquemaut</span>),
  <b>FRANÇOIS DE BEAUVAIS,</b> <span class="sc">Seigneur de</span>
  (<i>c.</i> 1502-1572), leader of the Huguenots during the first religious
  wars, was the son of Adrien de Briquemault and Alexane de Sainte Ville,
  and was born about 1502. His first campaign was under the count of
  Brissac in the Piedmontese wars. On his return to France in 1554 he
  joined Admiral Coligny. Charged with the defence of Rouen, in 1562, he
  resigned in favour of Montgomery, to whom the prince of Condé had
  entrusted the task, and went over to England, where he concluded the
  treaty of Hampton Court on the 20th of September. He then returned to
  France, and took Dieppe from the Catholics before the conclusion of
  peace. If his share in the second religious war was less important, he
  played a very active part in the third. He fought at Jarnac,
  Roche-Abeille and Montcontour, assisted in the siege of Poitiers, was
  nearly captured by the Catholics at Bourg-Dieu, re-victualled Vézelay,
  and almost surprised Bourges. In 1570, being charged by Coligny to stop
  the army of the princes in its ascent of the Rhone valley, he crossed
  Burgundy and effected his junction with the admiral at St. Étienne in
  May. On the 21st of the following June he assisted in achieving the
  victory of Arnay-le-Duc, and was then employed to negotiate a marriage
  between the prince of Navarre and Elizabeth of England. Being in Paris on
  the night of St Bartholomew he took refuge in the house of the English
  ambassador, but was arrested there. With his friend Arnaud da Cavagnes he
  was delivered over to the parlement, and failed in courage when
  confronted with his judges, seeking to escape death by unworthy means. He
  was condemned, nevertheless, on the 27th of October 1572, to the last
  penalty and to the confiscation of his property, and on the 29th of
  October he and Cavagnes were executed.</p>

  <p><b>BRIQUETTE</b> (diminutive of Fr. <i>brique</i>, brick), a form of
  fuel, known also as "patent fuel," consisting of small coal compressed
  into solid blocks by the aid of some binding material. For making
  briquettes the small coal, if previously washed, is dried to reduce the
  moisture to at most 4%, and if necessary crushed in a disintegrator. It
  is then incorporated in a pug mill with from 8 to 10% of gas pitch, and
  softened by heating to between 70° and 90° C. to a plastic mass, which is
  moulded into blocks and compacted by a pressure of ½ to 2 tons per sq.
  in. in a machine with a rotating die-plate somewhat like that used in
  making semi-plastic clay bricks. When cold, the briquettes, which usually
  weigh from 7 to 20 lb each, although smaller sizes are made for domestic
  use, become quite hard, and can be handled with less breakage than the
  original coal. Their principal use is as fuel for marine and locomotive
  boilers, the evaporative value being about the same as, or somewhat
  greater than, that of coal. The principal seat of the manufacture in
  Great Britain is in South Wales, where the dust and smalls resulting from
  the handling of the best steam coals (which are very brittle) are
  obtainable in large quantities and find no other use. Some varieties of
  lignite, when crushed and pressed at a steam heat, soften sufficiently to
  furnish compact briquettes without requiring any cementing material.
  Briquettes of this kind are made to a large extent from the tertiary
  lignites in the vicinity of Cologne; they are used mainly for house fuel
  on the lower Rhine and in Holland, and occasionally come to London.</p>

  <p><b>BRISBANE, SIR THOMAS MAKDOUGALL</b> (1773-1860), Scottish soldier
  and astronomer, was born on the 23rd of July 1773 at Brisbane House, near
  Largs, in Ayrshire. He entered the army in 1789, and served in Flanders,
  the West Indies and the Peninsula. In 1814 he was sent to North America;
  on the return of Napoleon from Elba he was recalled, but did not arrive
  in time to take part in the battle of Waterloo. In 1821 he was appointed
  governor of New South Wales. During the four years for which he held that
  office, although he allowed the finances of the colony to get into
  confusion, he endeavoured to improve its condition by introducing the
  vine, sugar-cane and tobacco plant, and by encouraging the breeding of
  horses and the reclamation of land. At his instigation exploring parties
  were sent out, and one of these discovered the Brisbane river which was
  named after him. He established an astronomical observatory at Paramatta
  in 1822, and the <i>Brisbane Catalogue</i>, which was printed in 1835 and
  contained 7385 stars, was the result of observations made there in
  1822-1826. The observatory was discontinued in 1855. After his return to
  Scotland he resided chiefly at Makerstoun in Roxburghshire, where, as at
  Brisbane House, he had a large and admirably equipped observatory.
  Important magnetic observations were begun at Makerstoun in 1841, and the
  results gained him in 1848 the Keith prize of the Royal Society of
  Edinburgh, in whose <i>Transactions</i> they were published. In 1836 he
  was made a baronet, and G.C.B. in 1837; and in 1841 he became general. He
  was elected president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh after the death
  of Sir Walter Scott in 1833, and in the following year acted as president
  of the British Association. He died at Brisbane House on the 27th of
  January 1860. He founded two gold medals for the encouragement of
  scientific research, one in the <!-- Page 574 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  in Stanley county, on the banks of the river Brisbane, 25 m. from its
  mouth in Moreton Bay. It is built on a series of hills rising from the
  river-banks, but some parts of it, such as Woollongabba and South
  Brisbane, occupy low-lying flats, which have sometimes been the scene of
  disastrous floods. The main streets and principal buildings of the city
  are situated on a tongue of land formed by a southward bend of the river.
  The extremity of the tongue, however, is open. Here, adjoining one
  another, are the botanical gardens, the grounds surrounding Government
  House, the official residence of the governor of the colony, and the
  Houses of Parliament, and Queen's Park, which is used as a recreation
  ground. From this park Albert Street runs for about three-quarters of a
  mile through the heart of the city, leading to Albert Park, in which is
  the observatory. Queen's Street, the main thoroughfare of Brisbane,
  crosses Albert Street midway between the two parks and leads across the
  Victoria Bridge to the separate city of South Brisbane on the other side
  of the river. The Victoria Bridge is a fine steel structure, which
  replaced the bridge swept away by floods in February 1893. Brisbane has a
  large number of buildings of architectural merit, though in some cases
  their effect is marred by the narrowness of the streets in which they
  stand. Among the most prominent are the Houses of Parliament, the great
  domed custom-house on the river-bank, the lands office, the general
  post-office, the town halls of Brisbane and South Brisbane, and the opera
  house. The Roman Catholic cathedral of St Stephen (Elizabeth Street) is
  an imposing building, having a detached campanile containing the largest
  bell in Australia. The foundation-stone of the Anglican cathedral, on an
  elevated site in Ann Street, was laid by the prince of Wales (as duke of
  York) in 1901. The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop and of
  an Anglican bishop. Many of the commercial and private buildings are also
  worthy of notice, especially the Queensland National Bank, a classic
  Italian structure, the massive treasury buildings, one of the largest
  erections in Australia, the Queensland Club with its wide colonnades in
  Italian Renaissance style, and the great buildings of the Brisbane
  Newspaper Company. Brisbane is well provided with parks and open spaces;
  the Victoria Park and Bowen Park are the largest; the high-lying Mount
  Coot-tha commands fine views, and there are other parks and numerous
  recreation grounds in various parts of the city, besides the admirable
  botanical gardens and the gardens of the Acclimatization Society.
  Electric tramways and omnibuses serve all parts of the city, and numerous
  ferries ply across the river. There is railway communication to north,
  south and west. By careful dredging, the broad river is navigable as far
  as Brisbane for ocean-going vessels, and the port is the terminal port
  for the Queensland mail steamers to Europe, and is visited by steamers to
  China, Japan and America, and for various inter-colonial lines. There is
  wharf accommodation on both banks of the river, a graving dock which can
  be used by vessels up to 5000 tons, and two patent slips which can take
  up ships of 1000 and 400 tons respectively. The exports are chiefly coal,
  sheep, tallow, wool, frozen meat and hides. The annual value of imports
  and exports exceeds seven and nine millions sterling respectively. There
  are boot factories, soap works, breweries, tanneries, tobacco works,
  &amp;c. The climate is on the whole dry and healthy, but during summer
  the temperature is high, the mean shade temperature being about 70°
  F.</p>

  <p>Brisbane was founded in 1825 as a penal settlement, taking its name
  from Sir Thomas Brisbane, then governor of Australia; in 1842 it became a
  free settlement and in 1859 capital of Queensland, the town up to that
  time having belonged to New South Wales. It was incorporated in the same
  year. South Brisbane became a separate city in 1903. The municipal
  government of the city, and also of South Brisbane, is in the hands of a
  mayor and ten alderman; the suburbs are controlled by shire councils and
  divisional boards. The chief suburbs are Kangaroo Point, Fortitude
  Valley, New Farm, Red Hill, Paddington, Milon, Toowong, Breakfast Creek,
  Bulimba, Woolongabba, Highgate and Indooroopilly. The population of the
  metropolitan area in 1901 was 119,907; of the city proper, 28,953; of
  South Brisbane, 25,481.</p>

  decorations&mdash;mantelpieces, mirrors, doors and overdoors, ceilings,
  consoles, candelabra, wall panellings and other fittings, chiefly in the
  Louis Quinze mode. He was also an industrious writer on architectural
  subjects. His principal works are:&mdash;<i>L'Architecture moderne</i> (2
  vols., 1728); <i>L'Art de bâtir les maisons de campagne</i> (2 vols.,
  1743); <i>Traité du beau essentiel dans les arts, appliqué

  <p><b>BRISSAC, DUKES OF.</b> The fief of Brissac in Anjou was acquired at
  the end of the 15th century by a noble French family named Cossé
  belonging to the same province. René de Cossé married into the Gouffier
  family, just then very powerful at court, and became <i>premier
  panelier</i> (chief pantler) to Louis XII. Two of his sons were marshals
  of France. Brissac was made a countship in 1560 for Charles, the eldest,
  who was grandmaster of artillery, and governor of Piedmont and of
  Picardy. The second, Artus, who held the offices of <i>grand panetier</i>
  of France and superintendent of finance, distinguished himself in the
  religious wars. Charles II. de Cossé fought for the League, and as
  governor of Paris opened the gates of that town to Henry IV., who created
  him marshal of France in 1594. Brissac was raised to a duchy in the
  peerage of France in 1611. Louis Hercule Timoléon de Cossé, due de
  Brissac, and commandant of the constitutional guard of Louis XVI., was
  killed at Versailles on the 9th of September 1792 for his devotion to the
  king.</p>

  <p><b>BRISSON, EUGÈNE HENRI</b> (1835- ), French statesman, was born at
  Bourges on the 31st of July 1835. He followed his father's profession of
  advocate, and having made himself conspicuous in opposition during the
  last days of the empire, was appointed deputy-mayor of Paris after its
  overthrow. He was elected to the Assembly on the 8th of February 1871, as
  a member of the extreme Left. While not approving of the Commune, he was
  the first to propose amnesty for the condemned (on the 13th of September
  1871), but the proposal was voted down. He strongly supported obligatory
  primary education, and was a firm anti-clerical. He was president of the
  chamber from 1881&mdash;replacing Gambetta&mdash;to March 1885, when he
  became prime minister upon the resignation of Jules Ferry; but he
  resigned when, after the general elections of that year, he only just
  obtained a majority for the vote of credit for the Tongking expedition.
  He remained conspicuous as a public man, took a prominent part in
  exposing the Panama scandals, was a powerful candidate for the presidency
  after the murder of President Carnot in 1894, and was again president of
  the chamber from December 1894 to 1898. In June of the latter year he
  formed a cabinet when the country was violently excited over the Dreyfus
  affair; his firmness and honesty increased the respect in which he was
  already held by good citizens, but a chance vote on an occasion of
  especial excitement overthrew his ministry in October. As one of the
  leaders of the radicals he actively supported the ministries of
  Waldeck-Rousseau and Combes, especially concerning the laws on the
  religious orders and the separation of church and state. In 1899 he was a
  candidate for the presidency. In May 1906 he was elected president of the
  chamber of deputies by 500 out of 581 votes.</p>

  <p><b>BRISSON, MATHURIN JACQUES</b> (1723-1806), French zoologist and
  natural philosopher, was born at Fontenay le Comte on the 30th of April
  1723. The earlier part of his life was spent in the pursuit of natural
  history, his published works in this department including <i>Le Règne
  animal</i> (1756) and <i>Ornithologie</i> (1760). After the death of
  R.A.F. Réaumur (1683-1757), whose assistant he was, he abandoned natural
  history, and was appointed professor of natural philosophy at Navarre and
  later at Paris. His most important work in this department was his
  <i>Poids spécifiques des corps</i> (1787), but he published several other
  books on physical subjects which were in considerable repute for a time.
  He died at Croissy near Paris, on the 23rd of June 1806.</p>

  <p><b>BRISSOT, JACQUES PIERRE</b> (1754-1793), who assumed the name of
  <span class="sc">de Warville</span>, a celebrated French Girondist, was
  born at Chartres, where his father was an inn-keeper, in January 1754.
  Brissot received a good education and entered the office of a lawyer at
  Paris. His first works, <i>Théorie des lois criminelles</i> (1781) and
  <i>Bibliothèque philosophique du législateur</i> (1782), were on the
  philosophy of law, and showed how thoroughly Brissot was imbued with the
  ethical precepts of Rousseau. The first work was dedicated to Voltaire,
  and was received by the old <i>philosophe</i> with much favour. Brissot
  became known as a facile and able writer, and was engaged on the
  <i>Mercure</i>, on the <i>Courrier de l'Europe</i>, and on other papers.
  Ardently devoted to the service of humanity, he projected a scheme for a
  general concourse of all the savants in Europe, and started in London a
  paper, <i>Journal du Lycée de Londres</i>, which was to be the organ of
  their views. The plan was unsuccessful, and soon after his return to
  Paris Brissot was lodged in the Bastille on the charge of having
  published a work against the government. He obtained his release after
  four months, and again devoted himself to pamphleteering, but had
  speedily to retire for a time to London. On this second visit he became
  acquainted with some of the leading Abolitionists, and founded later in
  Paris a Société des Amis des Noirs, of which he was president during 1790
  and 1791. As an agent of this society he paid a visit to the United
  States in 1788, and in 1791 published his <i>Nouveau Voyage dans les
  États-Unis de l'Amerique Septentrionale</i> (3 vols.).</p>

  <p>From the first, Brissot threw himself heart and soul into the
  Revolution. He edited the <i>Patriote français</i> from 1789 to 1793, and
  being a well-informed and capable man took a prominent part in affairs.
  Upon the demolition of the Bastille the keys were presented to him.
  Famous for his speeches at the Jacobin club, he was elected a member of
  the municipality of Paris, then of the Legislative Assembly, and later of
  the National Convention. During the Legislative Assembly his knowledge of
  foreign affairs enabled him as member of the diplomatic committee
  practically to direct the foreign policy of France, and the declaration
  of war against the emperor on the 20th of April 1792, and that against
  England on the 1st of July 1793, were largely due to him. It was also
  Brissot who gave these wars the character of revolutionary propaganda. He
  was in many ways the leading spirit of the Girondists, who were also
  known as Brissotins. Vergniaud certainly was far superior to him in
  oratory, but Brissot was quick, eager, impetuous, and a man of wide
  knowledge. But he was at the same time vacillating, and not qualified to
  struggle against the fierce energies roused by the events of the
  Revolution. His party fell before the Mountain; sentence of arrest was
  passed against the leading members of it on the 2nd of June 1793. Brissot
  attempted to escape in disguise, but was arrested at Moulins. His
  demeanour at the trial was quiet and dignified; and on the 31st of
  October 1793 he died bravely with several other Girondists.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL, EARLS AND MARQUESSES OF.</b> This English title has been
  held in the Hervey family since 1714, though previously an earldom of
  Bristol, in the Digby family, is associated with two especially famous
  representatives, of whom separate biographies are given. The Herveys are
  mentioned during the 13th century as seated in Bedfordshire, and
  afterwards in Suffolk, where they have held the estate of Ickworth since
  the 15th century. John Hervey (1616-1679) was the eldest son of Sir
  William Hervey (d. 1660), and was born on the 18th of August 1616. He
  held a high position in the household of Catherine, wife of Charles II.,
  and was for many years member of parliament for Hythe. He married
  Elizabeth, the only surviving child of his kinsman, William, Lord Hervey
  of Kidbrooke (d. 1642), but left no children when he died on the 18th of
  January 1679, and his estates passed to his brother, Sir Thomas Hervey.
  Sir Thomas, who was member of parliament for Bury St Edmunds, died on the
  27th of May 1694, and was succeeded by his son, John, who became the 1st
  earl of Bristol.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">John Hervey</span>, 1st earl of Bristol (1665-1751),
  born on the 27th of August 1665, was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge,
  and became member of parliament for Bury St Edmunds in March 1694. In
  March 1703 he was created Baron Hervey of Ickworth, and in October 1714
  was made earl of Bristol as a reward for his zeal in promoting the
  principles of the revolution and supporting the Hanoverian succession. He
  died on the 20th of January 1751. By his first wife, Isabella (d. 1693),
  daughter of Sir Robert Carr, Bart., of Sleaford, he had one son, Carr,
  Lord Hervey (1691-1723), who was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and
  was member for Bury St Edmunds from 1713 to 1722. (It has been suggested
  that Carr, who died unmarried on the 14th of November 1723, was the
  father of Horace Walpole.) He married secondly Elizabeth (d. 1741),
  daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Felton, Bart., of Playford,
  Suffolk, by whom he had ten sons and six daughters. His eldest son, John
  (1696-1743), took the courtesy title of Lord Hervey on the death of his
  half-brother, Carr, in 1723, and gained some renown both as a writer and
  a politician (see <span class="sc">Hervey of Ickworth</span>). Another
  son, Thomas (1699-1775), was one of the members for Bury from 1733 to
  1747; held various offices at court; and eloped with Elizabeth, wife of
  Sir Thomas Hanmer. He had very poor health, and his reckless life
  frequently brought him into pecuniary and other difficulties. He wrote
  numerous pamphlets, and when he died Dr Johnson said of him, "Tom Hervey,
  though a vicious man, was one of the genteelest men who ever lived."
  Another of the 1st earl's sons, Felton (1712-1773), was also member for
  the family borough of Bury St Edmunds. Having assumed the additional name
  of Bathurst, Felton's grandson, Felton Elwell Hervey-Bathurst
  (1782-1819), was created a baronet in 1818, and on his death a year later
  the title descended to his brother, Frederick Anne (1783-1824), the
  direct ancestor of the present baronet. The 1st earl died in January
  1751, the title and estates descending to his grandson.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">George William Hervey</span>, 2nd earl of Bristol
  (1721-1775), the eldest son of John, Lord Hervey of Ickworth, by his
  marriage with Mary (1700-1768), daughter of Nicholas Lepell, was born on
  the 31st of August 1721. He served for some years in the army, and in
  1755 was sent to Turin as envoy extraordinary. He was ambassador at
  Madrid from 1758 to 1761, filling a difficult position with credit and
  dignity, and ranked among the followers of Pitt. Appointed
  lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1766, he never visited that country during
  his short tenure of this office, and, after having served for a short
  time as keeper of the privy seal, became groom of the stole to George
  III. in January 1770. He died unmarried on the 18th or 20th of March
  1775, and was succeeded by his brother.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Augustus John Hervey</span>, 3rd earl of Bristol
  (1724-1779), was born on the 19th of May 1724, and entered the navy,
  where his promotion was rapid. He distinguished himself in several
  encounters with the French, and was of great assistance to Admiral Hawke
  in 1759, although he had returned to England before the battle of
  Quiberon Bay in November 1759. Having served with distinction in the West
  Indies under Rodney, his active life at sea ceased when the peace of
  Paris was concluded in February 1763. He was, however, nominally
  commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean in this year, and was made
  vice-admiral of the blue in January 1778. Hervey was member of parliament
  for Bury from 1757 to 1763, and after being for a short time member for
  Saltash, again represented Bury from 1768 until he succeeded his brother
  in the peerage in 1775. He often took part in debates in parliament, and
  was a frequent contributor to periodical literature. Having served as a
  lord of the admiralty from 1771 to 1775 he won some notoriety as an
  opponent of the Rockingham ministry and a defender of Admiral Keppel. In
  August 1744 he had been secretly married to Elizabeth Chudleigh
  (1720-1788), afterwards duchess of Kingston (<i>q.v.</i>), but this union
  was dissolved in 1769. The earl died in London on the 23rd of December
  1779, leaving no legitimate issue, and having, as far as possible,
  alienated his property from the <!-- Page 576 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page576"></a>[v.04 p.0576]</span>title. He was succeeded by his
  brother. Many of his letters are in the Record Office, and his journals
  in the British Museum. Other letters are printed in the <i>Grenville
  Papers</i>, vols. iii. and iv. (London, 1852-1853), and the <i>Life of
  Admiral Keppel</i>, by the Hon. T. Keppel (London, 1852).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Frederick Augustus Hervey</span>, bishop of Derry
  (1730-1803), who now became 4th earl of Bristol, was born on the 1st of
  August 1730, and educated at Westminster school and Corpus Christi
  College, Cambridge, graduating in 1754. Entering the church he became a
  royal chaplain; and while waiting for other preferment spent some time in
  Italy, whither he was led by his great interest in art. In February 1767,
  while his brother, the 2nd earl, was lord-lieutenant of Ireland, he was
  made bishop of Cloyne, and having improved the property of the see he was
  translated to the rich bishopric of Derry a year later. Here again he was
  active and philanthropic. While not neglecting his luxurious personal
  tastes he spent large sums of money on making roads and assisting
  agriculture, and his munificence was shared by the city of Londonderry.
  He built splendid residences at Downhill and Ballyscullion, which he
  adorned with rare works of art. As a bishop, Hervey was industrious and
  vigilant; he favoured complete religious equality, and was opposed to the
  system of tithes. In December 1779 he became earl of Bristol, and in
  spite of his brother's will succeeded to a considerable property. Having
  again passed some time in Italy, he returned to Ireland and in 1782 threw
  himself ardently into the Irish volunteer movement, quickly attaining a
  prominent position among the volunteers, and in great state attending the
  convention held in Dublin in November 1783. Carried away by his position
  and his popularity he talked loudly of rebellion, and his violent
  language led the government to contemplate his arrest. Subsequently he
  took no part in politics, spending his later years mainly on the
  continent of Europe. In 1798 he was imprisoned by the French at Milan,
  remaining in custody for eighteen months. He died at Albano on the 8th of
  July 1803, and was buried in Ickworth church. Varying estimates have been
  found of his character, including favourable ones by John Wesley and
  Jeremy Bentham. He was undoubtedly clever and cultured, but licentious
  and eccentric. In later life he openly professed materialistic opinions;
  he fell in love with the countess Lichtenau, mistress of Frederick
  William II., king of Prussia; and by his bearing he gave fresh point to
  the saying that "God created men, women and Herveys." In 1752 he had
  married Elizabeth (d. 1800), daughter of Sir Jermyn Davers, Bart., by
  whom he had two sons and three daughters. His elder son, Augustus John,
  Lord Hervey (1757-1796), had predeceased his father, and he was succeeded
  in the title by his younger son.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Frederick William Hervey</span>, 5th earl and 1st
  marquess of Bristol (1769-1859), was born on the 2nd of October 1769. He
  married Elizabeth Albana (d. 1844), daughter of Clotworthy, 1st Baron
  Templetown, by whom he had six sons and three daughters. In 1826 he was
  created marquess of Bristol and Earl Jermyn, and died on the 15th of
  February 1859. He was succeeded by his son Frederick William (1800-1864),
  M.P. for Bury St Edmunds 1830-1859, as 2nd marquess; and by the latter's
  son Frederick William John (1834-1907), M.P. for West Suffolk 1859-1864,
  as 3rd marquess. The latter's nephew, Frederick William Fane Hervey (b.
  1863), who succeeded as 4th marquess, served with distinction in the
  royal navy, and was M.P. for Bury St Edmunds from 1906 to 1907.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL, GEORGE DIGBY,</b> <span class="sc">2nd Earl of</span><a
  name="FnAnchor_071" href="#Footnote_071"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (1612-1677),
  eldest son of the 1st earl (see below), was born in October 1612. At the
  age of twelve he appeared at the bar of the House of Commons and pleaded
  for his father, then in the Tower, when his youth, graceful person and
  well-delivered speech made a great impression. He was admitted to
  Magdalen College, Oxford, on the 15th of August 1626, where he was a
  favourite pupil of Peter Heylin, and became M.A. in 1636. He spent the
  following years in study and in travel, from which he returned, according
  to Clarendon, "the most accomplished person of our nation or perhaps any
  other nation," and distinguished by a remarkably handsome person. In 1638
  and 1639 were written the <i>Letters between Lord George Digby and Sir
  Kenelm Digby, Knt. concerning Religion</i> (publ. 1651), in which Digby
  attacked Roman Catholicism. In June 1634 Digby was committed to the Fleet
  till July for striking Crofts, a gentleman of the court, in Spring
  Gardens; and possibly his severe treatment and the disfavour shown to his
  father were the causes of his hostility to the court. He was elected
  member for Dorsetshire in both the Short and Long parliaments in 1640,
  and in conjunction with Pym and Hampden he took an active part in the
  opposition to Charles. He moved on the 9th of November for a committee to
  consider the "deplorable state" of the kingdom, and on the 11th was
  included in the committee for the impeachment of Strafford, against whom
  he at first showed great zeal. He, however, opposed the attainder, made
  an eloquent speech on the 21st of April 1641, accentuating the weakness
  of Vane's evidence against the prisoner, and showing the injustice of
  <i>ex post facto</i> legislation. He was regarded in consequence with
  great hostility by the parliamentary party, and was accused of having
  stolen from Pym's table Vane's notes on which the prosecution mainly
  depended. On the 15th of July his speech was burnt by the hangman by the
  order of the House of Commons. Meanwhile on the 8th of February he had
  made an important speech in the Commons advocating the reformation and
  opposing the abolition of episcopacy. On the 8th of June, during the
  angry discussion on the army plot, he narrowly escaped assault in the
  House; and the following day, in order to save him from further attacks,
  the king called him up to the Lords in his father's barony of Digby.</p>

  <p>He now became the evil genius of Charles, who had the incredible folly
  to follow his advice in preference to such men as Hyde and Falkland. In
  November he is recorded as performing "singular good service," and "doing
  beyond admiration," in speaking in the Lords against the instruction
  concerning evil counsellors. He suggested to Charles the impeachment of
  the five members, and urged upon him the fatal attempt to arrest them on
  the 4th of January 1642; but he failed to play his part in the Lords in
  securing the arrest of Lord Mandeville, to whom on the contrary he
  declared that "the king was very mischievously advised"; and according to
  Clarendon his imprudence was responsible for the betrayal of the king's
  plan. Next day he advised the attempt to seize them in the city by force.
  The same month he was ordered to appear in the Lords to answer a charge
  of high treason for a supposed armed attempt at Kingston, but fled to
  Holland, where he joined the queen, and on the 26th of February was
  impeached. Subsequently he visited Charles at York disguised as a
  Frenchman, but on the return voyage to Holland he was captured and taken
  to Hull, where he for some time escaped detection; and at last he cajoled
  Sir John Hotham, after discovering himself, into permitting his escape.
  Later he ventured on a second visit to Hull to persuade Hotham to
  surrender the place to Charles, but this project failed. He was present
  at Edgehill, and greatly distinguished himself at Lichfield, where he was
  wounded while leading the assault. He soon, however, threw down his
  commission in consequence of a quarrel with Prince Rupert, and returned
  to the king at Oxford, over whom he obtained more influence as the
  prospect became more gloomy. On the 28th of September 1643 he was
  appointed secretary of state and a privy councillor, and on the 31st of
  October high steward of Oxford University. He now supported the queen's
  disastrous policy of foreign alliances and help from Ireland, and engaged
  in a series of imprudent and ill-conducted negotiations which greatly
  injured the king's affairs, while his fierce disputes with Rupert and his
  party further embarrassed them. On the 14th of October 1645 he was made
  lieutenant general of the royal forces north of the Trent, with the
  object of pushing through to join Montrose, but he was defeated on <!--
  Page 577 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page577"></a>[v.04
  p.0577]</span>the 15th at Sherburn, where his correspondence was
  captured, disclosing the king's expectations from abroad and from Ireland
  and his intrigues with the Scots; and after reaching Dumfries, he found
  his way barred. He escaped on the 24th to the Isle of Man, thence
  crossing to Ireland, where he caused Glamorgan to be arrested. Here, on
  this new stage, he believed he was going to achieve wonders. "Have I not
  carried my body swimmingly," he wrote to Hyde in irrepressible good
  spirits, "who being before so irreconcilably hated by the Puritan party,
  have thus seasonably made myself as odious to the Papists?"<a
  name="FnAnchor_072" href="#Footnote_072"><sup>[2]</sup></a> His project
  now was to bring over Prince Charles to head a royalist movement in the
  island; and having joined Charles at Jersey in April 1646, he intended to
  entrap him on board, but was dissuaded by Hyde. He then travelled to
  Paris to gain the queen's consent to his scheme, but returned to persuade
  Charles to go to Paris, and accompanied him thither, revisiting Ireland
  on the 29th of June once more, and finally escaping to France on the
  surrender of the island to the parliament. At Paris amongst the royalists
  he found himself in a nest of enemies eager to pay off old scores. Prince
  Rupert challenged him, and he fought a duel with Lord Wilmot. He
  continued his adventures by serving in Louis XIV.'s troops in the war of
  the Fronde, in which he greatly distinguished himself. He was appointed
  in 1651 lieutenant-general in the French army, and commander of the
  forces in Flanders. These new honours, however, were soon lost. During
  Mazarin's enforced absence from the court Digby aspired to become his
  successor; and the cardinal, who had from the first penetrated his
  character and regarded him as a mere adventurer,<a name="FnAnchor_073"
  href="#Footnote_073"><sup>[3]</sup></a> on his restoration to power sent
  Digby away on an expedition in Italy; and on his return informed him that
  he was included in the list of those expelled from France, in accordance
  with the new treaty with Cromwell. In August 1656 he joined Charles II.
  at Bruges, and desirous of avenging himself upon the cardinal offered his
  services to Don John of Austria in the Netherlands, being instrumental in
  effecting the surrender of the garrison of St Ghislain to Spain in 1657.
  On the 1st of January 1657 he was appointed by Charles II. secretary of
  state, but shortly afterwards, having become a Roman
  Catholic&mdash;probably with the view of adapting himself better to his
  new Spanish friends&mdash;he was compelled to resign office. Charles,
  however, on account of his "jollity" and Spanish experience took him with
  him to Spain in 1659, though his presence was especially deprecated by
  the Spanish; but he succeeded in ingratiating himself, and was welcomed
  by the king of Spain subsequently at Madrid.</p>

  <p>By the death of his father Digby had succeeded in January 1659 to the
  peerage as 2nd earl of Bristol, and had been made K.G. the same month. He
  returned to England at the restoration, when he found himself excluded
  from office on account of his religion, and relegated to only secondary
  importance. His desire to make a brilliant figure induced a restless and
  ambitious activity in parliament. He adopted an attitude of violent
  hostility to Clarendon. In foreign affairs he inclined strongly to the
  side of Spain, and opposed the king's marriage with Catherine of
  Portugal. He persuaded Charles to despatch him to Italy to view the
  Medici princesses, but the royal marriage and treaty with Portugal were
  settled in his absence. In June 1663 he made an attempt to upset
  Clarendon's management of the House of Commons, but his intrigue was
  exposed to the parliament by Charles, and Bristol was obliged to attend
  the House to exonerate himself, when he confessed that he had "taken the
  liberty of enlarging," and his "comedian-like speech" excited general
  amusement. Exasperated by these failures, in a violent scene with the
  king early in July, he broke out into fierce and disrespectful
  reproaches, ending with a threat that unless Charles granted his requests
  within twenty-four hours "he would do somewhat that should awaken him out
  of his slumbers, and make him look better to his own business."
  Accordingly on the 10th he impeached Clarendon in the Lords of high
  treason, and on the charge being dismissed renewed his accusation, and
  was expelled from the court, only avoiding the warrant issued for his
  apprehension by a concealment of two years. In January 1664 he caused a
  new sensation by his appearance at his house at Wimbledon, where he
  publicly renounced before witnesses his Roman Catholicism, and declared
  himself a Protestant, his motive being probably to secure immunity from
  the charge of recusancy preferred against him.<a name="FnAnchor_074"
  href="#Footnote_074"><sup>[4]</sup></a> When, however, the fall of
  Clarendon was desired, Bristol was again welcomed at court. He took his
  seat in the Lords on the 29th of July 1667. "The king," wrote Pepys in
  November, "who not long ago did say of Bristoll that he was a man able in
  three years to get himself a fortune in any kingdom in the world and lose
  all again in three months, do now hug him and commend his parts
  everywhere above all the world."<a name="FnAnchor_075"
  href="#Footnote_075"><sup>[5]</sup></a> He pressed eagerly for
  Clarendon's commital, and on the refusal of the Lords accused them of
  mutiny and rebellion, and entered his dissent with "great fury."<a
  name="FnAnchor_076" href="#Footnote_076"><sup>[6]</sup></a> In March 1668
  he attended prayers in the Lords. On the 15th of March 1673 though still
  ostensibly a Roman Catholic, he spoke in favour of the Test Act,
  describing himself as "a Catholic of the church of Rome, not a Catholic
  of the court of Rome," and asserting the unfitness of Romanists for
  public office. His adventurous and erratic career closed by death on the
  20th of March 1677.</p>

  <p>Bristol was one of the most striking and conspicuous figures of his
  time, a man of brilliant abilities, a great orator, one who distinguished
  himself without effort in any sphere of activity he chose to enter, but
  whose natural gifts were marred by a restless ambition and instability of
  character fatal to real greatness. Clarendon describes him as "the only
  man I ever knew of such incomparable parts that was none the wiser for
  any experience or misfortune that befell him," and records his
  extraordinary facility in making friends and making enemies. Horace
  Walpole characterized him in a series of his smartest antitheses as "a
  singular person whose life was one contradiction." "He wrote against
  popery and embraced it; he was a zealous opposer of the court and a
  sacrifice for it; was conscientiously converted in the midst of his
  prosecution of Lord Strafford and was most unconscientiously a persecutor
  of Lord Clarendon. With great parts, he always hurt himself and his
  friends; with romantic bravery, he was always an unsuccessful commander.
  He spoke for the Test Act, though a Roman Catholic; and addicted himself
  to astrology on the birthday of true philosophy." Besides his youthful
  correspondence with Sir K. Digby on the subject of religion already
  mentioned, he was the author of an <i>Apologie</i> (1643, Thomason
  Tracts, E. 34 (32)), justifying his support of the king's cause; of
  <i>Elvira ... a comedy</i> (1667), printed in R. Dodsley's <i>Select
  Collect. of Old English Plays</i> (Hazlitt, 1876), vol. xv., and of
  <i>Worse and Worse</i>, an adaptation from the Spanish, acted but not
  printed. Other writings are also ascribed to him, including the
  authorship with Sir Samuel Tuke of <i>The Adventures of Five Hours</i>
  (1663). His eloquent and pointed speeches, many of which were printed,
  are included in the article in the <i>Biog. Brit.</i> and among the
  <i>Thomason Tracts</i>; see also the general catalogue in the British
  Museum. The catalogue of his library was published in 1680. He married
  Lady Anne Russell, daughter of Francis, 4th earl of Bedford, by whom,
  besides two daughters, he had two sons, Francis, who predeceased him
  unmarried, and John, who succeeded him as 3rd earl of Bristol, at whose
  death without issue the peerage became extinct.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL, JOHN DIGBY,</b> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span><a
  name="FnAnchor_081" href="#Footnote_081"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (1580-1653)
  English diplomatist, son of Sir George Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire,
  and of Abigail, daughter of Sir Arthur Henningham, was born in <!-- Page
  578 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page578"></a>[v.04
  p.0578]</span>1580, and entered Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1595 (M.A.
  1605), becoming a member of the Inner Temple in 1598. In 1605 he was sent
  to James to inform him of the safety of the princess Elizabeth at the
  time of the Gunpowder Plot. He gained his favour, was made a gentleman of
  the privy chamber and one of the king's carvers, and was knighted in
  1607. From 1610 to 1611 he was member of parliament for Heydon. In 1611
  he was sent as ambassador to Spain to negotiate a marriage between Prince
  Henry and the infanta Anne, and to champion the cause of the English
  merchants, for whom he obtained substantial concessions, and arranged the
  appointment of consuls at Lisbon and Seville. He also discovered a list
  of the English pensioners of the Spanish court, which included some of
  the ministers, and came home in 1613 to communicate this important
  intelligence to the king. In 1614 he again went to Spain to effect a
  union between the infanta Maria and Charles, though he himself was in
  favour of a Protestant marriage, and desired a political and not a
  matrimonial treaty. In 1616, on the disgrace of Somerset, he was recalled
  home to give evidence concerning the latter's connexions with Spain, was
  made vice-chamberlain and a privy councillor, and obtained from James the
  manor of Sherborne forfeited by the late favourite. In 1618 he went once
  more to Spain to reopen the negotiations, returning in May, and being
  created Baron Digby on the 25th of November. He endeavoured to avoid a
  breach with Spain on the election of the elector palatine, the king's
  son-in-law, to the Bohemian throne; and in March 1621, after the latter's
  expulsion from Bohemia, Digby was sent to Brussels to obtain a suspension
  of hostilities in the Palatinate. On the 4th of July he went to Vienna
  and drew up a scheme of pacification with the emperor, by which Frederick
  was to abandon Bohemia and be secured in his hereditary territories, but
  the agreement could never be enforced. After raising money for the
  defence of Heidelberg he returned home in October, and on the 21st of
  November explained his policy to the parliament, and asked for money and
  forces for its execution. The sudden dissolution of parliament, however,
  prevented the adoption of any measure of support, and entirely ruined
  Digby's plans. In 1622 he returned to Spain with nothing on which to rely
  but the goodwill of Philip IV., and nothing to offer but entreaties.</p>

  <p>On the 15th of September he was created earl of Bristol. He urged on
  the marriage treaty, believing it would include favourable conditions for
  Frederick, but the negotiations were taken out of his control, and
  finally wrecked by the arrival of Charles himself and Buckingham in March
  1623. He incurred their resentment, of which the real inspiration was
  Buckingham's implacable jealousy, by a letter written to James informing
  him of Buckingham's unpopularity among the Spanish ministers, and by his
  endeavouring to maintain the peace with Spain after their departure. In
  January 1624 he left Spain, and on arriving at Dover in March, Buckingham
  and Charles having now complete ascendancy over the king, he was
  forbidden to appear at court and ordered to confine himself at Sherborne.
  He was required by Buckingham to answer a series of interrogatories, but
  he refused to inculpate himself and demanded a trial by parliament. On
  the death of James he was removed by Charles I. from the privy council,
  and ordered to absent himself from his first parliament. On his demand in
  January 1626 to be present at the coronation Charles angrily refused, and
  accused him of having tried to pervert his religion in Spain. In March
  1626, after the assembling of the second parliament, Digby applied to the
  Lords, who supported his rights, and Charles sent him his writ
  accompanied by a letter from Lord Keeper Coventry desiring him not to use
  it. Bristol, however, took his seat and demanded justice against
  Buckingham (Thomason Tracts, E. 126 (20)). The king endeavoured to
  obstruct his attack by causing Bristol on the 1st of May to be himself
  brought to the bar, on an accusation of high treason by the
  attorney-general. The Lords, however, ordered that both charges should be
  investigated simultaneously. Further proceedings were stopped by the
  dissolution of parliament on the 15th of June; a prosecution was ordered
  by Charles in the Star Chamber, and Bristol was sent to the Tower, where
  he remained till the 17th of March 1628, when the peers, on the
  assembling of Charles's third parliament, insisted on his liberation and
  restoration to his seat in the Lords.</p>

  <p>In the discussions upon the Petition of Right, Bristol supported the
  use of the king's prerogative in emergencies, and asserted that the king
  besides his legal had a regal power, but joined in the demand for a full
  acceptance of the petition by the king after the first unsatisfactory
  answer. He was now restored to favour, but took no part in politics till
  the outbreak of the Scottish rebellion, when he warned Charles of the
  danger of attacking with inadequate forces. He was the leader in the
  Great Council held at York, was a commissioner to treat with the Scots in
  September 1640 at Ripon, and advised strongly the summoning of the
  parliament. In February 1641 he was one of the peers who advocated
  reforms in the administration and were given seats in the council. Though
  no friend to Strafford, he endeavoured to save his life, desiring only to
  see him excluded from office, and as a witness was excused from voting on
  the attainder. He was appointed gentleman of the bedchamber on the king's
  departure for Scotland, and on the 27th of December he was declared an
  evil counsellor by the House of Commons, Cromwell on the 28th moving an
  address to the king to dismiss him from his councils, on the plea that he
  had advocated the bringing up of the northern army to overawe parliament
  in the preceding spring. There is no evidence to support the charge, but
  Digby was regarded by the parliamentary party with special hatred and
  distrust, of which the chief causes were probably his Spanish
  proclivities and his indifference on the great matter of religion, to
  which was added the unpopularity reflected from his misguided son. On the
  28th of March 1642 he was sent to the Tower for having failed to disclose
  to parliament the Kentish petition. Liberated in April, he spoke in the
  Lords on the 20th of May in favour of an accommodation, and again in June
  in vindication of the king; but finding his efforts ineffectual, and
  believing all armed rebellion against the king a wicked violation of the
  most solemn oaths, he joined Charles at York, was present at Edgehill and
  accompanied him to Oxford. On the 1st of February 1643 he was named with
  Lord Herbert of Raglan for removal from the court and public office for
  ever, and in the propositions of November 1644 was one of those excepted
  from pardon. In January he had endeavoured to instigate a breach of the
  Independents with the Scots. Bristol, however, was not in favour of
  continuing the war, and withdrew to Sherborne, removing in the spring of
  1644 to Exeter, and after the surrender of the city retiring abroad on
  the 11th of July by order of the Houses, which rejected his petition to
  compound for his estate. He took up his residence at Caen, passing the
  rest of his life in exile and poverty, and occasionally attending the
  young king. In 1647 he printed at Caen <i>An Apology</i>, defending his
  support of the royal cause. This was reprinted in 1656 (Thomason Tracts,
  E. 897, 6). He died at Paris on the 16th of January 1653.</p>

  <p>He is described by Clarendon as "a man of grave aspect, of a presence
  that drew respect, and of great parts and ability, but passionate and
  supercilious and too voluminous a discourser in council." His aim was to
  effect a political union between England and Spain apart from the
  religious or marriage questions&mdash;a policy which would probably have
  benefited both English and European interests; but it was one understood
  neither in Spain nor in England, and proved impracticable. He was a man
  of high character, who refused to compound with falsehood and injustice,
  whose misfortune it was to serve two Stuart sovereigns, and whose firm
  resistance to the king's tyranny led the way to the great movement which
  finally destroyed it. Besides his <i>Apology</i>, he was the author of
  several printed speeches and poems, and translated <i>A Defence of the
  Catholic Faith</i> by Peter du Moulin (1610). He married Beatrix,
  daughter of Charles Walcot, and widow of Sir John Dyve, and besides two
  daughters left two sons, George, who succeeded him as 2nd earl of
  Bristol, and John, who died unmarried.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL,</b> a township of Hartford county, Connecticut, U.S.A., in
  the central part of the state, about 16 m. S.W. of Hartford. It has an
  area of 27 sq. m., and contains the village of Forestville and the
  borough of Bristol (incorporated in 1893). Both are situated on the
  Pequabuck river, and are served by the western branch of the midland
  division of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford railway, and by
  electric railway to Hartford, New Britain and Terryville. Pop. (1890)
  7382; (1900) 9643, including that of the borough, 6268 (1910) 13,502
  (borough, 9527). Among the manufactures of the borough of Bristol are
  clocks, woollen goods, iron castings, hardware, brass ware, silverplate
  and bells. Bristol clocks, first manufactured soon after the War of
  Independence, have long been widely known. Bristol, originally a part of
  the township of Farmington, was first settled about 1727, but did not
  become an independent corporation until the formation, in 1742, of the
  first church, known after 1744 as the New Cambridge Society. In 1748 a
  Protestant Episcopal Church was organized, and before and during the War
  of Independence its members belonged to the Loyalist party; their rector,
  Rev. James Nichols, was tarred and feathered by the Whigs, and Moses
  Dunbar, a member of the church, was hanged for treason by the Connecticut
  authorities. Chippen's Hill (about 3 m. from the centre of the township)
  was a favourite rendezvous of the local Loyalists; and a cave there,
  known as "The Tories' Den," is a well-known landmark. In 1785 New
  Cambridge and West Britain, another ecclesiastical society of Farmington,
  were incorporated as the township of Bristol, but in 1806 they were
  divided into the present townships of Bristol and Burlington.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL,</b> a city, county of a city, municipal, county and
  parliamentary borough, and seaport of England, chiefly in Gloucestershire
  but partly in Somersetshire, 118½ m. W. of London. Pop. (1901) 328,945.
  The Avon, here forming the boundary between Gloucestershire and Somerset,
  though entering the estuary of the Severn (Bristol Channel) only 8 m.
  below the city, is here confined between considerable hills, with a
  narrow valley-floor on which the nucleus of the city rests. Between
  Bristol and the Channel the valley becomes a gorge, crossed at a single
  stride by the famous Clifton Suspension Bridge. Above Bristol the hills
  again close in at Keynsham, so that the city lies in a basin-like hollow
  some 4 m. in diameter, and extends up the heights to the north. The Great
  Western railway, striking into the Avon valley near Bath, serves Bristol
  from London, connects it with South Wales by the Severn tunnel, and with
  the southern and south-western counties of England. Local lines of this
  company encircle the city on the north and the south, serving the
  outports of Avonmouth and Portishead on the Bristol Channel. A trunk line
  of the Midland railway connects Bristol with the north of England by way
  of Gloucester, Worcester, Birmingham and Derby. Both companies use the
  central station, Temple Meads.</p>

  <p>The nucleus of Bristol lies to the north of the river. The business
  centre is in the district traversed by Broad Street, High Street, Wine
  Street and Corn Street, which radiate from a centre close to the Floating
  Harbour. To the south of this centre, connected with it by Bristol
  Bridge, an island is formed between the Floating Harbour and the New
  Course of the Avon, and here are Temple Meads station, above Victoria
  Street, two of the finest churches (the Temple and St Mary Redcliffe) the
  general hospital and other public buildings. Immediately above the bridge
  the little river Frome joins the Avon. Owing to the nature of the site
  the streets are irregular; in the inner part of the city they are
  generally narrow, and sometimes, with their ancient gabled houses,
  extremely picturesque. The principal suburbs surround the city to the
  west, north and east.</p>

  <p><i>Churches, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In the centre of Bristol a remarkable
  collection of architectural antiquities is found, principally
  ecclesiastical. This the city owes mainly to a few great baronial
  families, such as the earls of Gloucester and the Berkeleys, in its early
  history, and to a few great merchants, the Canyngs, Shipwards and
  Framptons, in its later career. The see of Bristol, founded by Henry
  VIII. in 1542, was united to that of Gloucester in 1836; but again
  separated in 1896. The diocese includes parts of Gloucestershire and
  Wiltshire, and a small but populous <span
  class="sidenote">Cathedral.</span> portion of Somerset. The cathedral,
  standing above the so-called Canons' Marsh which borders the Floating
  Harbour, is pleasantly situated on the south side of College Green. It
  has two western towers and a central tower, nave, short transepts, choir
  with aisles, an eastern Lady chapel and other chapels; and on the south,
  a chapter-house and cloister court. The nave is modern (by Street, 1877),
  imitating the choir of the 14th century, with its curious
  skeleton-vaulting in the aisles. Besides the canopied tombs of the
  Berkeleys with their effigies in chain mail, and similarly fine tombs of
  the crosiered abbots, there are memorials to Bishop Butler, to Sterne's
  Eliza (Elizabeth Draper), and to Lady Hesketh (the friend of Cowper), who
  are all interred here. There is also here William Mason's fine epitaph to
  his wife (d. 1767), beginning "Take, holy earth, all that my soul holds
  dear." Of Fitz-Harding's abbey of St Augustine, founded in 1142 (of which
  the present cathedral was the church), the stately entrance gateway, with
  its sculptured mouldings, remains hardly injured. The abbot's gateway,
  the vestibule to the chapter-house, and the chapter-house itself, which
  is carved with Byzantine exuberance of decoration, and acknowledged to be
  one of the finest Norman chambers in Europe, are also perfect. On the
  north side of College Green is the small but ornate Mayor's chapel
  (originally St Mark's), devoted to the services of the mayor and
  corporation. It is mainly Decorated and Perpendicular. Of the churches
  within the centre of the city, the following are found within a radius of
  half-a-mile from Bristol Bridge. St Stephen's church, built between 1450
  and 1490, is a dignified structure, chiefly interesting for its
  fan-traceried porch and stately tower. It was built entirely by the
  munificence of John Shipward, a wealthy merchant. The tower and spire of
  St John's (15th century) stand on one of the gateways of the city. This
  church is a parallelogram, without east or west windows or aisles, and is
  built upon a fine groined crypt. St James's church, the burial place of
  its founder, Robert, earl of Gloucester, dates from 1130, and fine Norman
  work remains in the nave. The tower is of the 14th century. St Philip's
  has an Early English tower, but its external walls and windows are for
  the most part debased Perpendicular. Robert FitzHamon's Norman tower of
  St Peter, the oldest church tower in Bristol, still presents its massive
  square to the eye. This church stands in Castle Street, which
  commemorates the castle of Robert, earl of Gloucester, the walls of which
  were 25 ft. thick at the base. Nothing remains of this foundation, but
  there still exist some walls and vaults of the later stronghold,
  including a fine Early English cell. Adjacent to the church is St Peter's
  hospital, a picturesque gabled building of Jacobean and earlier date,
  with a fine court room. St Mary le Port and St Augustine the Less are
  churches of the Perpendicular era, and not the richest specimens of their
  kind. St Nicholas church is modern, on a crypt of the date 1503, and
  earlier. On the island south of the Floating Harbour are two of the most
  interesting churches in the city. Temple church, with its leaning tower,
  5 ft. off the perpendicular, retains nothing of the Templars' period, but
  is a fine building of the Decorated and Perpendicular periods. The church
  of <!-- Page 580 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page580"></a>[v.04
  p.0580]</span>St Mary Redcliffe, for grandeur of proportion and
  elaboration of design and finish, is the first ecclesiastical building in
  Bristol, and takes high rank among the parish churches of England. It was
  built for the most part in the latter part of the 14th century by William
  Canyng or Canynges (<i>q.v.</i>), but the sculptured north porch is
  externally Decorated, and internally Early English. The fine tower is
  also Decorated, on an Early English base. The spire, Decorated in style,
  is modern. Among numerous monuments is that of Admiral Penn (d. 1718),
  the father of the founder of Pennsylvania. The church exhibits the rare
  feature of transeptal aisles. Of St Thomas's, in the vicinity, only the
  tower (15th century) remains of the old structures. All Hallows church
  has a modern Italian campanile, but is in the main of the 15th century,
  with the retention of four Norman piers in the nave; and is interesting
  from its connexion with the ancient gild of calendars, whose office it
  was "to convert Jews, instruct youths," and keep the archives of the
  town. Theirs was the first free library in the city, possibly in England.
  The records of the church contain a singularly picturesque representation
  of the ancient customs of the fraternity.</p>

  <p>Among conventual remains, besides those already mentioned, there exist
  of the Dominican priory the Early English refectory and dormitory, the
  latter comprising a row of fifteen original windows and an oak roof of
  the same date; and of St Bartholomew's hospital there is a double arch,
  with intervening arcades, also Early English. These, with the small
  chapel of the Three Kings of Cologne, Holy Trinity Hospital, both
  Perpendicular, and the remains of the house of the Augustinian canons
  attached to the cathedral, comprise the whole of the monastic relics.</p>

  <p>There are many good specimens of ancient domestic
  architecture&mdash;notably some arches of a grand Norman hall and some
  Tudor windows of Colston's house, Small Street; and Canyng's house, with
  good Perpendicular oak roof. Of buildings to which historic interest
  attaches, there are the Merchant Venturers' almshouses (1699), adjoining
  their hall. This gild was established in the 16th century. A small house
  near St Mary Redcliffe was the school where the poet Chatterton received
  his education. His memorial is in the churchyard of St Mary, and in the
  church a chest contains the records among which he claimed to have
  discovered some of the manuscripts which were in reality his own. A house
  in Wine Street was the birthplace of the poet-laureate Robert Southey
  (1744).</p>

  <p><i>Public Buildings, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The public buildings are
  somewhat overshadowed in interest by the ecclesiastical. The council
  house, at the "Cross" of the four main thoroughfares, dates from 1827,
  was enlarged in 1894, and contains the city archives and many portraits,
  including a Van Dyck and a Kneller. The Guildhall is close by&mdash;a
  modern Gothic building. The exchange (used as a corn-market) is a
  noteworthy building by the famous architect of Bath, John Wood (1743).
  Edward Colston, a revered citizen and benefactor of the city (d. 1721),
  is commemorated by name in several buildings and institutions, notably in
  Colston Hall, which is used for concerts and meetings. A bank close by St
  Stephen's church claims to have originated in the first savings-bank
  established in England (1812). Similarly, the city free library (1613) is
  considered to be the original of its kind. The Bristol museum and
  reference library were transferred to the corporation in 1893. Vincent
  Stuckey Lean (d. 1899) bequeathed to the corporation of Bristol the sum
  of £50,000 for the further development of the free libraries of the city,
  and with especial regard to the formation and sustenance of a general
  reference library of a standard and scientific character. The central
  library was opened in 1906. An art gallery, presented by Sir William
  Henry Wills, was opened in 1905.</p>

  <p>Among educational establishments, the technical college of the Company
  of Merchant Venturers (1885) supplies scientific, technical and
  commercial education. The extensive buildings of this institution were
  destroyed by fire in 1906. University College (1876) forms the nucleus of
  the university of Bristol (chartered 1909). Clifton College, opened in
  1862 and incorporated in 1877, includes a physical science school, with
  laboratories, a museum and observatory. Colston's girls' day school
  (1891) includes domestic economy and calisthenics. Among the many
  charitable institutions are the general hospital, opened in 1858, and
  since repeatedly enlarged; royal hospital for sick children and women,
  Royal Victoria home, and the Queen Victoria jubilee convalescent
  home.</p>

  <p>Of the open spaces in and near Bristol the most extensive are those
  bordering the river in the neighbourhood of the gorge, Durdham and
  Clifton Downs, on the Gloucestershire side (see <span
  class="sc">Clifton</span>). Others are Victoria Park, south of the river,
  near the Bedminster station, Eastville Park by the Frome, on the
  north-east of the city beyond Stapleton Road station, St Andrew's Park
  near Montpelier station to the north, and Brandon Hill, west of the
  cathedral, an abrupt eminence commanding a fine view over the city, and
  crowned with a modern tower commemorating the "fourth centenary of the
  discovery of America by John Cabot, and sons Lewis, Sebastian and
  Sanctus." Other memorials in the city are the High Cross on College Green
  (1850), and statues of Queen Victoria (1888), Samuel Morley (1888),
  Edmund Burke (1894), and Edward Colston (1895), in whose memory are held
  annual Colston banquets.</p>

  <p><i>Harbour and Trade.</i>&mdash;Bristol harbour was formed in 1809 by
  the conversion of the Avon and a branch of the Frome into "the Float," by
  the cutting of a new channel for the Avon and the formation of two
  basins. Altogether the water area, at fixed level, is about 85 acres.
  Four dry docks open into the floating harbour. In 1884 the Avonmouth and
  Portishead docks at the river entrance were bought up by the city; and
  the port extends from Hanham Mills on the Avon to the mouth of the river,
  and for some distance down the estuary of the Severn. The city docks have
  a depth of 22 ft., while those at Avonmouth are accessible to the largest
  vessels. In 1902 the construction of the extensive Royal Edward dock at
  Avonmouth was put in hand by the corporation, and the dock was opened by
  King Edward VII. in 1908. It is entered by a lock 875 ft. long and 100
  ft. wide, with a depth of water on the sill of 46 ft. at ordinary spring,
  and 36 ft. at ordinary neap tides. The dock itself has a mean length of
  1120 ft. and a breadth of 1000 ft., and there is a branch and passage
  connecting with the old dock. The water area is about 30 acres, and the
  dock is so constructed as to be easily capable of extension. Portishead
  dock, on the Somerset shore, has an area of 12 acres. The port has a
  large trade with America, the West Indies and elsewhere, the principal
  imports being grain, fruit, oils, ore, timber, hides, cattle and general
  merchandise; while the exports include machinery, manufactured oils,
  cotton goods, tin and salt. The Elder Dempster, Dominion and other large
  steamship companies trade at the port.</p>

  <p>The principal industries are shipbuilding, ropewalks, chocolate
  factories, sugar refineries, tobacco mills and pipe-making, glass works,
  potteries, soaperies, shoe factories, leather works and tanneries,
  chemical works, saw mills, breweries, copper, lead and shot works, iron
  works, machine works, stained-paper works, anchors, chain cables,
  sail-cloth, buttons. A coalfield extending 16 m. south-east to Radstock
  avails much for Bristol manufactures.</p>

  <p>The parliamentary borough is divided into four divisions, each
  returning one member. The government of the city is in the hands of a
  lord mayor, 22 aldermen and 66 councillors. The area in 1901 was 11,705
  acres; but in 1904 it was increased to 17,004 acres.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Bristol (Brigstow, Bristou, Bristow, Bristole)
  is one of the best examples of a town that has owed its greatness
  entirely to trade. It was never a shire town or the site of a great
  religious house, and it owed little to its position as the head of a
  feudal lordship, or as a military post. Though it is near both British
  and Roman camps, there is no evidence of a British or Roman settlement.
  It was the western limit of the Saxon invasion of Britain, and about the
  year 1000 a Saxon settlement began to grow up at the junction of the
  rivers Frome and Avon, the natural advantages of the situation favouring
  the growth of the township. Bristol owed much to Danish rule, and during
  the reign of Canute, when the wool trade with <!-- Page 581 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page581"></a>[v.04 p.0581]</span>Ireland began,
  it became the market for English slaves. In the reign of Edward the
  Confessor the town was included in the earldom of Sweyn Godwinsson, and
  at the date of the Domesday survey it was already a royal borough
  governed by a reeve appointed by the king as overlord, the king's geld
  being assessed at 110 marks. There was a mint at the time of the
  Conquest, which proves that Bristol must have been already a place of
  some size, though the fact that the town was a member of the royal manor
  of Baston shows that its importance was still of recent growth. One-third
  of the geld was paid to Geoffrey de Coutances, bishop of Exeter, who
  threw up the earthworks of the castle. He joined in a rebellion against
  William II., and after his death the king granted the town and castle, as
  part of the honour of Gloucester, to Robert FitzHamon, whose daughter
  Mabel, marrying Earl Robert of Gloucester in 1119, brought him Bristol as
  her dowry. Earl Robert still further strengthened the castle, probably
  with masonry, and involved Bristol in the rebellion against Stephen. From
  the castle he harried the whole neighbourhood, threatened Bath, and sold
  his prisoners as slaves to Ireland. A contemporary chronicler describes
  Bristol castle as "seated on a mighty mound, and garrisoned with knights
  and foot soldiers or rather robbers and raiders," and he calls Bristol
  the stepmother of England.</p>

  <p>The history of the charters granted to Bristol begins about this time.
  A charter granted by Henry II. in 1172 exempted the burgesses of Bristol
  from certain tolls throughout the kingdom, and confirmed existing
  liberties. Another charter of the same year granted the city of Dublin to
  the men of Bristol as a colony with the same liberties as their own
  town.</p>

  <p>As a result probably of the close connexion between Bristol and
  Ireland the growth of the wool trade was maintained. Many Bristol men
  settled in Dublin, which for a long time was a Bristol beyond the seas,
  its charters being almost duplicates of those granted to Bristol. About
  this time Bristol began to export wool to the Baltic, and had developed a
  wine trade with the south of France, while soap-making and tanning were
  flourishing industries. Bristol was still organized manorially rather
  than municipally. Its chief courts were the weekly hundred court and the
  court leet held three times a year, and presided over by the reeve
  appointed by the earl of Gloucester. By the marriage of Earl John with
  the heiress of Earl William of Gloucester, Bristol became part of the
  royal demesne, the rent payable to the king being fixed, and the town
  shook off the feudal yoke. The charter granted by John in 1190 was an
  epoch in the history of the borough. It provided that no burgess should
  be impleaded without the walls, that no non-burgess should sell wine,
  cloth, wool, leather or corn in Bristol, that all should hold by burgage
  tenure, that corn need not be ground at the lord's mill, and that the
  burgesses should have all their reasonable gilds. At some uncertain date
  soon after this a commune was established in Bristol on the French model,
  Robert FitzNichol, the first mayor of Bristol, taking the oath in 1200.
  The mayor was chosen, not, like the reeve whom he had displaced, by the
  overlord, but by the merchants of Bristol who were members of the
  merchant gild. The first documentary evidence of the existence of the
  merchant gild appears in 1242. In addition, there were many craft gilds
  (later at least twenty-six were known to exist), the most important being
  the gilds of the weavers, tuckers and fullers, and the Gild of the
  Kalendars of Bristol, which devoted itself to religious, educational and
  social work. The mayor of Bristol was helped by two assistants, who were
  called provosts until 1267, and from 1267 to 1311 were known as stewards,
  and after that date as bailiffs. Before this time many religious houses
  had been founded. Earl Robert of Gloucester established the Benedictine
  priory of St James; there were Dominican and Franciscan priories, a
  monastery of Carmelites, and an abbey of St Augustine founded by Robert
  FitzHardinge.</p>

  <p>In the reign of John, Bristol began the struggle to absorb the
  neighbouring manor of Bedminster, the eastern half of which was held by
  the Templars by gift of Earl Robert of Gloucester, and the western half,
  known as Redcliffe, was sold by the same earl to Robert FitzHardinge,
  afterwards Lord Berkeley. The Templars acquiesced without much
  difficulty, but the wealthy owners of the manor of Redcliffe, who had
  their own manorial courts, market, fair and quay, resisted the union for
  nearly one hundred years. In 1247 a new course was cut for the river
  Frome which vastly improved the harbour, and in the same year a stone
  bridge was built over the Avon, bringing Temple and Redcliffe into closer
  touch with the city. The charter granted by Henry III. in 1256 was
  important. It gave the burgesses the right to choose coroners, and as
  they already farmed the geld payable to the king, Bristol must have been
  practically independent of the king. The growing exclusiveness of the
  merchant gild led to the great insurrection of 1312. The oligarchical
  party was supported by the Berkeleys, but the opposition continued their
  rebellion until 1313, when the town was besieged and taken by the royal
  forces. During the reign of Edward III. cloth manufacture developed in
  Bristol. Thomas Blanket set up looms in 1337, employing many foreign
  workmen, and in 1353 Bristol was made one of the Staple towns, the office
  of mayor of the staple being held by the mayor of the town.</p>

  <p>The charter of 1373 extended the boundaries of the town to include
  Redcliffe (thus settling the long-standing dispute) and the waters of the
  Avon and Severn up to the Steep and Flat Holmes; and made Bristol a
  county in itself, independent of the county courts, with an elected
  sheriff, and a council of forty to be chosen by the mayor and sheriff.
  The town was divided into five wards, each represented by an alderman,
  the aldermen alone being eligible for the mayoralty. This charter
  (confirmed in 1377 and 1488) was followed by the period of Bristol's
  greatest prosperity, the era of William Canyng, of the foundation of the
  Society of Merchant Venturers, and of the voyages of John and Sebastian
  Cabot. William Canyng (1399-1474) was five times mayor and twice
  represented Bristol in parliament; he carried on a huge cloth trade with
  the Baltic and rebuilt St Mary Redcliffe. At the same time cloth was
  exported by Bristol merchants to France, Spain and the Levant. The
  records of the Society of Merchant Venturers began in 1467, and the
  society increased in influence so rapidly that in 1500 it directed all
  the foreign trade of the city and had a lease of the port dues. It was
  incorporated in 1552, and received other charters in 1638 and 1662. Henry
  VII. granted Bristol a charter in 1499 (confirmed in 1510) which removed
  the theoretically popular basis of the corporation by the provision that
  the aldermen were to be elected by the mayor and council. At the
  dissolution of the monasteries the diocese of Bristol was founded, which
  included the counties of Bristol and Dorset. The voyages of discovery in
  which Bristol had played a conspicuous part led to a further trade
  development. In the 16th century Bristol traded with Spain, the Canaries
  and the Spanish colonies in America, shared in the attempt to colonize
  Newfoundland, and began the trade in African slaves which flourished
  during the 17th century. Bristol took a great share in the Civil War and
  was three times besieged. Charles II. granted a formal charter of
  incorporation in 1664, the governing body being the mayor, 12 aldermen,
  30 common councilmen, 2 sheriffs, 2 coroners, a town clerk, clerk of the
  peace and 39 minor officials, the governing body itself filling up all
  vacancies in its number. In the 18th century the cloth trade declined
  owing to the competition of Ireland and to the general migration of
  manufactures to the northern coalfields, but the prosperity of the city
  was maintained by the introduction of manufactures of iron, brass, tin
  and copper, and by the flourishing West Indian trade, sugar being taken
  in exchange for African slaves.</p>

  <p>The hot wells became fashionable in the reign of Anne (who granted a
  charter in 1710), and a little later Bristol was the centre of the
  Methodist revival of Whitefield and Wesley. The city was small, densely
  populated and dirty, with dark, narrow streets, and the mob gained an
  unenviable notoriety for violence in the riots of 1708, 1753, 1767 and
  1831. At the beginning of the 19th century it was obvious that the
  prosperity of Bristol was diminishing, comparatively if not actually,
  owing to (1) the rise of Liverpool, which had more natural facilities as
  a port than Bristol could offer, (2) the abolition of the slave trade,
  <!-- Page 582 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page582"></a>[v.04
  p.0582]</span>which ruined the West Indian sugar trade, and (3) the
  extortionate rates levied by the Bristol Dock Company, incorporated in
  1803. These rates made competition with Liverpool and London impossible,
  while other tolls were levied by the Merchant Venturers and the
  corporation. The decline was checked by the efforts of the Bristol
  chamber of commerce (founded in 1823) and by the Municipal Reform Act of
  1835. The new corporation, consisting of 48 councillors and 16 aldermen
  who elected the mayor, being themselves chosen by the burgesses of each
  ward, bought the docks in 1848 and reduced the fees. In 1877-1880 the
  docks at the mouth of the river at Avonmouth and Portishead were made,
  and these were bought by the corporation in 1884. A revival of trade,
  rapid increase of population and enlargement of the boundaries of the
  city followed. The chief magistrate became a lord mayor in 1899.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL,</b> a borough of Bucks county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on
  the Delaware river, opposite Burlington, New Jersey, 20 m. N.E. of
  Philadelphia. Pop. (1890) 6553; (1900) 7104 (1134 foreign-born); (1910)
  9256. It is served by the Pennsylvania railway. The borough is built on
  level ground elevated several feet above the river, and in the midst of
  an attractive farming country. The principal business houses are on Mill
  Street; while Radcliffe Street extends along the river. Among Bristol's
  manufacturing establishments are machine shops, rolling mills, a planing
  mill, yarn, hosiery and worsted mills, and factories for making carpets,
  wall paper and patent leather. Bath Springs are located just outside the
  borough limits; though not so famous as they were early in the 18th
  century, these springs are still well known for the medicinal properties
  of their chalybeate waters. Bristol was one of the first places to be
  settled in Pennsylvania after William Penn received his charter for the
  province in 1681, and from its settlement until 1725 it was the seat of
  government of the county. It was laid out in 1697 and was incorporated as
  a borough in 1720; the present charter, however, dates only from
  1851.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL,</b> the shire-township of Bristol county, Rhode Island,
  U.S.A., about 15 m. S.S.E. of Providence, between Narragansett Bay on the
  W. and Mount Hope Bay on the E., thus being a peninsula. Pop. (1900)
  6901, of whom 1923 were foreign-born; (1905; state census) 7512; (1910)
  8565; area 12 sq. m. It is served by the New York, New Haven &amp;
  Hartford, and the Rhode Island Suburban railways, and is connected with
  the island of Rhode Island by ferry. Mount Hope (216 ft.), on the eastern
  side, commands delightful views of landscape, bay and river scenery.
  Elsewhere in the township the surface is gently undulating and generally
  well adapted to agriculture, especially to the growing of onions. A small
  island, Hog Island, is included in the township. The principal village,
  also known as Bristol, is a port of entry with a capacious and deep
  harbour, has manufactories of rubber and woollen goods, and is well known
  as a yacht-building centre, several defenders of the America's Cup,
  including the "Columbia" and the "Reliance," having been built in the
  Herreshoff yards here. At the close of King Philip's War in 1676, Mount
  Hope Neck (which had been the seat of the vanquished sachem), with most
  of what is now the township of Bristol, was awarded to Plymouth Colony.
  In 1680, immediately after Plymouth had conveyed the "Neck" to a company
  of four, the village was laid out; the following year, in anticipation of
  future commercial importance, the township and the village were named
  Bristol, from the town in England. The township became the shire-township
  in 1685, passed under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts in 1692, and in
  1747 was annexed to Rhode Island. During the War of Independence the
  village was bombarded by the British on the 7th of October 1775, but
  suffered little damage; on the 25th of May 1778 it was visited and
  partially destroyed by a British force.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOL,</b> a city of Sullivan county, Tennessee, and Washington
  county, Virginia, U.S.A., 130 m. N.E. of Knoxville, Tennessee, at an
  altitude of about 1700 ft. Pop. (1880) 3209; (1890) 6226; (1900) 9850
  (including 1981 negroes); (1910) 13,395, of whom 7148 were in Tennessee
  and 6247 were in Virginia. Bristol is served by the Holston Valley, the
  Southern, the Virginia &amp; South-Western, and the Norfolk &amp; Western
  railways, and is a railway centre of some importance. It is near the
  great mineral deposits of Virginia, Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky
  and North Carolina; an important distributing point for iron, coal and
  coke; and has tanneries and lumber mills, iron furnaces, tobacco
  factories, furniture factories and packing houses. It is the seat of
  Sullins College (Methodist Episcopal, South; 1870) for women, and of the
  Virginia Institute for Women (Baptist, 1884), both in the state of
  Virginia, and of a normal college for negroes, on the Tennessee side of
  the state line. The Tennessee-Virginia boundary line runs through the
  principal street, dividing the place into two separate corporations, the
  Virginia part, which before 1890 (when it was chartered as a city) was
  known as Goodson, being administratively independent of the county in
  which it is situated. Bristol was settled about 1835, and the town of
  Bristol, Tennessee, was first incorporated in 1856.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOW, BENJAMIN HELM</b> (1832-1896), American lawyer and
  politician, was born in Elkton, Kentucky, on the 20th of June 1832, the
  son of Francis Marion Bristow (1804-1864), a Whig member of Congress in
  1854-1855 and 1859-1861. He graduated at Jefferson College, Canonsburg,
  Pennsylvania, in 1851, studied law under his father, and was admitted to
  the Kentucky bar in 1853. At the beginning of the Civil War he became
  lieutenant-colonel of the 25th Kentucky Infantry; was severely wounded at
  Shiloh; helped to recruit the 8th Kentucky Cavalry, of which he was
  lieutenant-colonel and later colonel; and assisted at the capture of John
  H. Morgan in July 1863. In 1863-1865 he was state senator; in 1865-1866
  assistant United States district-attorney, and in 1866-1870
  district-attorney for the Louisville district; and in 1870-1872, after a
  few months' practice of law with John M. Harlan, was the (first
  appointed) solicitor-general of the United States. In 1873 President
  Grant nominated him attorney-general of the United States in case George
  H. Williams were confirmed as chief justice of the United States,&mdash;a
  contingency which did not arise. As secretary of the treasury (1874-1876)
  he prosecuted with vigour the so-called "Whisky Ring," the headquarters
  of which was at St Louis, and which, beginning in 1870 or 1871, had
  defrauded the Federal government out of a large part of its rightful
  revenue from the distillation of whisky. Distillers and revenue officers
  in St Louis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati and other cities were implicated, and
  the illicit gains&mdash;which in St Louis alone probably amounted to more
  than $2,500,000 in the six years 1870-1876&mdash;were divided between the
  distillers and the revenue officers, who levied assessments on distillers
  ostensibly for a Republican campaign fund to be used in furthering
  Grant's re-election. Prominent among the ring's alleged accomplices at
  Washington was Orville E. Babcock, private secretary to President Grant,
  whose personal friendship for Babcock led him to indiscreet interference
  in the prosecution. Through Bristow's efforts more than 200 men were
  indicted, a number of whom were convicted, but after some months'
  imprisonment were pardoned. Largely owing to friction between himself and
  the president, Bristow resigned his portfolio in June 1876; as secretary
  of the treasury he advocated the resumption of specie payments and at
  least a partial retirement of "greenbacks"; and he was also an advocate
  of civil service reform. He was a prominent candidate for the Republican
  presidential nomination in 1876. After 1878 he practised law in New York
  City, where he died on the 22nd of June 1896.</p>

  <p><b>BRISTOW, HENRY WILLIAM</b> (1817-1889), English geologist, son of
  Major-General H. Bristow, who served in the Peninsular War, was born on
  the 17th of May 1817. He was educated at King's College, London, under
  John Phillips, then professor of geology. In 1842 he was appointed
  assistant geologist on the Geological Survey, and in that service he
  remained for forty-six years, becoming director for England and Wales in
  1872, and retiring in 1888. He was elected F.R.S. in 1862. He died in
  London on the 14th of June 1889. His publications (see <i>Geol. Mag.</i>,
  1889, p. 384) include <i>A Glossary of Mineralogy</i> (1861) and <i>The
  Geology of the Isle of Wight</i> (1862).</p>

  <i>Britannia</i>, rarely <i>Brittania</i>), the anglicized form of the

  British Isles as a whole (<i>Britannicae Insulae</i>). The Greek and
  Roman forms are doubtless attempts to reproduce a Celtic original, the
  exact form of which is still matter of dispute. Brittany (Fr.
  <i>Bretagne</i>) in western France derived its name from Britain owing to
  migrations in the 5th and 6th century <span class="scac">A.D.</span> The
  personification of Britannia as a female figure may be traced back as far
  as the coins of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius (early 2nd century <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span>); its first appearance on modern coins is on the
  copper of Charles II. (see <span class="sc">Numismatics</span>).</p>

  <p>In what follows, the archaeological interest of early Britain is dealt
  with, in connexion with the history of Britain in Pre-Roman, Roman, and
  Anglo-Saxon days; this account being supplementary to the articles <span
  class="sc">England; English History; Scotland</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Pre-Roman Britain</span></h4>

  <p>Geologists are not yet agreed when and by whom Britain was first
  peopled. Probably the island was invaded by a succession of races. The
  first, the Paleolithic men, may have died out or retired before
  successors arrived. During the Neolithic and Bronze Ages we can dimly
  trace further immigrations. Real knowledge begins with two Celtic
  invasions, that of the Goidels in the later part of the Bronze Age, and
  that of the Brythons and Belgae in the Iron Age. These invaders brought
  Celtic civilization and dialects. It is uncertain how far they were
  themselves Celtic in blood and how far they were numerous enough to
  absorb or obliterate the races which they found in Britain. But it is not
  unreasonable to think that they were no mere conquering caste, and that
  they were of the same race as the Celtic-speaking peoples of the western
  continent. By the age of Julius Caesar all the inhabitants of Britain,
  except perhaps some tribes of the far north, were Celts in speech and
  customs. Politically they were divided into separate and generally
  warring tribes, each under its own princes. They dwelt in hill forts with
  walls of earth or rude stone, or in villages of round huts sunk into the
  ground and resembling those found in parts of northern Gaul, or in
  subterranean chambered houses, or in hamlets of pile-dwellings
  constructed among the marshes. But, at least in the south, market centres
  had sprung up, town life was beginning, houses of a better type were
  perhaps coming into use, and the southern tribes employed a gold coinage
  and also a currency of iron bars or ingots, attested by Caesar and by
  surviving examples, which weigh roughly, some two-thirds of a pound, some
  2&#x2154; lb, but mostly 1&#x2153; lb. In religion, the chief feature was
  the priesthood of Druids, who here, as in Gaul, practised magical arts
  and barbarous rites of human sacrifice, taught a secret lore, wielded
  great influence, but, at least as Druids, took ordinarily no part in
  politics. In art, these tribes possessed a native Late Celtic fashion,
  descended from far-off Mediterranean antecedents and more directly
  connected with the La-Tène culture of the continental Celts. Its
  characteristics were a flamboyant and fantastic treatment of plant and
  animal (though not of human) forms, a free use of the geometrical device
  called the "returning spiral," and much skill in enamelling. Its finest
  products were in bronze, but the artistic impulse spread to humbler work
  in wood and pottery. The late Celtic age was one which genuinely
  delighted in beauty of form and detail. In this it resembled the middle
  ages rather than the Roman empire or the present day, and it resembled
  them all the more in that its love of beauty, like theirs, was mixed with
  a feeling for the fantastic and the grotesque. The Roman conquest of
  northern Gaul (57-50 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) brought Britain into
  definite relation with the Mediterranean. It was already closely
  connected with Gaul, and when Roman civilization and its products invaded
  Gallia Belgica, they passed on easily to Britain. The British coinage now
  begins to bear Roman legends, and after Caesar's two raids (55, 54 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) the southern tribes were regarded at Rome,
  though they do not seem to have regarded themselves, as vassals. Actual
  conquest was, however, delayed. Augustus planned it. But both he and his
  successor Tiberius realized that the greater need was to consolidate the
  existing empire, and absorb the vast additions recently made to it by
  Pompey, Caesar and Augustus.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Roman Britain</span></h4>

  <p>I. <i>The Roman Conquest.</i>&mdash;The conquest of Britain was
  undertaken by Claudius in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 43. Two causes
  coincided to produce the step. On the one hand a forward policy then
  ruled at Rome, leading to annexations in various lands. On the other
  hand, a probably philo-Roman prince, Cunobelin (known to literature as
  Cymbeline), had just been succeeded by two sons, Caractacus (<i>q.v.</i>)
  and Togodumnus, who were hostile to Rome. Caligula, the half-insane
  predecessor of Claudius, had made in respect to this event some blunder
  which we know only through a sensational exaggeration, but which
  doubtless had to be made good. An immediate reason for action was the
  appeal of a fugitive British prince, presumably a Roman partisan and
  victim of Cunobelin's sons. So Aulus Plautius with a singularly well
  equipped army of some 40,000 men landed in Kent and advanced on London.
  Here Claudius himself appeared&mdash;the one reigning emperor of the 1st
  century who crossed the waves of ocean,&mdash;and the army, crossing the
  Thames, moved forward through Essex and captured the native capital,
  Camulod&#x16B;num, now Colchester. From the base of London and Colchester
  three corps continued the conquest. The left wing, the Second Legion
  (under Vespasian, afterwards emperor), subdued the south; the centre, the
  Fourteenth and Twentieth Legions, subdued the midlands, while the right
  wing, the Ninth Legion, advanced through the eastern part of the island.
  This strategy was at first triumphant. The lowlands of Britain, with
  their partly Romanized and partly scanty population and their easy
  physical features, presented no obstacle. Within three or four years
  everything south of the Humber and east of the Severn had been either
  directly annexed or entrusted, as protectorates, to native
  client-princes.</p>

  <p>A more difficult task remained. The wild hills and wilder tribes of
  Wales and Yorkshire offered far fiercer resistance. There followed thirty
  years of intermittent hill fighting (<span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  47-79). The precise steps of the conquest are not known. Legionary
  fortresses were established at Wroxeter (for a time only), Chester and
  Caerleon, facing the Welsh hills, and at Lincoln in the northeast.
  Monmouthshire, and Flintshire with its lead mines, were early overrun; in
  60 Suetonius Paulinus reached Anglesea. The method of conquest was the
  establishment of small detached forts in strategic positions, each
  garrisoned by 500 or 1000 men, and it was accompanied by a full share of
  those disasters which vigorous barbarians always inflict on civilized
  invaders. Progress was delayed too by the great revolt of Boadicea
  (<i>q.v.</i>) and a large part of the nominally conquered Lowlands. Her
  rising was soon crushed, but the government was obviously afraid for a
  while to move its garrisons forward. Indeed, other needs of the empire
  caused the withdrawal of the Fourteenth Legion about 67. But the decade
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 70-80 was decisive. A series of three able
  generals commanded an army restored to its proper strength by the
  addition of Legio II. Adiutrix, and achieved the final subjugation of
  Wales and the first conquest of Yorkshire, where a legionary fortress at
  York was substituted for that at Lincoln.</p>

  <p>The third and best-known, if not the ablest, of these generals, Julius
  Agricola, moved on in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 80 to the conquest
  of the farther north. He established between the Clyde and Forth a
  frontier meant to be permanent, guarded by a line of forts, <!-- Page 584
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page584"></a>[v.04 p.0584]</span>two of
  which are still traceable at Camelon near Falkirk, and at Bar Hill. He
  then advanced into Caledonia and won a "famous victory" at Mons Graupius
  (sometimes, but incorrectly, spelt Grampius), probably near the
  confluence of the Tay and the Isla, where a Roman encampment of his date,
  Inchtuthill, has been partly examined (see <span
  class="sc">Galgacus</span>). He dreamt even of invading Ireland, and
  thought it an easy task. The home government judged otherwise. Jealous
  possibly of a too brilliant general, certainly averse from costly and
  fruitless campaigns and needing the Legio II. Adiutrix for work
  elsewhere, it recalled both governor and legion, and gave up the more
  northerly of his nominal conquests. The most solid result of his
  campaigns is that his battlefield, misspelt Grampius, has provided to
  antiquaries, and through them to the world, the modern name of the
  Grampian Hills.</p>

  <p>What frontier was adopted after Agricola's departure, whether Tweed or
  Cheviot or other, is unknown. For thirty years (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 85-115) the military history of Britain is a
  blank. When we recover knowledge we are in an altered world. About 115 or
  120 the northern Britons rose in revolt and destroyed the Ninth Legion,
  posted at York, which would bear the brunt of any northern trouble. In
  122 the second reigning emperor who crossed the ocean, Hadrian, came
  himself to Britain, brought the Sixth Legion to replace the Ninth, and
  introduced the frontier policy of his age. For over 70 m. from Tyne to
  Solway, more exactly from Wallsend to Bowness, he built a continuous
  rampart, more probably of turf than of stone, with a ditch in front of
  it, a number of small forts along it, one or two outposts a few miles to
  the north of it, and some detached forts (the best-known is on the hill
  above Maryport) guarding the Cumberland coast beyond its western end. The
  details of his work are imperfectly known, for though many remains
  survive, it is hard to separate those of Hadrian's date from others that
  are later. But that Hadrian built a wall here is proved alike by
  literature and by inscriptions. The meaning of the scheme is equally
  certain. It was to be, as it were, a Chinese wall, marking the definite
  limit of the Roman world. It was now declared, not by the secret
  resolutions of cabinets, but by the work of the spade marking the solid
  earth for ever, that the era of conquest was ended.</p>

      alt="Roman Britain." title="Roman Britain." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>But empires move, though rulers bid them stand still. Whether the land
  beyond Hadrian's wall became temptingly peaceful or remained in vexing
  disorder, our authorities do not say. We know only that about 142
  Hadrian's successor, Antoninus Pius, acting through his general Lollius
  Urbicus, advanced from the Tyne and Solway frontier to the narrower
  isthmus between Forth and Clyde, 36 m. across, which Agricola had
  fortified before him. Here he reared a continuous rampart with a ditch in
  front of it, fair-sized forts, probably a dozen in number, built either
  close behind it or actually abutting on it, and a connecting road running
  from end to end. An ancient writer states that the rampart was built of
  regularly laid sods (the same method which had probably been employed by
  Hadrian), and excavations in 1891-1893 have verified the statement. The
  work still survives visibly, though in varying preservation, except in
  the agricultural districts near its two ends. Occasionally, as on
  Croyhill (near Kilsyth), at Westerwood, and in the covers of Bonnyside (3
  m. west of Falkirk), wall and ditch and even road can be distinctly
  traced, and the sites of many of the forts are plain to practised eyes.
  Three of these forts have been excavated. All three show the ordinary
  features of Roman <i>castella</i>, though they differ more than one would
  expect in forts built at one time by one general. Bar Hill, the most
  completely explored, covers three acres&mdash;nearly five times as much
  as the earlier fort of Agricola on the same site. It had ramparts of
  turf, barrack-rooms of wood, and a headquarters building, storehouse and
  bath in stone: it stands a few yards back from the wall. Castle Cary
  covers nearly four acres: its ramparts contain massive and well-dressed
  masonry; its interior buildings, though they agree in material, do not
  altogether agree in plan with those of Bar Hill, and its north face falls
  in line with the frontier wall. Rough Castle, near Falkirk, is very much
  smaller; it is remarkable for the astonishing strength of its turf-built
  and earthen ramparts and ravelins, and for a remarkable series of
  defensive pits, reminiscent of Caesar's <i>lilia</i> at Alesia, plainly
  intended to break an enemy's charge, and either provided with stakes to
  impale the assailant or covered over with hurdles or the like to deceive
  him. Besides the dozen forts on the wall, one or two outposts may have
  been held at Ardoch and Abernethy along the natural route which runs by
  Stirling and Perth to the lowlands of the east coast. This frontier was
  reached from the south by two roads. One, known in medieval times as Dere
  Street and misnamed Watling Street by modern antiquaries, ran from
  Corbridge on the Tyne past Otterburn, crossed Cheviot near Makendon
  Camps, and passed by an important fort at Newstead near Melrose, and
  another at Inveresk (outside of Edinburgh), to the eastern end of the
  wall. The other, starting from Carlisle, ran to Birrens, a Roman fort
  near Ecclefechan, and thence, by a line not yet explored and indeed not
  at all certain, to Carstairs and the west end of the wall. This wall was
  in addition to, and not instead of, the wall of Hadrian. Both barriers
  were held together, and the district between them was regarded as a
  military area, outside the range of civilization.</p>

  <p>The work of Pius brought no long peace. Sixteen years later disorder
  broke out in north Britain, apparently in the district between the
  Cheviots and the Derbyshire hills, and was repressed with difficulty
  after four or five years' fighting. Eighteen or twenty years later
  (180-185) a new war broke out with a different issue. The Romans lost
  everything beyond Cheviot, and perhaps even more. The government of
  Commodus, feeble in itself and vexed by many troubles, could not repair
  the loss, and the civil wars which soon raged in Europe (193-197) gave
  the Caledonians further chance. It was not till 208 that Septimius
  Severus, the ablest emperor of his age, could turn his attention to the
  island. He came thither in person, invaded Caledonia, commenced the
  reconstruction of the wall of Hadrian, rebuilding it from end to end in
  stone, and then in the fourth year of his operations died at York. Amid
  much that is uncertain and even legendary about his work in Britain, this
  is plain, that he fixed on the line of Hadrian's wall as his substantive
  frontier. His successors, Caracalla and Severus Alexander (211-235),
  accepted the position, and many inscriptions refer to building or
  rebuilding executed by them for the greater efficiency of the frontier
  defences. The conquest of Britain was at last over. The wall of Hadrian
  remained for nearly two hundred years more the northern limit of Roman
  power in the extreme west.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Province of Britain and its Military
  System.</i>&mdash;Geographically, Britain consists of two parts: (1) the
  comparatively flat lowlands of the south, east and midlands, suitable to
  agriculture and open to easy intercourse with the continent, i.e. with
  the rest of the Roman empire; (2) the district consisting of the hills of
  Devon and Cornwall, of Wales and of northern England, regions lying more,
  and often very much more, than 600 ft. above the sea, scarred with gorges
  and deep valleys, mountainous in character, difficult for armies to
  traverse, ill fitted to the peaceful pursuits in agriculture. These two
  parts of the province differ also in their history. The lowlands, as we
  have seen, were conquered easily and quickly. The uplands were hardly
  subdued completely till the end of the 2nd century. They differ, thirdly,
  in the character of their Roman occupation. The lowlands were the scene
  of civil life. Towns, villages and country houses were their prominent
  features; troops were hardly seen in them save in some fortresses on the
  edge of the hills and in a chain of forts built in the 4th century to
  defend the south-east coast, the so-called Saxon Shore. The uplands of
  Wales and the north presented another spectacle. Here civil life was
  almost wholly absent. No country town or country house has been found
  more than 20 m. north of York or west of Monmouthshire. The hills were
  one extensive military frontier, covered with forts and strategic roads
  connecting them, and devoid of town life, country houses, farms or
  peaceful civilized industry. This geographical division was not
  reproduced by Rome in any administrative partitions of the province. At
  first the whole was governed by one <i>legatus Augusti</i> of consular
  standing. <!-- Page 585 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page585"></a>[v.04 p.0585]</span>Septimius Severus made it two
  provinces, Superior and Inferior, with a boundary which probably ran from
  Humber to Mersey, but we do not know how long this arrangement lasted. In
  the 5th century there were five provinces, Britannia Prima and Secunda,
  Flavia and Maxima Caesariensis and (for a while) Valentia, ruled by
  <i>praesides</i> and <i>consulares</i> under a <i>vicartus</i>, but the
  only thing known of them is that Britannia Prima included
  Cirencester.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/britain_1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/britain_1.png"
      alt="Fig 1.--Plan of Housesteads." title="Fig 1.--Plan of Housesteads." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Plan of Housesteads (Borcovicium)
    on Hadrian's Wall.
  </div>
  <p>The army which guarded or coerced the province consisted, from the
  time of Hadrian onwards, of (1) three legions, the Second at Isca Silurum
  (Caerleon-on-Usk, <i>q.v.</i>), the Ninth at Ebur&#x101;cum (<i>q.v.</i>;
  now York), the Twentieth at Deva (<i>q.v.</i>; now Chester), a total of
  some 15,000 heavy infantry; and (2) a large but uncertain number of
  auxiliaries, troops of the second grade, organized in infantry cohorts or
  cavalry <i>alae</i>, each 500 or 1000 strong, and posted in
  <i>castella</i> nearer the frontiers than the legions. The legionary
  fortresses were large rectangular enclosures of 50 or 60 acres,
  surrounded by strong walls of which traces can still be seen in the lower
  courses of the north and east town-walls of Chester, in the abbey gardens
  at York, and on the south side of Caerleon. The auxiliary <i>castella</i>
  were hardly a tenth of the size, varying generally from three to six
  acres according to the size of the regiment and the need for stabling. Of
  these upwards of 70 are known in England and some 20 more in Scotland. Of
  the English examples a few have been carefully excavated, notably
  Gellygaer between Cardiff and Brecon, one of the most perfect specimens
  to be found anywhere in the Roman empire of a Roman fort dating from the
  end of the 1st century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>; Hardknott, on a
  Cumberland moor overhanging Upper Eskdale; and Housesteads on Hadrian's
  wall. In Scotland excavation has been more active, in particular at the
  forts of Birrens, Newstead near Melrose, Lyne near Peebles, Ardoch
  between Stirling and Perth, and Castle Cary, Rough Castle and Bar Hill on
  the wall of Pius. The internal arrangements of all these forts follow one
  general plan. But in some of them the internal buildings are all of
  stone, while in others, principally (it seems) forts built before 150,
  wood is used freely and only the few principal buildings seem to have
  been constructed throughout of stone.</p>

  <p>We may illustrate their character from Housesteads, which, in the form
  in which we know it, perhaps dates from Septimius Severus. This fort
  measures about 360 by 600 ft. and covers a trifle less than 5 acres. Its
  ramparts are of stone, and its north rampart coincides with the great
  wall of Hadrian. Its interior is filled with stone buildings. Chief among
  these (see fig. 1), and in the centre of the whole fort, is the
  Headquarters, in Lat. <i>Principia</i> or, as it is often (though perhaps
  less correctly) styled by moderns, <i>Praetorium</i>. This is a
  rectangular structure with only one entrance which gives access, first,
  to a small cloistered court (x. 4), then to a second open court (x. 7),
  and finally to a row of five rooms (x. 8-12) containing the shrine for
  official worship, the treasury and other offices. Close by were officers'
  quarters, generally built round a tiny cloistered court (ix., xi., xii.),
  and substantially built storehouses with buttresses and dry basements
  (viii.). These filled the middle third of the fort. At the two ends were
  barracks for the soldiers (i.-vi., xiii.-xviii.). No space was allotted
  to private religion or domestic life. The shrines which voluntary
  worshippers might visit, the public bath-house, and the cottages of the
  soldiers' wives, camp followers, &amp;c., lay outside the walls. Such
  were nearly all the Roman forts in Britain. They differ somewhat from
  Roman forts in Germany or other provinces, though most of the differences
  arise from the different usage of wood and of stone in various
  places.</p>

  <p>Forts of this kind were dotted all along the military roads of the
  Welsh and northern hill-districts. In Wales a road ran from Chester past
  a fort at Caer-hyn (near Conway) to a fort at Carnarvon (Segontium). A
  similar road ran along the south coast from Caerleon-on-Usk past a fort
  at Cardiff and perhaps others, to Carmarthen. A third, roughly parallel
  to the shore of Cardigan Bay, with forts at Llanio and Tommen-y-mur (near
  Festiniog), connected the northern and southern roads, while <!-- Page
  586 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page586"></a>[v.04
  p.0586]</span>the interior was held by a system of roads and forts not
  yet well understood but discernible at such points as Caer-gai on Bala
  Lake, Castle Collen near Llandrindod Wells, the Gaer near Brecon, Merthyr
  and Gellygaer. In the north of Britain we find three principal roads. One
  led due north from York past forts at Catterick Bridge, Piers Bridge,
  Binchester, Lanchester, Ebchester to the wall and to Scotland, while
  branches through Chester-le-Street reached the Tyne Bridge (Pons Aelius)
  at Newcastle and the Tyne mouth at South Shields. A second road, turning
  north-west from Catterick Bridge, mounted the Pennine Chain by way of
  forts at Rokeby, Bowes and Brough-under-Stainmoor, descended into the
  Eden valley, reached Hadrian's wall near Carlisle (Luguvallium), and
  passed on to Birrens. The third route, starting from Chester and passing
  up the western coast, is more complex, and exists in duplicate, the
  result perhaps of two different schemes of road-making. Forts in plenty
  can be detected along it, notably Manchester (Mancunium or Mamucium),
  Ribchester (Bremetennacum), Brougham Castle (Brocavum), Old Penrith
  (Voreda), and on a western branch, Watercrook near Kendal, Waterhead near
  the hotel of that name on Ambleside, Hardknott above Eskdale, Maryport
  (Uxellod&#x16B;num), and Old Carlisle (possibly Petriana). In addition,
  two or three cross roads, not yet sufficiently explored, maintained
  communication between the troops in Yorkshire and those in Cheshire and
  Lancashire. This road system bears plain marks of having been made at
  different times, and with different objectives, but we have no evidence
  that any one part was abandoned when any other was built. There are
  signs, however, that various forts were dismantled as the country grew
  quieter. Thus, Gellygaer in South Wales and Hardknott in Cumberland have

  </div>
  <p>Besides these detached forts and their connecting roads, the north of
  Britain was defended by Hadrian's wall (figs. 2 and 3). The history of
  this wall has been given above. The actual works are threefold. First,
  there is that which to-day forms the most striking feature in the whole,
  the wall of stone 6-8 ft. thick, and originally perhaps 14 ft. high, with
  a deep ditch in front, and forts and "mile castles" and turrets and a
  connecting road behind it. On the high moors between Chollerford and
  Gilsland its traces are still plain, as it climbs from hill to hill and
  winds along perilous precipices. Secondly, there is the so-called
  "Vallum," in reality no <i>vallum</i> at all, but a broad flat-bottomed
  ditch out of which the earth has been cast up on either side into regular
  and continuous mounds that resemble ramparts. Thirdly, nowhere very clear
  on the surface and as yet detected only at a few points, there are the
  remains of the "turf wall," constructed of sods laid in regular courses,
  with a ditch in front. This turf wall is certainly older than the stone
  wall, and, as our ancient writers mention two wall-builders, Hadrian and
  Septimius Severus, the natural inference is that Hadrian built his wall
  of turf and Severus reconstructed it in stone. The reconstruction
  probably followed in general the line of Hadrian's wall in order to
  utilize the existing ditch, and this explains why the turf wall itself
  survives only at special points. In general it was destroyed to make way
  for the new wall in stone. Occasionally (as at Birdoswald) there was a
  deviation, and the older work survived. This conversion of earthwork into
  stone in the age of Severus can be paralleled from other parts of the
  Roman empire.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Section of Hadrian's Wall.
  </div>
  <p>The meaning of the <i>vallum</i> is much more doubtful. John Hodgson
  and Bruce, the local authorities of the 19th century, supposed that it
  was erected to defend the wall from southern insurgents. Others have
  ascribed it to Agricola, or have thought it to be the wall of Hadrian, or
  even assigned it to pre-Roman natives. The two facts that are clear about
  it are, that it is a Roman work, no older than Hadrian (if so old), and
  that it was not intended, like the wall, for military defence. Probably
  it is contemporaneous with either the turf wall or the stone wall, and
  marked some limit of the civil province of Britain. Beyond this we cannot
  at present go.</p>

  <p>III. <i>The Civilization of Roman Britain.</i>&mdash;Behind these
  formidable garrisons, sheltered from barbarians and in easy contact with
  the Roman empire, stretched the lowlands of southern and eastern Britain.
  Here a civilized life grew up, and Roman culture spread. This part of
  Britain became Romanized. In the lands looking on to the Thames estuary
  (Kent, Essex, Middlesex) the process had perhaps begun before the Roman
  conquest. It was continued after that event, and in two ways. To some
  extent it was definitely encouraged by the Roman government, which here,
  as elsewhere, founded towns peopled with Roman citizens&mdash;generally
  discharged legionaries&mdash;and endowed them with franchise and
  constitution like those of the Italian municipalities. It developed still
  more by its own automatic growth. The coherent civilization of the Romans
  was accepted by the Britons, as it was by the Gauls, with something like
  enthusiasm. Encouraged perhaps by sympathetic Romans, spurred on still
  more by their own instincts, and led no doubt by their nobles, they began
  to speak Latin, to use the material resources of Roman civilized life,
  and in time to consider themselves not the unwilling subjects of a
  foreign empire, but the British members of the Roman state. The steps by
  which these results were reached can to some extent be dated. Within a
  few years of the Claudian invasion a <i>colonia</i>, or municipality of
  time-expired soldiers, had been planted in the old native capital of
  Colchester (Camulod&#x16B;num), and though it served at first mainly as a
  fortress and thus provoked British hatred, it came soon to exercise a
  civilizing influence. At the same time the British town of Verulamium (St
  Albans) was thought sufficiently Romanized to deserve the municipal
  status of a <i>municipium</i>, which at this period differed little from
  that of a <i>colonia</i>. Romanized Britons must now have begun to be
  numerous. In the great revolt of Boadicea (60) the nationalist party seem
  to have massacred many thousands of them along with actual Romans.
  Fifteen or twenty years later, the movement increases. Towns spring up,
  such as Silchester, laid out in Roman fashion, furnished with public
  buildings of Roman type, and filled with houses which are Roman in
  fittings if not in plan. The baths of Bath (Aquae Sulis) are exploited.
  Another <i>colonia</i> is planted at Lincoln (Lindum), and a third at
  Gloucester (Glevum) in 96. A new "chief judge" is appointed for
  increasing civil business. The tax-gatherer and recruiting officer begin
  to make their way into the hills. During the 2nd century progress was
  perhaps slower, hindered doubtless by the repeated risings in the north.
  It was not till the 3rd century that country houses and farms became
  common in most parts of the civilized area. In the beginning of the <!--
  Page 587 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page587"></a>[v.04
  p.0587]</span>4th century the skilled artisans and builders, and the
  cloth and corn of Britain were equally famous on the continent. This
  probably was the age when the prosperity and Romanization of the province
  reached its height. By this time the town populations and the educated
  among the country-folk spoke Latin, and Britain regarded itself as a
  Roman land, inhabited by Romans and distinct from outer barbarians.</p>

  <p>The civilization which had thus spread over half the island was
  genuinely Roman, identical in kind with that of the other western
  provinces of the empire, and in particular with that of northern Gaul.
  But it was defective in quantity. The elements which compose it are
  marked by smaller size, less wealth and less splendour than the same
  elements elsewhere. It was also uneven in its distribution. Large tracts,
  in particular Warwickshire and the adjoining midlands, were very thinly
  inhabited. Even densely peopled areas like north Kent, the Sussex coast,
  west Gloucestershire and east Somerset, immediately adjoin areas like the
  Weald of Kent and Sussex where Romano-British remains hardly occur.</p>

  <p>The administration of the civilized part of the province, while
  subject to the governor of all Britain, was practically entrusted to
  local authorities. Each Roman municipality ruled itself and a territory
  perhaps as large as a small county which belonged to it. Some districts
  belonged to the Imperial Domains, and were administered by agents of the
  emperor. The rest, by far the larger part of the country, was divided up
  among the old native tribes or cantons, some ten or twelve in number,
  each grouped round some country town where its council (<i>ordo</i>) met
  for cantonal business. This cantonal system closely resembles that which
  we find in Gaul. It is an old native element recast in Roman form, and
  well illustrates the Roman principle of local government by
  devolution.</p>

  <p>In the general framework of Romano-British life the two chief features
  were the town, and the <i>villa</i>. The towns of the province, as we
  have already implied, fall into two classes. Five modern cities,
  Colchester, Lincoln, York, Gloucester and St Albans, stand on the sites,
  and in some fragmentary fashion bear the names of five Roman
  municipalities, founded by the Roman government with special charters and
  constitutions. All of these reached a considerable measure of prosperity.
  None of them rivals the greater municipalities of other provinces.
  Besides them we trace a larger number of country towns, varying much in
  size, but all possessing in some degree the characteristics of a town.
  The chief of these seem to be cantonal capitals, probably developed out
  of the market centres or capitals of the Celtic tribes before the Roman
  conquest. Such are Isurium Brigantum, capital of the Brigantes, 12 m.
  north-west of York and the most northerly Romano-British town; Ratae, now
  Leicester, capital of the Coritani; Viroconium, now Wroxeter, near
  Shrewsbury, capital of the Cornovii; Venta Silurum, now Caerwent, near
  Chepstow; Corinium, now Cirencester, capital of the Dobuni; Isca
  Dumnoniorum, now Exeter, the most westerly of these towns; Durnovaria,
  now Dorchester, in Dorset, capital of the Durotriges; Venta Belgarum, now
  Winchester; Calleva Atrebatum, now Silchester, 10 m. south of Reading;
  Durovernum Cantiacorum, now Canterbury; and Venta Icenorum, now
  Caistor-by-Norwich. Besides these country towns, Londinium (London) was a
  rich and important trading town, centre of the road system, and the seat
  of the finance officials of the province, as the remarkable objects
  discovered in it abundantly prove, while Aquae Sulis (Bath) was a spa
  provided with splendid baths, and a richly adorned temple of the native
  patron deity, Sul or Sulis, whom the Romans called Minerva. Many smaller
  places, too, for example, Magna or Kenchester near Hereford, Durobrivae
  or Rochester in Kent, another Durobrivae near Peterborough, a site of
  uncertain name near Cambridge, another of uncertain name near
  Chesterford, exhibited some measure of town life.</p>

  <p>As a specimen we may take Silchester, remarkable as the one town in
  the whole Roman empire which has been completely and systematically
  uncovered. As we see it to-day, it is an open space of 100 acres, set on
  a hill with a wide prospect east and south and west, in shape an
  irregular hexagon, enclosed in a circuit of a mile and a half by the
  massive ruins of a city wall which still stands here and there some 20
  ft. high (fig. 4). Outside, on the north-east, is the grassy hollow of a
  tiny amphitheatre; on the west a line of earthworks runs in wider circuit
  than the walls. The area within the walls is a vast expanse of cultivated
  land, unbroken by any vestige of antiquity; yet the soil is thick with
  tile and potsherd, and in hot summers the unevenly growing corn reveals
  the remains of streets beneath the surface. Casual excavations were made
  here in 1744 and 1833; more systematic ones intermittently between 1864
  and 1884 by the Rev. J.G. Joyce and others; finally, in May 1890, the
  complete uncovering of the whole site was begun by Mr G.E. Fox and
  others. The work was carried on with splendid perseverance, and the
  uncovering of the interior was completed in 1908.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;General Plan of Silchester
    (Calleva Atrebatum).
  </div>
  <p>The chief results concern the buildings. Though these have vanished
  wholly from the surface, the foundations and lowest courses of their
  walls survive fairly perfect below ground: thus the plan of the town can
  be minutely recovered, and both the character of the buildings which make
  up a place like Calleva, and the character of Romano-British buildings
  generally, become plainer. Of the buildings the chief are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Forum.</i>&mdash;Near the middle of the town was a rectangular
  block covering two acres. It comprised a central open court, 132 ft. by
  140 ft. in size, surrounded on three sides by a corridor or cloister,
  with rooms opening on the cloister (fig. 5). On the fourth side was a
  great hall, with rooms opening into it from behind. This hall was 270 ft.
  long and 58 ft. wide; two rows of Corinthian columns ran down the middle,
  and the clerestory roof may have stood 50 ft. above the floor; the walls
  were frescoed or lined with marble, and for ornament there were probably
  statues. Finally, a corridor ran round outside the whole block. Here the
  local authorities had their offices, justice was administered, traders
  trafficked, citizens and idlers gathered. Though we cannot apportion the
  rooms to their precise uses, the great hall was plainly the basilica, for
  meetings and business; the rooms behind it were perhaps law courts, and
  some of the rooms on the other three sides of the quadrangle may have
  been shops. Similar municipal buildings existed in most towns of the
  western Empire, whether they were full municipalities or (as probably
  Calleva was) of lower rank. The Callevan Forum seems in general simpler
  than others, but its basilica is remarkably large. Probably the British
  climate compelled more indoor life than the sunnier south.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Temples.</i>&mdash;Two small square temples, of a common
  western-provincial type, were in the east of the town; the <i>cella</i>
  of the larger measured 42 ft. sq., and was lined with Purbeck marble. A
  third, circular temple stood between the forum and the south gate. A
  fourth, a smaller square shrine found in 1907 a little east of the <!--
  Page 588 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page588"></a>[v.04
  p.0588]</span>forum, yielded some interesting inscriptions which relate
  to a gild (<i>collegium</i>) and incidentally confirm the name
  Calleva.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Plan of Forum, Basilica and
    surroundings, Silchester.
  </div>
  <p>3. <i>Christian Church.</i>&mdash;Close outside the south-east angle
  of the forum was a small edifice, 42 ft. by 27 ft., consisting of a nave
  and two aisles which ended at the east in a porch as wide as the
  building, and at the west in an apse and two flanking chambers. The nave
  and porch were floored with plain red tesserae: in the apse was a simple
  mosaic panel in red, black and white. Round the building was a yard,
  fenced with wooden palings; in it were a well near the apse, and a small
  structure of tile with a pit near the east end. No direct proof of date
  or use was discovered. But the ground plan is that of an early Christian
  church of the "basilican" type. This type comprised nave and aisles,
  ending at one end in an apse and two chambers resembling rudimentary
  transepts, and at the other end in a porch (<i>narthex</i>). Previous to
  about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 420 the porch was often at the east
  end and the apse at the west, and the altar, often movable, stood in the
  apse&mdash;as at Silchester, perhaps, on the mosaic panel. A court
  enclosed the whole; near the porch was a laver for the ablutions of
  intending worshippers. Many such churches have been found in other
  countries, especially in Roman Africa; no other satisfactory instance is
  known in Britain.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Town Baths.</i>&mdash;A suite of public baths stood a little
  east of the forum. At the entrance were a peristyle court for loungers
  and a latrine: hence the bather passed into the Apodyterium
  (dressing-room), the Frigidarium (cold room) fitted with a cold bath for
  use at the end of the bathing ceremony, and a series of hot
  rooms&mdash;the whole resembling many modern Turkish baths. In their
  first form the baths of Silchester were about 160 ft. by 80 ft., but they
  were later considerably extended.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Private Houses.</i>&mdash;The private houses of Silchester are
  of two types. They consist either of a row of rooms, with a corridor
  along them, and perhaps one or two additional rooms at one or both ends,
  or of three such corridors and rows of rooms, forming three sides of a
  large square open yard. They are detached houses, standing each in its
  own garden, and not forming terraces or rows. The country houses of Roman
  Britain have long been recognized as embodying these (or allied) types;
  now it becomes plain that they were the normal types throughout Britain.
  They differ widely from the town houses of Rome and Pompeii: they are
  less unlike some of the country houses of Italy and Roman Africa; but
  their real parallels occur in Gaul, and they may be Celtic types modified
  to Roman use&mdash;like Indian bungalows. Their internal
  fittings&mdash;hypocausts, frescoes, mosaics&mdash;are everywhere Roman;
  those at Silchester are average specimens, and, except for one mosaic,
  not individually striking. The largest Silchester house, with a special
  annexe for baths, is usually taken to be a guest-house or inn for
  travellers between London and the west (fig. 6). Altogether, the town
  probably did not contain more than seventy or eighty houses of any size,
  and large spaces were not built over at all. This fact and the peculiar
  character of the houses must have given to Silchester rather the
  appearance of a village with scattered cottages, each in its own plot
  facing its own way, than a town with regular and continuous streets.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Industries.</i>&mdash;Shops are conjectured in the forum and
  elsewhere, but were not numerous. Many dyers' furnaces, a little silver
  refinery, and perhaps a bakery have also been noticed.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;Plan of supposed Inn and Baths at
    Silchester.
  </div>
  <p>7. <i>Streets, Roads, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The streets were paved with
  gravel: they varied in width up to 28½ ft. They intersect regularly at
  right angles, dividing the town into square blocks, like modern Mannheim
  or Turin, according to a Roman system usual in both Italy and the
  provinces: plainly they were laid out all at once, possibly by Agricola
  (Tac. <i>Agr.</i> 21) and most probably about his time. There were four
  chief gates, not quite symmetrically placed. The town-walls are built of
  flint and concrete bonded with ironstone, and are backed with earth. In
  the plans, though not in the reports, of the excavations, they are shown
  as built later than the streets. No traces of meat-market, theatre or
  aqueduct have come to light: water was got from wells lined with wooden
  tubs, and must have been scanty in dry summers. Smaller objects
  abound&mdash;coins, pottery, window and bottle and cup glass, bronze
  ornaments, iron tools, &amp;c.&mdash;and many belong to the beginnings of
  Calleva, but few pieces are individually notable. Traces of late Celtic
  art are singularly absent; Roman fashions rule supreme, and inscriptions
  show that even the lower classes here spoke and wrote Latin. Outside the
  walls were the cemeteries, not yet explored. Of suburbs we have as yet no
  hint. Nor indeed is the neighbourhood of Calleva at all rich in Roman
  remains. In fact, as well as in Celtic etymology, it was "the town in the
  forest." A similar absence of remains may be noticed outside other
  Romano-British towns, and is significant of their economic position. Such
  doubtless were most of the towns of Roman Britain&mdash;thoroughly
  Romanized, peopled with Roman-speaking citizens, furnished with Roman
  appurtenances, living in Roman ways, but not very large, not very rich, a
  humble witness to the assimilating power of the Roman civilization in
  Britain.</p>

  <p>The country, as opposed to the towns, of Roman Britain seems to have
  been divided into estates, commonly (though perhaps incorrectly) known as
  "villas." Many examples survive, some of them large and luxurious
  country-houses, some mere farms, constructed usually on one of the two
  patterns described in the account of Silchester above. The inhabitants
  were plainly as various&mdash;a few of them great nobles and wealthy
  landowners, others small farmers or possibly bailiffs. Some of these
  estates were worked on the true "villa" system, by which the lord
  occupied the "great house," and cultivated the land close round it by
  slaves, while he let the rest to half-free <i>coloni</i>. But other
  systems may have prevailed as well. Among the most important
  country-houses are those of Bignor in west Sussex, and Woodchester and
  Chedworth in Gloucestershire.</p>

  <p>The wealth of the country was principally agrarian. Wheat and wool
  were exported in the 4th century, when, as we have said, Britain was
  especially prosperous. But the details of the trade are unrecorded. More
  is known of the lead and iron mines which, at least in the first two
  centuries, were worked in many districts&mdash;lead in Somerset,
  Shropshire, Flintshire and Derbyshire; iron in the west Sussex Weald, the
  Forest of Dean, and (to a slight extent) elsewhere. Other minerals were
  less notable. The gold mentioned by Tacitus proved scanty. The Cornish
  tin, according to present evidence, was worked comparatively little, and
  perhaps most in the later Empire.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the roads. Here we must put aside all idea of "Four Great
  Roads." That category is probably the invention of <!-- Page 589 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page589"></a>[v.04 p.0589]</span>antiquaries,
  and certainly unconnected with Roman Britain (see <span class="sc">Ermine
  Street</span>). Instead, we may distinguish four main groups of roads
  radiating from London, and a fifth which runs obliquely. One road ran
  south-east to Canterbury and the Kentish ports, of which Richborough
  (Rutupiae) was the most frequented. A second ran west to Silchester, and
  thence by various branches to Winchester, Exeter, Bath, Gloucester and
  South Wales. A third, known afterwards to the English as Watling Street,
  ran by St Albans Wall near Lichfield (Letocetum), to Wroxeter and
  Chester. It also gave access by a branch to Leicester and Lincoln. A
  fourth served Colchester, the eastern counties, Lincoln and York. The
  fifth is that known to the English as the Fosse, which joins Lincoln and
  Leicester with Cirencester, Bath and Exeter. Besides these five groups,
  an obscure road, called by the Saxons Akeman Street, gave alternative
  access from London through Alchester (outside of Bicester) to Bath, while
  another obscure road winds south from near Sheffield, past Derby and
  Birmingham, and connects the lower Severn with the Humber. By these roads
  and their various branches the Romans provided adequate communications
  throughout the lowlands of Britain.</p>

  <p>IV. <i>The End of Roman Britain.</i>&mdash;Early in the 4th century it
  was necessary to establish a special coast defence, reaching from the
  Wash to Spithead, against Saxon pirates: there were forts at Brancaster,
  Borough Castle (near Yarmouth), Bradwell (at the mouth of the Colne and
  Blackwater), Reculver, Richborough, Dover and Lymme (all in Kent),
  Pevensey in Sussex, Porchester near Portsmouth, and perhaps also at
  Felixstowe in Suffolk. After about 350, barbarian assaults, not only of
  Saxons but also of Irish (Scoti) and Picts, became commoner and more
  terrible. At the end of the century Magnus Maximus, claiming to be
  emperor, withdrew many troops from Britain and a later pretender did the
  same. Early in the 5th century the Teutonic conquest of Gaul cut the
  island off from Rome. This does not mean that there was any great
  "departure of Romans." The central government simply ceased to send the
  usual governors and high officers. The Romano-British were left to
  themselves. Their position was weak. Their fortresses lay in the north
  and west, while the Saxons attacked the east and south. Their trained
  troops, and even their own numbers, must have been few. It is
  intelligible that they followed a precedent set by Rome in that age, and
  hired Saxons to repel Saxons. But they could not command the fidelity of
  their mercenaries, and the Saxon peril only grew greater. It would seem
  as if the Romano-Britons were speedily driven from the east of the
  island. Even Wroxeter on the Welsh border may have been finally destroyed
  before the end of the 5th century. It seems that the Saxons though
  apparently unable to maintain their hold so far to the west, were able to
  prevent the natives from recovering the lowlands. Thus driven from the
  centres of Romanized life, from the region of walled cities and civilized
  houses, into the hills of Wales and the north-west, the provincials
  underwent an intelligible change. The Celtic element, never quite extinct
  in those hills and, like most forms of barbarism, reasserting itself in
  this wild age&mdash;not without reinforcement from
  Ireland&mdash;challenged the remnants of Roman civilization and in the
  end absorbed them. The Celtic language reappeared; the Celtic art emerged
  from its shelters in the west to develop in new and medieval
  fashions.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The principal references to
  early Britain in classical writers occur in Strabo, Diodorus, Julius
  Caesar, the elder Pliny, Tacitus, Ptolemy and Cassius Dio, and in the
  lists of the Antonine Itinerary (probably about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 210-230; ed. Parthey, 1848), the <i>Notitia
  Dignitatum</i> (about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 400; ed. Seeck,
  1876), and the Ravennas (7th-century <i>rechauffé</i>; ed. Parthey 1860).
  The chief passages are collected in Petrie's <i>Monumenta Hist.
  Britann.</i> (1848), and (alphabetically) in Holder's <i>Altkeltische

<h4><span class="sc">Anglo-Saxon Britain</span></h4>

  <p>1. <i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of Britain after the withdrawal
  of the Roman troops is extremely obscure, but there can be little doubt
  that for many years the inhabitants of the provinces were exposed to
  devastating raids by the Picts and Scots. According to Gildas it was for
  protection against these incursions that the Britons decided to call in
  the Saxons. Their allies soon obtained a decisive victory; but
  subsequently they turned their arms against the Britons themselves,
  alleging that they had not received sufficient payment for their
  services. A somewhat different account, probably of English origin, may
  be traced in the <i>Historia Brittonum</i>, according to which the first
  leaders of the Saxons, Hengest and Horsa, came as exiles, seeking the
  protection of the British king, Vortigern. Having embraced his service
  they quickly succeeded in expelling the northern invaders. Eventually,
  however, they overcame the Britons through treachery, by inducing the
  king to allow them to send for large bodies of their own countrymen. It
  was to these adventurers, according to tradition, that the kingdom of
  Kent owed its origin. The story is in itself by no means improbable,
  while the dates assigned to the first invasion by various Welsh, Gaulish
  and English authorities, with one exception all fall within about a
  quarter of a century, viz. between the year 428 and the joint reign of
  Martian and Valentinian III. (450-455).</p>

  <p>For the subsequent course of the invasion our information is of the
  most meagre and unsatisfactory character. According to the Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle the kingdom of Sussex was founded by a certain Ella or Ælle,
  who landed in 477, while Wessex owed its origin to Cerdic, who arrived
  some eighteen years later. No value, however, can be attached to these
  dates; indeed, in the latter case the story itself is open to suspicion
  on several grounds (see <span class="sc">Wessex</span>). For the
  movements which led to the foundation of the more northern kingdoms we
  have no evidence worth consideration, nor do we know even approximately
  when they took place. But the view that the invasion was effected
  throughout by small bodies of adventurers acting independently of one
  another, and that each of the various kingdoms owes its origin to a
  separate enterprise, has little probability in its favour. Bede states
  that the invaders belonged to three different nations, Kent and southern
  Hampshire being occupied by Jutes (<i>q.v.</i>), while Essex, Sussex and
  Wessex were founded by the Saxons, and the remaining kingdoms by the
  Angli (<i>q.v.</i>). The peculiarities of social organization in Kent
  certainly tend to show that this kingdom had a different origin from the
  rest; but the evidence for the distinction between the Saxons and the
  Angli is of a much less satisfactory character (see <span
  class="sc">Anglo-Saxons</span>). <!-- Page 590 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page590"></a>[v.04 p.0590]</span>The royal
  family of Essex may really have been of Saxon origin (see <span
  class="sc">Essex</span>), but on the other hand the West Saxon royal
  family claimed to be of the same stock as that of Bernicia, and their
  connexions in the past seem to have lain with the Angli.</p>

  <p>We need not doubt that the first invasion was followed by a long
  period of warfare between the natives and the invaders, in which the
  latter gradually strengthened their hold on the conquered territories. It
  is very probable that by the end of the 5th century all the eastern part
  of Britain, at least as far as the Humber, was in their hands. The first
  important check was received at the siege of "Mons Badonicus" in the year
  517 (<i>Ann. Cambr.</i>), or perhaps rather some fifteen or twenty years
  earlier. According to Gildas this event was followed by a period of peace
  for at least forty-four years. In the latter part of the 6th century,
  however, the territories occupied by the invaders seem to have been
  greatly extended. In the south the West Saxons are said to have conquered
  first Wiltshire and then all the upper part of the Thames valley,
  together with the country beyond as far as the Severn. The northern
  frontier also seems to have been pushed considerably farther forward,
  perhaps into what is now Scotland, and it is very probable that the basin
  of the Trent, together with the central districts between the Trent and
  the Thames, was conquered about the same time, though of this we have no
  record. Again, the destruction of Chester about 615 was soon followed by
  the overthrow of the British kingdom of Elmet in south-west Yorkshire,
  and the occupation of Shropshire and the Lothians took place perhaps
  about the same period, that of Herefordshire probably somewhat later. In
  the south, Somerset is said to have been conquered by the West Saxons
  shortly after the middle of the 7th century. Dorset had probably been
  acquired by them before this time, while part of Devon seems to have come
  into their hands soon afterwards.</p>

  <p>The area thus conquered was occupied by a number of separate kingdoms,
  each with a royal family of its own. The districts north of the Humber
  contained two kingdoms, Bernicia (<i>q.v.</i>) and Deira (<i>q.v.</i>),
  which were eventually united in Northumbria. South of the Humber, Lindsey
  seems to have had a dynasty of its own, though in historical times it was
  apparently always subject to the kings of Northumbria or Mercia. The
  upper basin of the Trent formed the nucleus of the kingdom of Mercia
  (<i>q.v.</i>), while farther down the east coast was the kingdom of East
  Anglia (<i>q.v.</i>). Between these two lay a territory called Middle
  Anglia, which is sometimes described as a kingdom, though we do not know
  whether it ever had a separate dynasty. Essex, Kent and Sussex (see
  articles on these kingdoms) preserve the names of ancient kingdoms, while
  the old diocese of Worcester grew out of the kingdom of the Hwicce
  (<i>q.v.</i>), with which it probably coincided in area. The south of
  England, between Sussex and "West Wales" (eventually reduced to
  Cornwall), was occupied by Wessex, which originally also possessed some
  territory to the north of the Thames. Lastly, even the Isle of Wight
  appears to have had a dynasty of its own. But it must not be supposed
  that all these kingdoms were always, or even normally, independent. When
  history begins, Æthelberht, king of Kent, was supreme over all the kings
  south of the Humber. He was followed by the East Anglian king Raedwald,
  and the latter again by a series of Northumbrian kings with an even wider
  supremacy. Before Æthelberht a similar position had been held by the West
  Saxon king Ceawlin, and at a much earlier period, according to tradition,
  by Ella or Ælle, the first king of Sussex. The nature of this supremacy
  has been much discussed, but the true explanation seems to be furnished
  by that principle of personal allegiance which formed such an important
  element in Anglo-Saxon society.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Government.</i>&mdash;Internally the various states seem to have
  been organized on very similar lines. In every case we find kingly
  government from the time of our earliest records, and there is no doubt
  that the institution goes back to a date anterior to the invasion of
  Britain (see <span class="sc">Offa</span>; <span
  class="sc">Wermund</span>). The royal title, however, was frequently
  borne by more than one person. Sometimes we find one supreme king
  together with a number of under-kings (<i>subreguli</i>); sometimes
  again, especially in the smaller kingdoms, Essex, Sussex and Hwicce, we
  meet with two or more kings, generally brothers, reigning together
  apparently on equal terms. During the greater part of the 8th century
  Kent seems to have been divided into two kingdoms; but as a rule such
  divisions did not last beyond the lifetime of the kings between whom the
  arrangement had been made. The kings were, with very rare exceptions,
  chosen from one particular family in each state, the ancestry of which
  was traced back not only to the founder of the kingdom but also, in a
  remoter degree, to a god. The members of such families were entitled to
  special wergilds, apparently six times as great as those of the higher
  class of nobles (see below).</p>

  <p>The only other central authority in the state was the king's council
  or court (<i>þeod</i>, <i>witan</i>, <i>plebs</i>, <i>concilium</i>).
  This body consisted partly of young warriors in constant attendance on
  the king, and partly of senior officials whom he called together from
  time to time. The terms used for the two classes by Bede are
  <i>milites</i> (<i>ministri</i>) and <i>comites</i>, for which the
  Anglo-Saxon version has <i>þegnas</i> and <i>gesiðas</i> respectively.
  Both classes alike consisted in part of members of the royal family. But
  they were by no means confined to such persons or even to born subjects
  of the king. Indeed, we are told that popular kings like Oswine attracted
  young nobles to their service from all quarters. The functions of the
  council have been much discussed, and it has been claimed that they had
  the right of electing and deposing kings. This view, however, seems to
  involve the existence of a greater feeling for constitutionalism than is
  warranted by the information at our disposal. The incidents which have
  been brought forward as evidence to this effect may with at least equal
  probability be interpreted as cases of profession or transference of
  personal allegiance. In other respects the functions of the council seem
  to have been of a deliberative character. It was certainly customary for
  the king to seek their advice and moral support on important questions,
  but there is nothing to show that he had to abide by the opinion of the
  majority.</p>

  <p>For administrative purposes each of the various kingdoms was divided
  into a number of districts under the charge of royal reeves (<i>cyninges
  gerefa</i>, <i>praefectus</i>, <i>praepositus</i>). These officials seem
  to have been located in royal villages (<i>cyninges tun</i>, <i>villa
  regalis</i>) or fortresses (<i>cyninges burg</i>, <i>urbs regis</i>),
  which served as centres and meeting-places (markets, &amp;c.) for the
  inhabitants of the district, and to which their dues, both in payments
  and services had to be rendered. The usual size of such districts in
  early times seems to have been 300, 600 or 1200 hides.<a
  name="FnAnchor_091" href="#Footnote_091"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In addition
  to these districts we find mention also of much larger divisions
  containing 2000, 3000, 5000 or 7000 hides. To this category belong the
  shires of Wessex (Hampshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire, &amp;c.), each of
  which had an earl (<i>aldormon</i>, <i>princeps</i>, <i>dux</i>) of its
  own, at all events from the 8th century onwards. Many, if not all, of
  these persons were members of the royal family, and it is not unlikely
  that they originally bore the kingly title. At all events they are
  sometimes described as <i>subreguli</i>.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Social Organization.</i>&mdash;The officials mentioned above,
  whether of royal birth or not, were probably drawn from the king's
  personal retinue. In Anglo-Saxon society, as in that of all Teutonic
  nations in early times, the two most important principles were those of
  kinship and personal allegiance. If a man suffered injury it was to his
  relatives and his lord, rather than to any public official, that he
  applied first for protection and redress. If he was slain, a fixed sum
  (<i>wergild</i>), varying according to his station, had to be paid to his
  relatives, while a further but smaller sum (<i>manbot</i>) was due to his
  lord. These principles applied to all classes of society alike, and
  though strife within the family was by no means unknown, at all events in
  royal families, the actual slaying of a kinsman was regarded as the most
  heinous of all offences. Much the same feeling applied to the slaying of
  a lord&mdash;an offence for which no compensation could be rendered. How
  far the armed followers of a lord were entitled to compensation when the
  latter was slain <!-- Page 591 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page591"></a>[v.04 p.0591]</span>is uncertain, but in the case of a
  king they received an amount equal to the wergild. Another important
  development of the principle of allegiance is to be found in the custom
  of heriots. In later times this custom amounted practically to a system
  of death-duties, payable in horses and arms or in money to the lord of
  the deceased. There can be little doubt, however, that originally it was
  a restoration to the lord of the military outfit with which he had
  presented his man when he entered his service. The institution of
  thegnhood, <i>i.e.</i> membership of the <i>comitatus</i> or retinue of a
  prince, offered the only opening by which public life could be entered.
  Hence it was probably adopted almost universally by young men of the
  highest classes. The thegn was expected to fight for his lord, and
  generally to place his services at his disposal in both war and peace.
  The lord, on the other hand, had to keep his thegns and reward them from
  time to time with arms and treasure. When they were of an age to marry he
  was expected to provide them with the means of doing so. If the lord was
  a king this provision took the form of a grant, perhaps normally ten
  hides, from the royal lands. Such estates were not strictly hereditary,
  though as a mark of favour they were not unfrequently re-granted to the
  sons of deceased holders.</p>

  <p>The structure of society in England was of a somewhat peculiar type.
  In addition to slaves, who in early times seem to have been numerous, we
  find in Wessex and apparently also in Mercia three classes, described as
  <i>twelfhynde</i>, <i>sixhynde</i> and <i>twihynde</i> from the amount of
  their wergilds, viz. 1200, 600 and 200 shillings respectively. It is
  probable that similar classes existed also in Northumbria, though not
  under the same names. Besides these terms there were others which were
  probably in use everywhere, viz. <i>gesiðcund</i> for the two higher
  classes and <i>ceorlisc</i> for the lowest. Indeed, we find these terms
  even in Kent, though the social system of that kingdom seems to have been
  of an essentially different character. Here the wergild of the
  <i>ceorlisc</i> class amounted to 100 shillings, each containing twenty
  silver coins (<i>sceattas</i>), as against 200 shillings of four (in
  Wessex five) silver coins, and was thus very much greater than the
  latter. Again, there was apparently but one <i>gestiðcund</i> class in
  Kent, with a wergild of 300 shillings, while, on the other hand, below
  the <i>ceorlisc</i> class we find three classes of persons described as
  <i>laetas</i>, who corresponded in all probability to the <i>liti</i> or
  freedmen of the continental laws, and who possessed wergilds of 80, 60
  and 40 shillings respectively. To these we find nothing analogous in the
  other kingdoms, though the poorer classes of Welsh freemen had wergilds
  varying from 120 to 60 shillings. It should be added that the
  differential treatment of the various classes was by no means confined to
  the case of wergilds. We find it also in the compensations to which they
  were entitled for various injuries, in the fines to which they were
  liable, and in the value attached to their oaths. Generally, though not
  always, the proportions observed were the same as in the wergilds.</p>

  <p>The nature of the distinction between the <i>gesiðcund</i> and
  <i>ceorlisc</i> classes is nowhere clearly explained; but it was
  certainly hereditary and probably of considerable antiquity. In general
  we may perhaps define them as nobles and commons, though in view of the
  numbers of the higher classes it would probably be more correct to speak
  of gentry and peasants. The distinction between the <i>twelfhynde</i> and
  <i>sixhynde</i> classes was also in part at least hereditary, but there
  is good reason for believing that it arose out of the possession of land.
  The former consisted of persons who possessed, whether as individuals or
  families, at least five hides of land&mdash;which practically means a
  village&mdash;while the latter were landless, <i>i.e.</i> probably
  without this amount of land. Within the <i>ceorlisc</i> class we find
  similar subdivisions, though they were not marked by a difference in
  wergild. The <i>gafolgelda</i> or <i>tributarius</i> (tribute-payer)
  seems to have been a ceorl who possessed at least a hide, while the
  <i>gebur</i> was without land of his own, and received his outfit as a
  loan from his lord.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Payments and Services.</i>&mdash;We have already had occasion to
  refer to the dues which were rendered by different classes of the
  population, and which the reeves in royal villages had to collect and
  superintend. The payments seem to have varied greatly according to the
  class from which they were due. Those rendered by landowners seem to have
  been known as <i>feorm</i> or <i>fostor</i>, and consisted of a fixed
  quantity of articles paid in kind. In Ine's Laws (cap. 70) we find a list
  of payments specified for a unit of ten hides, perhaps the normal holding
  of a <i>twelfhynde</i> man&mdash;though on the other hand it may be
  nothing more than a mere fiscal unit in an aggregate of estates. The list
  consists of oxen, sheep, geese, hens, honey, ale, loaves, cheese, butter,
  fodder, salmon and eels. Very similar specifications are found elsewhere.
  The payments rendered by the <i>gafolgelda</i> (<i>tributarius</i>) were
  known as <i>gafol</i> (<i>tributuni</i>), as his name implies. In Ine's
  Laws we hear only of the <i>hwitel</i> or white cloak, which was to be of
  the value of six pence per household (hide), and of barley, which was to
  be six pounds in weight for each worker. In later times we meet with many
  other payments both in money and in kind, some of which were doubtless in
  accordance with ancient custom. On the other hand the <i>gebur</i> seems
  not to have been liable to payments of this kind, presumably because the
  land which he cultivated formed part of the demesne (<i>inland</i>) of
  his lord. The term <i>gafol</i>, however, may have been applied to the
  payments which he rendered to the latter.</p>

  <p>The services required of landowners were very manifold in character.
  Probably the most important were military service (<i>fird</i>,
  <i>expeditio</i>) and the repairing of fortifications and
  bridges&mdash;the <i>trinoda necessitas</i> of later times. Besides these
  we find reference in charters of the 9th century to the keeping of the
  king's hunters, horses, dogs and hawks, and the entertaining of
  messengers and other persons in the king's service. The duties of men of
  the <i>sixhynde</i> class, if they are to be identified with the
  <i>radcnihtas</i> (<i>radmanni</i>) of later times, probably consisted
  chiefly in riding on the king's (or their lord's) business. The services
  of the peasantry can only be conjectured from what we find in later
  times. Presumably their chief duty was to undertake a share in the
  cultivation of the demesne land. We need scarcely doubt also that the
  labour of repairing fortifications and bridges, though it is charged
  against the landowners, was in reality delegated by them to their
  dependents.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Warfare.</i>&mdash;All classes are said to have been liable to
  the duty of military service. Hence, since the ceorls doubtless formed
  the bulk of the population, it has been thought that the Anglo-Saxon
  armies of early times were essentially peasant forces. The evidence at
  our disposal, however, gives little justification for such a view. The
  regulation that every five or six hides should supply a warrior was not a
  product of the Danish invasions, as is sometimes stated, but goes back at
  least to the beginning of the 9th century. Had the fighting material been
  drawn from the <i>ceorlisc</i> class a warrior would surely have been
  required from each hide, but for military service no such regulation is
  found. Again, the fird (<i>fyrd</i>) was composed of mounted warriors
  during the 9th century, though apparently they fought on foot, and there
  are indications that such was the case also in the 7th century. No doubt
  ceorls took part in military expeditions, but they may have gone as
  attendants and camp-followers rather than as warriors, their chief
  business being to make stockades and bridges, and especially to carry
  provisions. The serious fighting, however, was probably left to the
  <i>gesiðcund</i> classes, who possessed horses and more or less effective
  weapons. Indeed, there is good reason for regarding these classes as
  essentially military.</p>

  <p>The chief weapons were the sword and spear. The former were two-edged
  and on the average about 3 ft. long. The hilts were often elaborately
  ornamented and sometimes these weapons were of considerable value. No
  definite line can be drawn between the spear proper and the javelin. The
  spear-heads which have been found in graves vary considerably in both
  form and size. They were fitted on to the shaft, by a socket which was
  open on one side. Other weapons appear to have been quite rare. Bows and
  arrows were certainly in use for sporting purposes, but there is no
  reason for believing that they were much used in warfare before the
  Danish invasions. They are very seldom met with in graves. The most
  common article of defensive armour was the shield, which was small and
  circular and apparently of quite thin lime-wood, the edge being formed
  <!-- Page 592 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page592"></a>[v.04
  p.0592]</span>probably by a thin band of iron. In the centre of the
  shield, in order to protect the hand which held it, was a strong iron
  boss, some 7 in. in diameter and projecting about 3 in. It is clear from
  literary evidence that the helmet (<i>helm</i>) and coat of chain mail
  (<i>byrne</i>) were also in common use. They are seldom found in graves,
  however, whether owing to the custom of heriots or to the fact that, on
  account of their relatively high value, they were frequently handed on
  from generation to generation as heirlooms. Greaves are not often
  mentioned. It is worth noting that in later times the heriot of an
  "ordinary thegn" (<i>medema þegn</i>)&mdash;by which is meant apparently
  not a king's thegn but a man of the <i>twelfhynde</i>
  class&mdash;consisted of his horse with its saddle, &amp;c. and his arms,
  or two pounds of silver as an equivalent of the whole. The arms required
  were probably a sword, helmet, coat of mail and one or two spears and
  shields. There are distinct indications that a similar outfit was fairly
  common in Ine's time, and that its value was much the same. One would
  scarcely be justified, however, in supposing that it was anything like
  universal; for the purchasing power of such a sum was at that time
  considerable, representing as it did about 16-20 oxen or 100-120 sheep.
  It would hardly be safe to credit men of the <i>sixhynde</i> class in
  general with more than a horse, spear and shield.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Agriculture and Village Life.</i>&mdash;There is no doubt that a
  fairly advanced system of agriculture must have been known to the
  Anglo-Saxons before they settled in Britain. This is made clear above all
  by the representation of a plough drawn by two oxen in one of the very
  ancient rock-carvings at Tegneby in Bohuslän. In Domesday Book the heavy
  plough with eight oxen seems to be universal, and it can be traced back
  in Kent to the beginning of the 9th century. In this kingdom the system
  of agricultural terminology was based on it. The unit was the
  <i>sulung</i> (<i>aratrum</i>) or ploughland (from <i>sulh</i>,
  "plough"), the fourth part of which was the <i>geocled</i> or <i>geoc</i>
  (<i>jugum</i>), originally a yoke of oxen. An analogy is supplied by the
  <i>carucata</i> of the Danelagh, the eighth part of which was the
  <i>bouata</i> or "ox-land." In the 10th century the <i>sulung</i> seems
  to have been identified with the hide, but in earlier times it contained
  apparently two hides. The hide itself, which was the regular unit in the
  other kingdoms, usually contained 120 acres in later times and was
  divided into four <i>girda</i> (<i>virgatae</i>) or yardlands. But
  originally it seems to have meant simply the land pertaining to a
  household, and its area in early times is quite uncertain, though
  probably far less. For the acre also there was in later times a standard
  length and breadth, the former being called <i>furhlang</i>
  (<i>furlong</i>) and reckoned at one-eighth of a mile, while the
  <i>aecerbraedu</i> or "acre-breadth" (chain) was also a definite measure.
  We need not doubt, however, that in practice the form of the acre was
  largely conditioned by the nature of the ground. Originally it is thought
  to have been the measure of a day's ploughing, in which case the
  dimensions given above would scarcely be reached. Account must also be
  taken of the possibility that in early times lighter teams were in
  general use. If so the normal dimensions of the acre may very well have
  been quite different.</p>

  <p>The husbandry was of a co-operative character. In the 11th century it
  was distinctly unusual for a peasant to possess a whole team of his own,
  and there is no reason for supposing the case to have been otherwise in
  early times; for though the peasant might then hold a hide, the hide
  itself was doubtless smaller and not commensurate in any way with the
  ploughland. The holdings were probably not compact but consisted of
  scattered strips in common fields, changed perhaps from year to year, the
  choice being determined by lot or otherwise. As for the method of
  cultivation itself there is little or no evidence. Both the "two-course
  system" and the "three-course system" may have been in use; but on the
  other hand it is quite possible that in many cases the same ground was
  not sown more than once in three years. The prevalence of the
  co-operative principle, it may be observed, was doubtless due in large
  measure to the fact that the greater part of England, especially towards
  the east, was settled not in scattered farms or hamlets but in compact
  villages with the cultivated lands lying round them.</p>

  <p>The mill was another element which tended to promote the same
  principle. There can be little doubt that before the Anglo-Saxons came to
  Britain they possessed no instrument for grinding corn except the quern
  (<i>cweorn</i>), and in remote districts this continued in use until
  quite late times. The grinding seems to have been performed chiefly by
  female slaves, but occasionally we hear also of a donkey-mill
  (<i>esolcweorn</i>). The mill proper, however, which was derived from the
  Romans, as its name (<i>mylen</i>, from Lat. <i>molina</i>) indicates,
  must have come into use fairly early. In the 11th century every village
  of any size seems to have possessed one, while the earliest references go
  back to the 8th century. It is not unlikely that they were in use during
  the Roman occupation of Britain, and consequently that they became known
  to the invaders almost from the first. The mills were presumably driven
  for the most part by water, though we have a reference to a windmill as
  early as the year 833.</p>

  <p>All the ordinary domestic animals were known. Cattle and sheep were
  pastured on the common lands appertaining to the village, while pigs,
  which (especially in Kent) seem to have been very numerous, were kept in
  the woods. Bee-keeping was also practised. In all these matters the
  invasion of Britain had brought about no change. The cultivation of fruit
  and vegetables on the other hand was probably almost entirely new. The
  names are almost all derived from Latin, though most of them seem to have
  been known soon after the invasion, at all events by the 7th century.</p>

  <p>From the considerations pointed out above we can hardly doubt that the
  village possessed a certain amount of corporate life, centred perhaps in
  an ale-house where its affairs were discussed by the inhabitants. There
  is no evidence, however, which would justify us in crediting such
  gatherings with any substantial degree of local authority. So far as the
  limited information at our disposal enables us to form an opinion, the
  responsibility both for the internal peace of the village, and for its
  obligations to the outside world, seems to have lain with the lord or his
  steward (<i>gerefa</i>, <i>villicus</i>) from the beginning. A quite
  opposite view has, it is true, found favour with many scholars, viz. that
  the villages were orginally settlements of free kindreds, and that the
  lord's authority was superimposed on them at a later date. This view is
  based mainly on the numerous place-names ending in <i>-ing</i>,
  <i>-ingham</i>, <i>-ington</i>, &amp;c., in which the syllable
  <i>-ing</i> is thought to refer to kindreds of cultivators. It is more
  probable, however, that these names are derived from persons of the
  <i>twelfhynde</i> class to whom the land had been granted. In many cases
  indeed there is good reason for doubting whether the name is a patronymic
  at all.</p>

  <p>The question how far the villages were really new settlements is
  difficult to answer, for the terminations <i>-ham</i>, <i>-ton</i>,
  &amp;c. cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence. Thus according to the
  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ann. 571) Bensington and Eynsham were formerly
  British villages. Even if the first part of Egonesham is
  English&mdash;which is by no means certain&mdash;it is hardly sufficient
  reason for discrediting this statement, for Canterbury
  (<i>Cantwaraburg</i>) and Rochester (<i>Hrofes ceaster</i>) were without
  doubt Roman places in spite of their English names. On the whole it seems
  likely that the cultivation of the land was not generally interrupted for
  more than a very few years; hence the convenience of utilizing existing
  sites of villages would be obvious, even if the buildings themselves had
  been burnt.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Towns.</i>&mdash;Gildas states that in the time of the Romans
  Britain contained twenty-eight cities (<i>civitates</i>), besides a
  number of fortresses (<i>castetta</i>). Most of these were situated
  within the territories eventually occupied by the invaders, and reappear
  as towns in later times. Their history in the intervening period,
  however, is wrapped in obscurity. Chester appears to have been deserted
  for three centuries after its destruction early in the 7th century, and
  in most of the other cases there are features observable in the situation
  and plan of the medieval town which suggest that its occupation had not
  been continuous. Yet London and Canterbury must have recovered a certain
  amount of importance quite early, at all events within two centuries
  after the invasion, and the same is probably true of York, <!-- Page 593
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page593"></a>[v.04
  p.0593]</span>Lincoln and a few other places. The term applied to both
  the cities and the fortresses of the Romans was <i>ceaster</i> (Lat.
  <i>castra</i>), less frequently the English word <i>burg</i>. There is
  little or no evidence for the existence of towns other than Roman in
  early times, for the word <i>urbs</i> is merely a translation of
  <i>burg</i>, which was used for any fortified dwelling-place, and it is
  improbable that anything which could properly be called a town was known
  to the invaders before their arrival in Britain. The Danish settlements
  at the end of the 9th century and the defensive system initiated by King
  Alfred gave birth to a new series of fortified towns, from which the
  boroughs of the middle ages are mainly descended.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Houses.</i>&mdash;Owing to the fact that houses were built
  entirely of perishable materials, wood and wattle, we are necessarily
  dependent almost wholly upon literary evidence for knowledge of this
  subject. Stone seems to have been used first for churches, but this was
  not before the 7th century, and we are told that at first masons were
  imported from Gaul. Indeed wood was used for many churches, as well as
  for most secular buildings, until a much later period. The walls were
  formed either of stout planks laid together vertically or horizontally,
  or else of posts at a short distance from one another, the interstices
  being filled up with wattlework daubed with clay. It is not unlikely that
  the houses of wealthy persons were distinguished by a good deal of
  ornamentation in carving and painting. The roof was high-pitched and
  covered with straw, hay, reeds or tiles. The regular form of the
  buildings was rectangular, the gable sides probably being shorter than
  the others. There is little evidence for partitions inside, and in
  wealthy establishments the place of rooms seems to have been supplied by
  separate buildings within the same enclosure. The windows must have been
  mere openings in the walls or roof, for glass was not used for this
  purpose before the latter part of the 7th century. Stoves were known, but
  most commonly heat was obtained from an open fire in the centre of the
  building. Of the various buildings in a wealthy establishment the chief
  were the hall (<i>heall</i>), which was both a dining and reception room,
  and the "lady's bower" (<i>brydbur</i>), which served also as a bedroom
  for the master and mistress. To these we have to add buildings for the
  attendants, kitchen, bakehouse, &amp;c., and farm buildings. There is
  little or no evidence for the use of two-storeyed houses in early times,
  though in the 10th and 11th centuries they were common. The whole group
  of buildings stood in an enclosure (<i>tun</i>) surrounded by a stockade
  (<i>burg</i>), which perhaps rested on an earthwork, though this is
  disputed. Similarly the homestead of the peasant was surrounded by a
  fence (<i>edor</i>).</p>

  <p>9. <i>Clothes.</i>&mdash;The chief material for clothing was at first
  no doubt wool, though linen must also have been used and later became
  fairly common. The chief garments were the coat (<i>roc</i>), the
  trousers (<i>brec</i>), and the cloak, for which there seem to have been
  a number of names (<i>loða</i>, <i>hacele</i>, <i>sciccing</i>,
  <i>pad</i>, <i>hwitel</i>). To these we may add the hat (<i>haet</i>),
  belt (<i>gyrdel</i>), stockings (<i>hosa</i>), shoes (<i>scoh</i>,
  <i>gescy</i>, <i>rifeling</i>) and gloves (<i>glof</i>). The
  <i>crusene</i> was a fur coat, while the <i>serc</i> or <i>smoc</i> seems
  to have been an undergarment and probably sleeveless. The whole attire
  was of national origin and had probably been in use long before the
  invasion of Britain. In the great bog-deposit at Thorsbjaerg in Angel,
  which dates from about the 4th century, there were found a coat with long
  sleeves, in a fair state of preservation, a pair of long trousers with
  remains of socks attached, several shoes and portions of square cloaks,
  one of which had obviously been dyed green. The dress of the upper
  classes must have been of a somewhat gorgeous character, especially when
  account is taken of the brooches and other ornaments which they wore. It
  is worth noting that according to Jordanes the Swedes in the 6th century
  were splendidly dressed.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Trade.</i>&mdash;The few notices of this subject which occur in
  the early laws seem to refer primarily to cattle-dealing. But there can
  be no doubt that a considerable import and export trade with the
  continent had sprung up quite early. In Bede's time, if not before,
  London was resorted to by many merchants both by land and by sea. At
  first the chief export trade was probably in slaves. English slaves were
  to be obtained in Rome even before the end of the 6th century, as appears
  from the well-known story of Gregory the Great. Since the standard price
  of slaves on the continent was in general three or four times as great as
  it was in England, the trade must have been very profitable. After the
  adoption of Christianity it was gradually prohibited by the laws. The
  nature of the imports during the heathen period may be learned chiefly
  from the graves, which contain many brooches and other ornaments of
  continental origin, and also a certain number of silver, bronze and glass
  vessels. With the introduction of Christianity the ecclesiastical
  connexion between England and the continent without doubt brought about a
  large increase in the imports of secular as well as religious objects,
  and the frequency of pilgrimages by persons of high rank must have had
  the same effect. The use of silk (<i>seoluc</i>) and the adoption of the
  mancus (see below) point to communication, direct or indirect, with more
  distant countries. In the 8th century we hear frequently of tolls on
  merchant ships at various ports, especially London.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Coinage.</i>&mdash;The earliest coins which can be identified
  with certainty are some silver pieces which bear in Runic letters the
  name of the Mercian king Æthelred (675-704). There are others, however,
  of the same type and standard (about 21 grains) which may be attributed
  with probability to his father Penda (d. 655). But it is clear from the
  laws of Æthelberht that a regular silver coinage was in use at least half
  a century before this time, and it is not unlikely that many unidentified
  coins may go back to the 6th century. These are fairly numerous, and are
  either without inscriptions or, if they do bear letters at all, they seem
  to be mere corruptions of Roman legends. Their designs are derived from
  Roman or Frankish coins, especially the former, and their weight varies
  from about 10 to 21 grains, though the very light coins are rare.
  Anonymous gold coins, resembling Frankish trientes in type and standard
  (21 grains), are also fairly common, though they must have passed out of
  use very early, as the laws give no hint of their existence. Larger gold
  coins (<i>solidi</i>) are very rare. In the early laws the money actually
  in use appears to have been entirely silver. In Offa's time a new gold
  coin, the <i>mancus</i>, resembling in standard the Roman solidus (about
  70 grains), was introduced from Mahommedan countries. The oldest extant
  specimen bears a faithfully copied Arabic inscription. In the same reign
  the silver coins underwent a considerable change in type, being made
  larger and thinner, while from this time onwards they always bore the
  name of the king (or queen or archbishop) for whom they were issued. The
  design and execution also became remarkably good. Their weight was at
  first unaffected, but probably towards the close of Offa's reign it was
  raised to about 23 grains, at which standard it seems to have remained,
  nominally at least, until the time of Alfred. It is to be observed that
  with the exception of Burgred's coins and a few anonymous pieces the
  silver was never adulterated. No bronze coins were current except in
  Northumbria, where they were extremely common in the 9th century.</p>

  <p>Originally <i>scilling</i> ("shilling") and <i>sceatt</i> seem to have
  been the terms for gold and silver coins respectively. By the time of
  Ine, however, <i>pending</i>, <i>pen(n)ing</i> ("penny"), had already
  come into use for the latter, while, owing to the temporary disappearance
  of a gold coinage, <i>scilling</i> had come to denote a mere unit of
  account. It was, however, a variable unit, for the Kentish shilling
  contained twenty <i>sceattas</i> (pence), while the Mercian contained
  only four. The West Saxon shilling seems originally to have been
  identical with the Mercian, but later it contained five pence. Large
  payments were generally made by weight, 240-250 pence being reckoned to
  the pound, perhaps from the 7th century onwards. The mancus was equated
  with thirty pence, probably from the time of its introduction. This means
  that the value of gold relatively to silver was 10:1 from the end of
  Offa's reign. There is reason, however, for thinking that in earlier
  times it was as low as 6:1, or even 5:1. In Northumbria a totally
  different monetary system prevailed, the unit being the <i>tryms</i>,
  which contained three <i>sceattas</i> or pence. As to the value of the
  bronze coins we are without information.</p>

<p><!-- Page 594 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page594"></a>[v.04 p.0594]</span></p>

  <p>The purchasing power of money was very great. The sheep was valued at
  a shilling in both Wessex and Mercia, from early times till the 11th
  century. One pound was the normal price of a slave and half a pound that
  of a horse. The price of a pig was twice, and that of an ox six times as
  great as that of a sheep. Regarding the prices of commodities other than
  live-stock we have little definite information, though an approximate
  estimate may be made of the value of arms. It is worth noticing that we
  often hear of payments in gold and silver vessels in place of money. In
  the former case the mancus was the usual unit of calculation.</p>

  <p>12. <i>Ornaments.</i>&mdash;Of these the most interesting are the
  brooches which were worn by both sexes and of which large numbers have
  been found in heathen cemeteries. They may be classed under eight leading
  types: (1) circular or ring-shaped, (2) cruciform, (3) square-headed, (4)
  radiated, (5) S-shaped, (6) bird-shaped, (7) disk-shaped, (8) cupelliform
  or saucer-shaped. Of these Nos. 5 and 6 appear to be of continental
  origin, and this is probably the case also with No. 4 and in part with
  No. 7. But the last-mentioned type varies greatly, from rude and almost
  plain disks of bronze to magnificent gold specimens studded with gems.
  No. 8 is believed to be peculiar to England, and occurs chiefly in the
  southern Midlands, specimens being usually found in pairs. The interiors
  are gilt, often furnished with detachable plates and sometimes set with
  brilliants. The remaining types were probably brought over by the
  Anglo-Saxons at the time of the invasion. Nos. 1 and 3 are widespread
  outside England, but No. 2, though common in Scandinavian countries, is
  hardly to be met with south of the Elbe. It is worth noting that a number
  of specimens were found in the cremation cemetery at Borgstedterfeld near
  Rendsburg. In England it occurs chiefly in the more northern counties.
  Nos. 2 and 3 vary greatly in size, from 2½ to 7 in. or more. The smaller
  specimens are quite plain, but the larger ones are gilt and generally of
  a highly ornamental character. In later times we hear of brooches worth
  as much as six mancusas, <i>i.e.</i> equivalent to six oxen.</p>

  <p>Among other ornaments we may mention hairpins, rings and ear-rings,
  and especially buckles which are often of elaborate workmanship.
  Bracelets and necklets are not very common, a fact which is rather
  surprising, as in early times, before the issuing of a coinage, these
  articles (<i>beagas</i>) took the place of money to a large extent. The
  glass vessels are finely made and of somewhat striking appearance, though
  they closely resemble contemporary continental types. Since the art of
  glass-working was unknown, according to Bede, until nearly the end of the
  7th century, it is probable that these were all of continental or
  Roman-British origin.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Amusements</i>.&mdash;It is clear from the frequent references
  to dogs and hawks in the charters that hunting and falconry were keenly
  pursued by the kings and their retinues. Games, whether indoor or
  outdoor, are much less frequently mentioned, but there is no doubt that
  the use of dice (<i>taefl</i>) was widespread. At court much time was
  given to poetic recitation, often accompanied by music, and accomplished
  poets received liberal rewards. The chief musical instrument was the harp
  (<i>hearpe</i>), which is often mentioned. Less frequently we hear of the
  flute (<i>pipe</i>) and later also of the fiddle (<i>fiðele</i>).
  Trumpets (<i>horn</i>, <i>swegelhorn</i>, <i>byme</i>) appear to have
  been used chiefly as signals.</p>

  <p>14. <i>Writing.</i>&mdash;The Runic alphabet seems to have been the
  only form of writing known to the Anglo-Saxons before the invasion of
  Britain, and indeed until the adoption of Christianity. In its earliest
  form, as it appears in inscriptions on various articles found in
  Schleswig and in Scandinavian countries, it consisted of twenty-four
  letters, all of which occur in abecedaria in England. In actual use,
  however, two letters soon became obsolete, but a number of others were
  added from time to time, some of which are found also on the continent,
  while others are peculiar to certain parts of England. Originally the
  Runic alphabet seems to have been used for writing on wooden boards,
  though none of these have survived. The inscriptions which have come down
  to us are engraved partly on memorial stones, which are not uncommon in
  the north of England, and partly on various metal objects, ranging from
  swords to brooches. The adoption of Christianity brought about the
  introduction of the Roman alphabet; but the older form of writing did not
  immediately pass out of use, for almost all the inscriptions which we
  possess date from the 7th or following centuries. Coins with Runic
  legends were issued at least until the middle of the 8th century, and
  some of the memorial stones date probably even from the 9th. The most
  important of the latter are the column at Bewcastle, Cumberland, believed
  to commemorate Alhfrith, the son of Oswio, who died about 670, and the
  cross at Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, which is probably about a century
  later. The Roman alphabet was very soon applied to the purpose of writing
  the native language, <i>e.g.</i> in the publication of the laws of
  Æthelberht. Yet the type of character in which even the earliest
  surviving MSS. are written is believed to be of Celtic origin. Most
  probably it was introduced by the Irish missionaries who evangelized the
  north of England, though Welsh influence is scarcely impossible.
  Eventually this alphabet was enlarged (probably before the end of the 7th
  century) by the inclusion of two Runic letters for <i>th</i> and
  <i>w</i>.</p>

  <p>15. <i>Marriage.</i>&mdash;This is perhaps the subject on which our
  information is most inadequate. It is evident that the relationships
  which prohibited marriage were different from those recognized by the
  Church; but the only fact which we know definitely is that it was
  customary, at least in Kent, for a man to marry his stepmother. In the
  Kentish laws marriage is represented as hardly more than a matter of
  purchase; but whether this was the case in the other kingdoms also the
  evidence at our disposal is insufficient to decide. We know, however,
  that in addition to the sum paid to the bride's guardian, it was
  customary for the bridegroom to make a present (<i>morgengifu</i>) to the
  bride herself, which, in the case of queens, often consisted of a
  residence and considerable estates. Such persons also had retinues and
  fortified residences of their own. In the Kentish laws provision is made
  for widows to receive a proportionate share in their husbands'
  property.</p>

  <p>16. <i>Funeral Rites.</i>&mdash;Both inhumation and cremation were
  practised in heathen times. The former seems to have prevailed
  everywhere; the latter, however, was much more common in the more
  northern counties than in the south, though cases are fairly numerous
  throughout the valley of the Thames. In <i>Beowulf</i> cremation is
  represented as the prevailing custom. There is no evidence that it was
  still practised when the Roman and Celtic missionaries arrived, but it is
  worth noting that according to the tradition given in the Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle, Oxfordshire, where the custom seems to have been fairly
  common, was not conquered before the latter part of the 6th century. The
  burnt remains were generally, if not always, enclosed in urns and then
  buried. The urns themselves are of clay, somewhat badly baked, and bear
  geometrical patterns applied with a punch. They vary considerably in size
  (from 4 to 12 in. or more in diameter) and closely resemble those found
  in northern Germany. Inhumation graves are sometimes richly furnished.
  The skeleton is laid out at full length, generally with the head towards
  the west or north, a spear at one side and a sword and shield obliquely
  across the middle. Valuable brooches and other ornaments are often found.
  In many other cases, however, the grave contained nothing except a small
  knife and a simple brooch or a few beads. Usually both classes of graves
  lie below the natural surface of the ground without any perceptible trace
  of a barrow.</p>

  <p>17. <i>Religion.</i>&mdash;Here again the information at our disposal
  is very limited. There can be little doubt that the heathen Angli
  worshipped certain gods, among them Ti (Tig), Woden, Thunor and a goddess
  Frigg, from whom the names Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are
  derived. Ti was probably the same god of whom early Roman writers speak
  under the name Mars (see <span class="sc">Týr</span>), while Thunor was
  doubtless the thunder-god (see <span class="sc">Thor</span>). From Woden
  (<i>q.v.</i>) most of the royal families traced their descent. Seaxneat,
  the ancestor of the East Saxon dynasty, was also in all probability a god
  (see <span class="sc">Essex, Kingdom of</span>).</p>

<p><!-- Page 595 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page595"></a>[v.04 p.0595]</span></p>

  <p>Of anthropomorphic representations of the gods we have no clear
  evidence, though we do hear of shrines in sacred enclosures, at which
  sacrifices were offered. It is clear also that there were persons
  specially set apart for the priesthood, who were not allowed to bear arms
  or to ride except on mares. Notices of sacred trees and groves, springs,
  stones, &amp;c., are much more frequent than those referring to the gods.
  We hear also a good deal of witches and valkyries, and of charms and
  magic; as an instance we may cite the fact that certain (Runic) letters
  were credited, as in the North, with the power of loosening bonds. It is
  probable also that the belief in the spirit world and in a future life
  was of a somewhat similar kind to what we find in Scandinavian religion.

  <p><b>BRITANNICUS</b>, son of the Roman emperor Claudius by his third

  was originally called Claudius Tiberius Germanicus, and received the name
  Britannicus from the senate on account of the conquest made in Britain
  about the time of his birth. Till 48, the date of his mother's execution,
  he was looked upon as the heir presumptive; but Agrippina, the new wife
  of Claudius, soon persuaded the feeble emperor to adopt Lucius Domitius,
  known later as Nero, her son by a previous marriage. After the accession
  of Nero, Agrippina, by playing on his fears, induced him to poison
  Britannicus at a banquet (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 55). A golden
  statue of the young prince was set up by the emperor Titus. Britannicus
  is the subject of a tragedy by Racine.</p>

  <p><b>BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA</b>, the general name given to the British
  protectorates in South Central Africa north of the Zambezi river, but
  more particularly to a large territory lying between 8° 25&prime; S. on
  Lake Tanganyika and 17° 6&prime; S. on the river Shiré, near its
  confluence with the Zambezi, and between 36° 10&prime; E. (district of
  Mlanje) and 26° 30&prime; E. (river Luengwe-Kafukwe). Originally the term
  "British Central Africa" was applied by Sir H.H. Johnston to all the
  territories under British influence north of the Zambezi which were
  formerly intended to be under one administration; but the course of
  events having prevented the connexion of Barotseland (see <span
  class="sc">Barotse</span>) and the other Rhodesian territories with the
  more direct British administration north of the Zambezi, the name of
  British Central Africa was confined officially (in 1893) to the British
  protectorate on the Shiré and about Lake Nyasa. In 1907 the official
  title of the protectorate was changed to that of Nyasaland Protectorate,
  while the titles "North Eastern Rhodesia" and "North Western Rhodesia"
  (Barotseland) have been given to the two divisions of the British South
  Africa Company's territory north of the Zambezi. The western boundary,
  however, of the territory here described has been taken to be a line
  drawn from near the source of the Lualaba on the southern boundary of
  Belgian Congo to the western source of the Luanga river, and thence the
  course of the Luanga to its junction with the Luengwe-Kafukwe, after
  which the main course of the Kafukwe delimits the territory down to the
  Zambezi. Thus, besides the Nyasaland Protectorate and North Eastern
  Rhodesia, part of North Western Rhodesia is included, and for the whole
  of this region British Central Africa is the most convenient
  designation.</p>

  <p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;Within these limits we have a
  territory of about 250,000 sq. m., which includes two-thirds of Lake
  Nyasa, the south end of Lake Tanganyika, more than half Lake Mweru, and
  the whole of Lake Bangweulu, nearly the whole courses of the rivers Shiré
  and Luangwa (or Loangwa), the whole of the river Chambezi (the most
  remote of the headwaters of the river Congo), the right or east bank of
  the Luapula (or upper Congo) from its exit from Lake Bangweulu to its
  issue from the north end of Lake Mweru; also the river Luanga and the
  whole course of the Kafue or Kafukwe.<a name="FnAnchor_101"
  href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Other lesser sheets of water
  included within the limits of this territory are the Great Mweru Swamp,
  between Tanganyika and Mweru, Moir's Lake (a small mountain
  tarn&mdash;possibly a crater lake&mdash;lying between the Luangwa and the
  Luapula), Lake Malombe (on the upper Shiré), and the salt lake Chilwa
  (wrongly styled Shirwa, being the Bantu word <i>Kilwa</i>), which lies on
  the borders of the Portuguese province of Moçambique. The southern border
  of this territory is the north bank of the Zambezi from the confluence of
  the Kafukwe to that of the Luangwa at Zumbo. Eastwards of Zumbo, British
  Central Africa is separated from the river Zambezi by the Portuguese
  possessions; nevertheless, considerably more than two-thirds of the
  country lies within the Zambezi basin, and is included within the
  subordinate basins of Lake Nyasa and of the rivers Luangwa and
  Luengwe-Kafukwe. The remaining portions drain into the basins of the
  river Congo and of Lake Tanganyika, and also into the small lake or
  half-dried swamp called Chilwa, which at the present time has no outlet,
  though in past ages it probably emptied itself into the Lujenda river,
  and thence into the Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p>As regards orographical features, much of the country is high plateau,
  with an average altitude of 3500 ft. above sea-level. Only a very minute
  portion of its area&mdash;the country along the banks of the river
  Shiré&mdash;lies at anything like a low elevation; though the Luangwa
  valley may not be more than about 900 ft. above sea-level. Lake Nyasa
  lies at an elevation of 1700 ft. above the sea, is about 350 m. long,
  with a breadth varying from 15 to 40 m. Lake Tanganyika is about 2600 ft.
  above sea-level, with a length of about 400 m. and an average breadth of
  nearly 40 m. Lake Mweru and Lake Bangweulu are respectively 3000 and 3760
  ft. above sea-level; Lake Chilwa is 1946 ft. in altitude. The highest
  mountain found within the limits previously laid down is Mount Mlanje, in
  the extreme south-eastern corner of the protectorate. This remarkable and
  picturesque mass is an isolated "chunk" of the Archean plateau, through
  which at a later date there has been a volcanic outburst of basalt. The
  summit and sides of this mass exhibit several craters. The highest peak
  of Mlanje reaches an altitude of 9683 ft. (In German territory, near the
  north end of Lake Nyasa, and close to the British frontier, is Mount
  Rungwe, the altitude of which exceeds 10,000 ft.) Other high mountains
  are Mounts Chongone and Dedza, in Angoniland, which reach an altitude of
  7000 ft., and points on the Nyika Plateau and in the Konde Mountains to
  the north-west of Lake Nyasa, which probably exceed a height of 8000 ft.
  There are also Mounts Zomba (6900 ft.) and Chiradzulu (5500 ft.) in the
  Shiré Highlands. The principal plateaus or high ridges are (1) the Shiré
  Highlands, a clump of mountainous country lying between the river Shiré,
  the river Ruo, Lake Chilwa and the south end of Lake Nyasa; (2)
  Angoniland&mdash;a stretch of elevated country to the west of Lake Nyasa
  and the north-west of the river <!-- Page 596 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page596"></a>[v.04 p.0596]</span>Shiré; (3) the Nyika Plateau,
  which lies to the north of Angoniland; and (4) the Nyasa-Tanganyika
  Plateau, between the basin of the river Luangwa, the vicinity of
  Tanganyika and the vicinity of Lake Mweru (highest point, 7000-8000 ft.).
  Finally may be mentioned the tract of elevated country between Lake
  Bangweulu and the river Luapula, and between Lake Bangweulu and the basin
  of the Luangwa; and also the Lukinga (Mushinga) or Ugwara Mountains of
  North Western Rhodesia, which attain perhaps to altitudes of 6000 ft.</p>

  <p>The whole of this part of Africa is practically without any stretch of
  desert country, being on the whole favoured with an abundant rainfall.
  The nearest approach to a desert is the rather dry land to the east and
  north-east of Lake Mweru. Here, and in parts of the lower Shiré district,
  the annual rainfall probably does not exceed an average of 35 in.
  Elsewhere, in the vicinity of the highest mountains, the rainfall may
  attain an average of 75 in., in parts of Mount Mlanje possibly often
  reaching to 100 in. in the year. The average may be put at 50 in. per
  annum, which is also about the average rainfall of the Shiré Highlands,
  that part of British Central Africa which at present attracts the
  greatest number of European settlers.</p>

  <p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The whole formation is Archean and Primary (with
  a few modern plutonic outbursts), and chiefly consists of granite,
  felspar, quartz, gneiss, schists, amphibolite and other Archean rocks,
  with Primary sandstones and limestones in the basin of Lake Nyasa (a
  great rift depression), the river Shiré, and the regions within the
  northern watershed of the Zambezi river. Sandstones of Karroo age occur
  in the basin of the Luangwa (N.E. Rhodesia). There are evidences of
  recent volcanic activity on the summit of the small Mlanje plateau (S.E.
  corner of the protectorate: here there are two extinct craters with a
  basaltic outflow), and at the north end of Lake Nyasa and the eastern
  edge of the Tanganyika plateau. Here there are many craters and much
  basalt, or even lava; also hot springs.</p>

  <p><i>Metals and Minerals.</i>&mdash;Gold has been found in the Shiré
  Highlands, in the hills along the Nyasa-Zambezi waterparting, and in the
  mountainous region west of Lake Nyasa; silver (galena, silver-lead) in
  the hills of the Nyasa-Zambezi waterparting; lead in the same district;
  graphite in the western basin of Lake Nyasa; copper (pyrites and pure
  ore) in the west Nyasa region and in the hills of North Western and North
  Eastern Rhodesia; iron ore almost universally; mica almost universally;
  coal occurs in the north and west Nyasa districts (especially in the
  Karroo sandstones of the Rukuru valley), and perhaps along the
  Zambezi-Nyasa waterparting; limestone in the Shiré basin; malachite in
  south-west Angoniland and North Western Rhodesia; and perhaps petroleum
  in places along the Nyasa-Zambezi waterparting. (See also <span
  class="sc">Rhodesia</span>.)</p>

  <p><i>Flora</i>.&mdash;No part of the country comes within the forest
  region of West Africa. The whole of it may be said to lie within the
  savannah or park-like division of the continent. As a general rule, the
  landscape is of a pleasing and attractive character, well covered with
  vegetation and fairly well watered. Actual forests of lofty trees,
  forests of a West African type, are few in number, and are chiefly
  limited to portions of the Nyika, Angoniland and Shiré Highlands
  plateaus, and to a few nooks in valleys near the south end of Tanganyika.
  Patches of forest of tropical luxuriance may still be seen on the slopes
  of Mounts Mlanje and Chiradzulu. On the upper plateaus of Mount Mlanje
  there are forests of a remarkable conifer (<i>Widdringtonia whytei</i>),
  a relation of the cypress, which in appearance resembles much more the
  cedar, and is therefore wrongly styled the "Mlanje cedar." This tree is
  remarkable as being the most northern form of a group of yew-like
  conifers confined otherwise to South Africa (Cape Colony). Immense areas
  in the lower-lying plains are covered by long, coarse grass, sometimes
  reaching 10 ft. in height. Most of the West African forest trees are
  represented in British Central Africa. A full list of the known flora has
  been compiled by Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer and his assistants at Kew, and is
  given in the first and second editions of Sir H. H. Johnston's work on
  British Central Africa. Amongst the principal vegetable products of the
  country interesting for commercial purposes may be mentioned tobacco
  (partly native varieties and partly introduced); coffee (wild coffee is
  said to grow in some of the mountainous districts, but the actual coffee
  cultivated by the European settlers has been introduced from abroad);
  rubber&mdash;derived chiefly from the various species of
  <i>Landolphia</i>, <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Clitandra</i>, <i>Carpodinus</i> and
  <i>Conopharygia</i>, and from other apocynaceous plants; the
  <i>Strophanthus</i> pod (furnishing a valuable drug); ground-nuts
  (<i>Arachis</i> and <i>Voandzeia</i>); the cotton plant; all African
  cultivated cereals (<i>Sorghum</i>, <i>Pennisetum</i>, maize, rice,
  wheat&mdash;cultivated chiefly by Europeans&mdash;and <i>Eleusine</i>);
  and six species of palms&mdash;the oil palm on the north-west (near Lake
  Nyasa, at the south end of Tanganyika and on the Luapula), the
  <i>Borassus</i> and <i>Hyphaene</i>, <i>Phoenix</i> (or wild date),
  <i>Raphia</i> and the coco-nut palm. The last named was introduced by
  Arabs and Europeans, and is found on Lake Nyasa and on the lower Shiré.
  Most of the European vegetables have been introduced, and thrive
  exceedingly well, especially the potato. The mango has also been
  introduced from India, and has taken to the Shiré Highlands as to a
  second home. Oranges, lemons and limes have been planted by Europeans and
  Arabs in a few districts. European fruit trees do not ordinarily
  flourish, though apples are grown to some extent at Blantyre. The vine
  hitherto has proved a failure. Pineapples give the best result among
  cultivated fruit, and strawberries do well in the higher districts. In
  the mountains the native wild brambles give blackberries of large size
  and excellent flavour. The vegetable product through which this
  protectorate first attracted trade was coffee, the export of which,
  however, has passed through very disheartening fluctuations. In
  1905-1906, 773,919 lb of coffee (value £16,123) were exported; but during
  this twelve months the crop of cotton&mdash;quite a newly developed
  product, rose to 776,621 lb, from 285,185 lb in 1904-1905. An equally
  marked increase in tobacco and ground-nuts (<i>Arachis</i>) has taken
  place. Beeswax is a rising export.</p>

  <p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The fauna is on the whole very rich. It has
  affinities in a few respects with the West African forest region, but
  differs slightly from the countries to the north and south by the absence
  of such animals as prefer drier climates, as for instance the oryx
  antelopes, gazelles and the ostrich. There is a complete blank in the
  distribution of this last between the districts to the south of the
  Zambezi and those of East Africa between Victoria Nyanza and the Indian
  Ocean. The giraffe is found in the Luanga valley; it is also met with in
  the extreme north-east of the country. The ordinary African rhinoceros is
  still occasionally, but very rarely, seen in the Shiré Highlands, The
  African elephant is fairly common throughout the whole territory. Lions
  and leopards are very abundant; the zebra is still found in great
  numbers, and belongs to the Central African variety of Burchell's zebra,
  which is completely striped down to the hoofs, and is intermediate in
  many particulars between the true zebra of the mountains and Burchell's
  zebra of the plains. The principal antelopes found are the sable and the
  roan (<i>Hippotragus</i>), five species of <i>Cobus</i> or waterbuck (the
  puku, the Senga puku, the lechwe, Crawshay's waterbuck and the common
  waterbuck); the pallah, tsessébe (<i>Damaliscus</i>), hartebeest,
  brindled gnu (perhaps two species), several duykers (including the large
  <i>Cephalophus sylvicultrix</i>), klipspringer, oribi, steinbok and
  reedbuck. Among tragelaphs are two or more bushbucks, the inyala, the
  water tragelaph (<i>Limnotragus selousi</i>), the kudu and Livingstone's
  eland. The only buffalo is the common Cape species. The hyaena is the
  spotted kind. The hunting dog is present. There are some seven species of
  monkeys, including two baboons and one colobus. The hippopotamus is found
  in the lakes and rivers, and all these sheets of water are infested with
  crocodiles, apparently belonging to but one species, the common Nile
  crocodile.</p>

  <p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The human race is represented by only one
  indigenous native type&mdash;the Negro. No trace is anywhere found of a
  Hamitic intermixture (unless perhaps at the north end of Lake Nyasa,
  where the physique of the native Awankonde recalls that of the Nilotic
  negro). Arabs from Zanzibar have settled in the country, but not, as far
  as is known, earlier than the beginning of the 19th century. As the
  present writer takes the general term "Negro" to include equally the
  Bantu, Hottentot, Bushman and Congo Pygmy, this designation will cover
  all the natives of British Central Africa. The Bantu races, however,
  exhibit in some parts signs of Hottentot or Bushman intermixture, and
  there are legends in some mountain districts, especially Mount Mlanje, of
  the former existence of unmixed Bushman tribes, while Bushman stone
  implements are found at the south end of Tanganyika. At the present day
  the population is, as a rule, of a black or chocolate-coloured Negro
  type, and belongs, linguistically, entirely and exclusively to the Bantu
  family. The languages spoken offer several very interesting forms of
  Bantu speech, notably in the districts between the north end of Lake
  Nyasa, the south end of Lake Tanganyika, and the river Luapula. In the
  more or less plateau country included within these geographical limits,
  the Bantu dialects are of an archaic type, and to the present writer it
  has seemed as though one of them, Kibemba or Kiwemba, came near to the
  original form of the Bantu mother-language, though not nearer than the
  interesting Subiya of southern Barotseland. Through dialects spoken on
  the west and north of Tanganyika, these languages of North Eastern
  Rhodesia and northern Nyasaland and of the Kafukwe basin are connected
  with the Bantu languages of Uganda. They also offer a slight resemblance
  to Zulu-Kaffir, and it would seem as though the Zulu-Kaffir race must
  have come straight down from the countries to the north-east of
  Tanganyika, across the Zambezi, to their present home. Curiously enough,
  some hundreds of years after this southward migration, intestine wars and
  conflicts actually determined a north-eastward return migration of Zulus.
  From Matabeleland, Zulu tribes crossed the Zambezi at various periods
  (commencing from about 1820), and gradually extended their ravages and
  dominion over the plateaus to the west, north and north-east of Lake
  Nyasa. The Zulu language is still spoken by the dominating caste in West
  <!-- Page 597 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page597"></a>[v.04
  p.0597]</span>Nyasaland (see further <span class="sc">Zululand</span>:
  <i>Ethnology</i>; <span class="sc">Rhodesia</span>: <i>Ethnology</i>; and
  <span class="sc">Yaos</span>). As regards foreign settlers in this part
  of Africa, the Arabs may be mentioned first, though they are now met with
  only in very small numbers. The Arabs undoubtedly first <i>heard</i> of
  this rich country&mdash;rich not alone in natural products such as ivory,
  but also in slaves of good quality&mdash;from their settlements near the
  delta of the river Zambezi, and these settlements may date back to an
  early period, and might be coeval with the suggested pre-Islamite Arab
  settlements in the gold-bearing regions of South East Africa. But the
  Arabs do not seem to have made much progress in their penetration of the
  country in the days before firearms; and when firearms came into use they
  were for a long time forestalled by the Portuguese, who ousted them from
  the Zambezi. But about the beginning of the 19th century the increasing
  power and commercial enterprise of the Arab sultanate of Zanzibar caused
  the Arabs of Maskat and Zanzibar to march inland from the east coast.
  They gradually founded strong slave-trading settlements on the east and
  west coasts of Lake Nyasa, and thence westwards to Tanganyika and the
  Luapula. They never came in great numbers, however, and, except here and
  there on the coast of Lake Nyasa, have left no mixed descendants in the
  population. The total native population of all British Central Africa is
  about 2,000,000, that of the Nyasaland Protectorate being officially
  estimated in 1907 at 927,355. Of Europeans the protectorate possesses
  about 600 to 700 settlers, including some 100 officials. (For the
  European population of the other territories, see <span
  class="sc">Rhodesia</span>.) The Europeans of British Central Africa are
  chiefly natives of the United Kingdom or South Africa, but there are a
  few Germans, Dutchmen, French, Italians and Portuguese. The protectorate
  has also attracted a number of Indian traders (over 400), besides whom
  about 150 British Indian soldiers (Sikhs) are employed as the nucleus of
  an armed force.<a name="FnAnchor_102"
  href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Trade and Communications.</i>&mdash;The total value of the trade of
  the protectorate in the year 1899-1900 was £255,384, showing an increase
  of 75% on the figures for the previous year, 1898-1899. Imports were
  valued at £176,035, an increase of 62%, and exports at £79,449, an
  increase of 109%. In 1905-1906 the imports reached £222,581 and the
  exports £56,778. The value of imports into the Rhodesian provinces during
  the same period was about £50,000, excluding railway material, and the
  exports £18,000. The principal exports are (besides minerals) coffee,
  cotton, tobacco, rubber and ivory. A number of Englishmen and Scotsmen
  (perhaps 200) are settled, mainly in the Shiré Highlands, as coffee
  planters.</p>

  <p>From the Chinde mouth of the Zambezi to Port Herald on the lower Shiré
  communication is maintained by light-draught steamers, though in the dry
  season (April-November) steamers cannot always ascend as far as Port
  Herald, and barges have to be used to complete the voyage. A railway runs
  from Port Herald to Blantyre, the commercial capital of the Shiré
  Highlands. The "Cape to Cairo" railway, which crossed the Zambezi in 1905
  and the Kafukwe in 1906, reached the Broken Hill mine in 1907, and in
  1909 was continued to the frontier of Belgian Congo. There are regular
  services by steamer between the ports on Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika. The
  African trans-continental telegraph line (founded by Cecil Rhodes) runs
  through the protectorate, and a branch line has been established from
  Lake Nyasa to Fort Jameson, the present headquarters of the Chartered
  Company in North Eastern Rhodesia.</p>

  <p><i>Towns.</i>&mdash;The principal European settlement or town is
  Blantyre (<i>q.v.</i>), at a height of about 3000 ft. above the sea, in
  the Shiré Highlands. This place was named after Livingstone's birthplace,
  and was founded in 1876 by the Church of Scotland mission. The government
  capital of the protectorate, however, is Zomba, at the base of the
  mountain of that name. Other townships or sites of European settlements
  are Port Herald (on the lower Shiré), Chiromo (at the junction of the Ruo
  and the Shiré), Fort Anderson (on Mount Mlanje), Fort Johnston (near the
  outlet of the river Shiré from the south end of Lake Nyasa), Kotakota and
  Bandawe (on the west coast of Lake Nyasa), Likoma (on an island off the
  east coast of Lake Nyasa), Karonga (on the north-west coast of Lake
  Nyasa), Fife (on the Nyasa-Tanganyika plateau), Fort Jameson (capital of
  N.E. Rhodesia, near the river Luangwa), Abercorn (on the south end of
  Lake Tanganyika), Kalungwisi (on the east coast of Lake Mweru) and Fort
  Rosebery (near the Johnston Falls on the Luapula [upper Congo]).</p>

  <p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;The present political divisions of the
  country are as follows:&mdash;The Nyasaland Protectorate, <i>i.e.</i> the
  districts surrounding Lake Nyasa and the Shiré province, are administered
  directly under the imperial government by a governor, who acts under the
  orders of the colonial office. The governor is assisted by an executive
  council and by a nominated legislative council, which consists of at
  least three members. The districts to the westward, forming the provinces
  of North Eastern and North Western Rhodesia, are governed by two
  administrators of the British South Africa Chartered Company, in
  consultation with the governor of Nyasaland and the colonial office.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of the territory dealt with above is
  recent and slight. Apart from the vague Portuguese wanderings during the
  16th and 17th centuries, the first European explorer of any education who
  penetrated into this country was the celebrated Portuguese official, Dr
  F.J.M. de Lacerda e Almeida, who journeyed from Tete on the Zambezi to
  the vicinity of Lake Mweru. But the real history of the country begins
  with the advent of David Livingstone, who in 1859 penetrated up the Shiré
  river and discovered Lake Nyasa. Livingstone's subsequent journeys, to
  the south end of Tanganyika, to Lake Mweru and to Lake Bangweulu (where
  he died in 1873), opened up this important part of South Central Africa
  and centred in it British interests in a very particular manner.
  Livingstone's death was soon followed by the entry of various missionary
  societies, who commenced the evangelization of the country; and these
  missionaries, together with a few Scottish settlers, steadily opposed the
  attempts of the Portuguese to extend their sway in this direction from
  the adjoining provinces of Moçambique and of the Zambezi. From out of the
  missionary societies grew a trading company, the African Lakes Trading
  Corporation. This body came into conflict with a number of Arabs who had
  established themselves on the north end of Lake Nyasa. About 1885 a
  struggle began between Arab and Briton for the possession of the country,
  which was not terminated until the year 1896. The African Lakes
  Corporation in its unofficial war enlisted volunteers, amongst whom were
  Captain (afterwards Sir F.D.) Lugard and Mr (afterwards Sir) Alfred
  Sharpe. Both these gentlemen were wounded, and the operations they
  undertook were not crowned with complete success. In 1889 Mr (afterwards
  Sir) H.H. Johnston was sent out to endeavour to effect a possible
  arrangement of the dispute between the Arabs and the African Lakes
  Corporation, and also to ensure the protection of friendly native chiefs
  from Portuguese aggression beyond a certain point. The outcome of these
  efforts and the treaties made was the creation of the British
  protectorate and sphere of influence north of the Zambezi (see <span
  class="sc">Africa</span>; § 5). In 1891 Johnston returned to the country
  as imperial commissioner and consul-general. In the interval between 1889
  and 1891 Mr Alfred Sharpe, on behalf of Cecil Rhodes, had brought a large
  part of the country into treaty with the British South Africa Company,
  These territories (Northern Rhodesia) were administered for four years by
  Sir Harry Johnston in connexion with the British Central Africa
  protectorate. Between 1891 and 1895 a long struggle continued, between
  the British authorities on the one hand and the Arabs and Mahommedan Yaos
  on the other, regarding the suppression of the slave trade. By the
  beginning of 1896 the last Arab stronghold was taken and the Yaos were
  completely reduced to submission. Then followed, during 1896-1898, wars
  with the Zulu (Angoni) tribes, who claimed to dominate and harass the
  native populations to the west of Lake Nyasa. The Angoni having been
  subdued, and the British South Africa Company having also quelled the
  turbulent Awemba and Bashukulumbwe, there is a reasonable hope of the
  country enjoying a settled peace and considerable prosperity. This
  prospect has been, indeed, already realized to a considerable extent,
  though the increase of commerce has scarcely been as rapid as was
  anticipated. In 1897, on the transference of Sir Harry Johnston to Tunis,
  the commissionership was conferred on Mr Alfred Sharpe, who was created a
  K.C.M.G. in 1903. In 1904 the administration of the protectorate,
  originally directed by the foreign office, was transferred to the
  colonial office. In 1907, on the change in the title of the protectorate,
  the designation of the chief official was altered from commissioner to
  governor, and executive and legislative councils were established. The
  mineral <!-- Page 598 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page598"></a>[v.04 p.0598]</span>surveys and railway construction
  commenced under the foreign office were carried on vigorously under the
  colonial office. The increased revenue, from £51,000 in 1901-1902 to
  £76,000 in 1905-1906, for the protectorate alone (see also <span
  class="sc">Rhodesia</span>), is an evidence of increasing prosperity.
  Expenditure in excess of revenue is met by grants in aid from the
  imperial exchequer, so far as the Nyasaland Protectorate is concerned.
  The British South Africa Company finances the remainder. The native
  population is well disposed towards European rule, having, indeed, at all
  times furnished the principal contingent of the armed force with which
  the African Lakes Company, British South Africa Company or the British
  government endeavoured to oppose Arab, Zulu or Awemba aggression. The
  protectorate government maintains three gunboats on Lake Nyasa, and the
  British South Africa Company an armed steamer on Lake Tanganyika.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, though so rich and fertile, the land is not as a rule
  very healthy for Europeans, though there are signs of improvement in this
  respect. The principal scourges are black-water fever and dysentery,
  besides ordinary malarial fever, malarial ulcers, pneumonia and
  bronchitis. The climate is agreeable, and except in the low-lying
  districts is never unbearably hot; while on the high mountain plateaus
  frost frequently occurs during the dry season.</p>

  <p><b>BRITISH COLUMBIA,</b> the western province of the Dominion of
  Canada. It is bounded on the east by the continental watershed in the
  Rocky Mountains, until this, in its north-westerly course, intersects
  120° W., which is followed north to 60° N., thus including within the
  province a part of the Peace river country to the east of the mountains.
  The southern boundary is formed by 49° N. and the strait separating
  Vancouver Island from the state of Washington. The northern boundary is
  60° N., the western the Pacific Ocean, upon which the province fronts for
  about 600 m., and the coast strip of Alaska for a further distance of 400
  m. Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands, as well as the
  smaller islands lying off the western coast of Canada, belong to the
  province of British Columbia.</p>

  <p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;British Columbia is essentially a
  mountainous country, for the Rocky Mountains which in the United States
  lie to the east of the Great Basin, on running to the north bear toward
  the west and approach the ranges which border the Pacific coast. Thus
  British Columbia comprises practically the entire width of what has been
  termed the Cordillera or Cordilleran belt of North America, between the
  parallels of latitude above indicated. There are two ruling mountain
  systems in this belt&mdash;the Rocky Mountains proper on the north-east
  side, and the Coast Range on the south-west or Pacific side. Between
  these are subordinate ranges to which various local names have been
  given, as well as the "Interior Plateau"&mdash;an elevated tract of hilly
  country, the hill summits having an accordant altitude, which lies to the
  east of the Coast Range. The several ranges, having been produced by
  successive foldings of the earth's crust in a direction parallel to the
  border of the Pacific Ocean, have a common trend which is south-east and
  north-west. Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands are remnants
  of still another mountain range, which runs parallel to the coast but is
  now almost entirely submerged beneath the waters of the Pacific. The
  province might be said to consist of a series of parallel mountain ranges
  with long narrow valleys lying between them.</p>

  <p>The Rocky Mountains are composed chiefly of palaeozoic sediments
  ranging in age from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous, with subordinate
  infolded areas of Cretaceous which hold coal. The average height of the
  range along the United States boundary is 8000 ft., but the range
  culminates between the latitudes of 51° and 53°, the highest peak in the
  Canadian Rockies being Mount Robson, 13,700 ft., although the highest
  peak in British Columbia is Mount Fairweather on the International
  Boundary, which rises to 15,287 ft. Other high peaks in the Rocky
  Mountains of Canada are Columbia, 12,740 ft.; Forbes, 12,075;
  Assiniboine, 11,860; Bryce. 11,686; Temple, 11,626; Lyell, 11,463. There
  are a number of passes over the Rocky Mountains, among which may be
  mentioned, beginning from the south, the South Kootenay or Boundary Pass,
  7100 ft.; the Crow's Nest Pass, 5500 (this is traversed by the southern
  branch of the Canadian Pacific railway and crosses great coal fields);
  the Kicking Horse or Wapta Pass, 5300 (which is traversed by the main
  line of the Canadian Pacific railway); the Athabasca Pass, 6025; the
  Yellow Head Pass, 3733 (which will probably be used by the Grand Trunk
  Pacific railway); the Pine River Pass, 2850; and the Peace River Pass,
  2000, through which the Peace river flows.</p>

  <p>The Coast Range, sometimes called the Cascade Range, borders the
  Pacific coast for 900 m. and gives to it its remarkable character. To its
  partially submerged transverse valleys are due the excellent harbours on
  the coast, the deep sounds and inlets which penetrate far inland at many
  points, as well as the profound and gloomy fjords and the stupendous
  precipices which render the coast line an exaggerated reproduction of
  that of Norway. The coast is, in fact, one of the most remarkable in the
  world, measuring with all its indentations 7000 m. in the aggregate, and
  being fringed with an archipelago of innumerable islands, of which
  Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands are the largest.</p>

  <p>Along the south-western side of the Rocky Mountains is a very
  remarkable valley of considerable geological antiquity, in which some
  seven of the great rivers of the Pacific slope, among them the Kootenay,
  Columbia, Fraser and Finlay, flow for portions of their upper courses.
  This valley, which is from 1 to 6 m. in width, can be traced continuously
  for a length of at least 800 m. One of the most important rivers of the
  province is the Fraser, which, rising in the Rocky Mountains, flows for a
  long distance to the north-west, and then turning south eventually
  crosses the Coast Range by a deep canton-like valley and empties into the
  Strait of Georgia, a few miles south of the city of Vancouver. The
  Columbia, which rises farther south in the same range, flows north for
  about 150 m., crossing the main line of the Canadian Pacific railway at
  Donald, and then bending abruptly back upon its former course, flows
  south, recrossing the Canadian Pacific railway at Revelstoke, and on
  through the Arrow Lakes in the Kootenay country into the United States,
  emptying into the Pacific Ocean at Astoria in the state of Oregon. These
  lakes, as well as the other large lakes in southern British Columbia,
  remain open throughout the winter. In the north-western part of the
  province the Skeena flows south-west into the Pacific, and still farther
  to the north the Stikine rises in British Columbia, but before entering
  the Pacific crosses the coast strip of Alaska. The Liard, rising in the
  same district, flows east and falls into the Mackenzie, which empties
  into the Arctic Ocean. The headwaters of the Yukon are also situated in
  the northern part of the province. All these rivers are swift and are
  frequently interrupted by rapids, so that, as means of communication for
  commercial purposes, they are of indifferent value. Wherever lines of
  railway are constructed, they lose whatever importance they may have held
  in this respect previously.</p>

  <p>At an early stage in the Glacial period British Columbia was covered
  by the Cordilleran glacier, which moved south-eastwards and
  north-westwards, in correspondence with the ruling features of the
  country, from a gathering-ground situated in the vicinity of the 57th
  parallel. Ice from this glacier poured through passes in the coast
  ranges, and to a lesser extent debouched upon the edge of the great
  plains, beyond the Rocky Mountain range. The great valley between the
  coast ranges and Vancouver Island was also occupied by a glacier that
  moved in both directions from a central point in the vicinity of Valdez
  Island. The effects of this glacial action and of the long periods of
  erosion preceding it and of other physiographic changes connected with
  its passing away, have most important bearings on the distribution and
  character of the gold-bearing alluviums of the province.</p>

  <p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The subjoined figures relating to temperature
  and precipitation are from a table prepared by Mr R.F. Stupart, director
  of the meteorological service. The station at Victoria may be taken as
  representing the conditions of the southern part of the coast of British
  Columbia, although the rainfall is much greater on exposed parts of the
  outer coast. Agassiz represents the Fraser delta and Kamloops the
  southern interior district. The mean temperature naturally decreases to
  the northward of these selected stations, both along the coast and in the
  interior, while the precipitation increases. The figures given for Port
  Simpson are of interest, as the Pacific terminus of the Grand Trunk
  Pacific railway will be in this vicinity.</p>

  <p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;Among the larger mammals are the big-horn or
  mountain sheep (<i>Ovis canadensis</i>), the Rocky Mountain goat
  (<i>Mazama montana</i>), the grizzly bear, moose, woodland caribou,
  black-tailed or mule deer, white-tailed deer, and coyote. All these are
  to be found only on the mainland. The black bear, wolf, puma, lynx,
  wapiti, and Columbian or coast deer are common to parts of both mainland
  and islands. Of marine mammals the most characteristic are the sea-lion,
  fur-seal, sea-otter and harbour-seal. About 340 species of birds are
  known to occur in the province, among which, as of special interest, may
  be mentioned the burrowing owl of the dry, interior region, the <!-- Page
  599 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page599"></a>[v.04
  p.0599]</span>American magpie, Steller's jay and a true nut-cracker,
  Clark's crow (<i>Picicorvus columbianus</i>). True jays and orioles are
  also well represented. The gallinaceous birds include the large blue
  grouse of the coast, replaced in the Rocky Mountains by the dusky grouse.
  The western form of the "spruce partridge" of eastern Canada is also
  abundant, together with several forms referred to the genus
  <i>Bonasa</i>, generally known as "partridges" or ruffed grouse.
  Ptarmigans also abound in many of the higher mountain regions. Of the
  <i>Anatidae</i> only passing mention need be made. During the spring and
  autumn migrations many species are found in great abundance, but in the
  summer a smaller number remain to breed, chief among which are the teal,
  mallard, wood-duck, spoon-bill, pin-tail, buffle-head, red-head,
  canvas-back, scaup-duck, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Area and Population.</i>&mdash;The area of British Columbia is
  357,600 sq. m., and its population by the census of 1901 was 190,000.
  Since that date this has been largely increased by the influx of miners
  and others, consequent upon the discovery of precious metals in the
  Kootenay, Boundary and Atlin districts. Much of this is a floating
  population, but the opening up of the valleys by railway and new lines of
  steamboats, together with the settlements made in the vicinity of the
  Canadian Pacific railway, has resulted in a considerable increase of the
  permanent population. The white population comprises men of many
  nationalities. There is a large Chinese population, the census of 1901
  returning 14,201. The influx of Chinamen has, however, practically
  ceased, owing to the tax of $500 per head imposed by the government of
  the dominion. Many Japanese have also come in. The Japanese are engaged
  chiefly in lumbering and fishing, but the Chinese are found everywhere in
  the province. Great objection is taken by the white population to the
  increasing number of "Mongolians," owing to their competition with whites
  in the labour markets. The Japanese do not appear to be so much disliked,
  as they adapt themselves to the ways of white men, but they are equally
  objected to on the score of cheap labour; and in 1907-1908 considerable
  friction occurred with the Dominion government over the Anti-Japanese
  attitude of British Columbia, which was shown in some rather serious
  riots. In the census of 1901 the Indian population is returned at 25,488;
  of these 20,351 are professing Christians and 5137 are pagans. The
  Indians are divided into very many tribes, under local names, but fall
  naturally on linguistic grounds into a few large groups. Thus the
  southern part of the interior is occupied by the Salish and Kootenay, and
  the northern interior by the Tinneh or Athapackan people. On the coast
  are the Haida, Tsimshian, Kwakiatl, Nootka, and about the Gulf of Georgia
  various tribes related to the Salish proper. There is no treaty with the
  Indians of British Columbia, as with those of the plains, for the
  relinquishment of their title to the land, but the government otherwise
  assists them. There is an Indian superintendent at Victoria, and under
  him are nine agencies throughout the province to attend to the
  Indians&mdash;relieving their sick and destitute, supplying them with
  seed and implements, settling their disputes and administering justice.
  The Indian fishing stations and burial grounds are reserved, and other
  land has been set apart for them for agricultural and pastoral purposes.
  A number of schools have been established for their education. They were
  at one time a dangerous element, but are now quiet and peaceable.</p>

  <p>The chief cities are Victoria, the capital, on Vancouver Island; and
  Vancouver on the mainland, New Westminster on the Fraser and Nanaimo on
  Vancouver Island. Rossland and Nelson in West Kootenay, as well as Fernie
  in East Kootenay and Grand Forks in the Boundary district, are also
  places of importance.</p>

  <p><i>Mining.</i>&mdash;Mining is the principal industry of British
  Columbia. The country is rich in gold, silver, copper, lead and coal, and
  has also iron deposits. From 1894 to 1904 the mining output increased
  from $4,225,717 to $18,977,359. In 1905 it had reached $22,460,295. The
  principal minerals, in order of value of output, are gold, copper, coal,
  lead and silver. Between 1858&mdash;the year of the placer discoveries on
  the Fraser river and in the Cariboo district&mdash;and 1882, the placer
  yields were much heavier than in subsequent years, running from one to
  nearly four million dollars annually, but there was no quartz mining.
  Since 1899 placer mining has increased considerably, although the greater
  part of the return has been from lode mining. The Rossland, the Boundary
  and the Kootenay districts are the chief centres of vein-mining, yielding
  auriferous and cupriferous sulphide ores, as well as large quantities of
  silver-bearing lead ores. Ores of copper and the precious metals are
  being prospected and worked also, in several places along the coast and
  on Vancouver Island. The mining laws are liberal, and being based on the
  experience gained in the adjacent mining centres of the Western States,
  are convenient and effective. The most important smelting and reducing
  plants are those at Trail and Nelson in the West Kootenay country, and at
  Grand Forks and Greenwood in the Boundary district. There are also
  numerous concentrating plants. Mining machinery of the most modern types
  is employed wherever machinery is required.</p>

  <p>The province contains enormous supplies of excellent coal, most of
  which are as yet untouched. It is chiefly of Cretaceous age. The
  producing collieries are chiefly on Vancouver Island and on the western
  slope of the Rockies near the Crow's Nest Pass in the extreme
  south-eastern portion of the provinces. Immense beds of high grade
  bituminous coal and semi-anthracite are exposed in the Bulkley Valley,
  south of the Skeena river, not far from the projected line of the Grand
  Trunk Pacific railway. About one-half the coal mined is exported to the
  United States.</p>

  <p><i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;A large percentage of the commerce is derived
  from the sea, the chief product being salmon. Halibut, cod (several
  varieties), oolachan, sturgeon, herring, shad and many other fishes are
  also plentiful, but with the exception of the halibut these have not yet
  become the objects of extensive industries. There are several kinds of
  salmon, and they run in British Columbia waters at different seasons of
  the year. The quinnat or spring salmon is the largest and best table
  fish, and is followed in the latter part of the summer by the sockeye,
  which runs in enormous numbers up the Fraser and Skeena rivers. This is
  the fish preferred for canning. It is of brighter colour, more uniform in
  size, and comes in such quantities that a constant supply can be reckoned
  upon by the canneries. About the mouth of the Fraser river from 1800 to
  2600 boats are occupied during the run. There is an especially large run
  of sockeye salmon in the Fraser river every fourth year, while in the
  year immediately following there is a poor run. The silver salmon or
  cohoe arrives a little later than the sockeye, but is not much used for
  packing except when required to make up deficiencies. The dog-salmon is
  not canned, but large numbers are caught by the Japanese, who salt them
  for export to the Orient. The other varieties are of but little
  commercial importance at present, although with the increasing demand for
  British Columbia salmon, the fishing season is being extended to cover
  the runs of all the varieties of this fish found in the waters of the
  province.</p>

  <p>Great Britain is the largest but not the only market for British
  Columbia salmon. The years vary in productiveness, 1901 having been
  unusually large and 1903 the smallest in eleven years, but the average
  pack is about 700,000 cases of forty-eight 1-lb tins, the greater part of
  all returns being from the Fraser river canneries, the Skeena river and
  the Rivers Inlet coming next in order. There are between 60 and 70
  canneries, of which about 40 are on the banks of <!-- Page 600 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page600"></a>[v.04 p.0600]</span>the Fraser
  river. There is urgent need for the enactment of laws restricting the
  catch of salmon, as the industry is now seriously threatened. The fish
  oils are extracted chiefly from several species of dog-fish, and
  sometimes from the basking shark, as well as from the oolachan, which is
  also an edible fish.</p>

  <p>The fur-seal fishery is an important industry, though apparently a
  declining one. Owing to the scarcity of seals and international
  difficulties concerning pelagic sealing in Bering Sea, where the greatest
  number have been taken, the business of seal-hunting is losing favour.
  Salmon fish-hatcheries have been established on the chief rivers
  frequented by these fish. Oysters and lobsters from the Atlantic coast
  have been planted in British Columbia waters.</p>

  <p><i>Timber.</i>&mdash;The province is rich in forest growth, and there
  is a steady demand for its lumber in the other parts of Canada as well as
  in South America, Africa, Australia and China. The following is a list of
  some of the more important trees&mdash;large leaved maple (<i>Acer
  macrophyllum</i>), red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>), western larch
  (<i>Larix occidentalis</i>), white spruce (<i>Picea alba</i>),
  Engellmann's spruce (<i>Picea Engelmanii</i>), Menzies's spruce (<i>Picea
  sitchensis</i>), white mountain pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>), black pine
  (<i>Pinus murrayana</i>), yellow pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>), Douglas
  fir (<i>Pseudotsuga Douglasii</i>), western white oak (<i>Quercus
  garryana</i>), giant cedar (<i>Thuya gigantea</i>), yellow cypress or
  cedar (<i>Thuya excelsa</i>), western hemlock (<i>Tsuga mertensiana</i>).
  The principal timber of commerce is the Douglas fir. The tree is often
  found 300 ft. high and from 8 to 10ft. in diameter. The wood is tough and
  strong and highly valued for ships' spars as well as for building
  purposes. Red or giant cedar, which rivals the Douglas fir in girth, is
  plentiful, and is used for shingles as well as for interior work. The
  western white spruce is also much employed for various purposes. There
  are about eighty sawmills, large and small, in the province. The amount
  of timber cut on Dominion government lands in 1904 was 22,760,222 ft.,
  and the amount cut on provincial lands was 325,271,568 ft., giving a
  total of 348,031,790 ft. In 1905 the cut on dominion lands exceeded that
  in 1904, while the amount cut on provincial lands reached 450,385,554 ft.
  The cargo shipments of lumber for the years 1904 and 1905 were as

  <p>There is a very large market for British Columbia lumber in the
  western provinces of Canada.</p>

  <p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;Although mountainous in character the
  province contains many tracts of good farming land. These lie in the long
  valleys between the mountain ranges of the interior, as well as on the
  lower slopes of the mountains and on the deltas of the rivers running out
  to the coast. On Vancouver Island also there is much good farming land.
  The conditions are in most places best suited to mixed farming; the chief
  crops raised are wheat, oats, potatoes and hay. Some areas are especially
  suited for cattle and sheep raising, among which may be mentioned the
  Yale district and the country about Kamloops. Much attention has been
  given to fruit raising, especially in the Okanagan valley. Apples, plums
  and cherries are grown, as well as peaches, apricots, grapes and various
  small fruits, notably strawberries. All these are of excellent quality.
  Hops are also cultivated. A large market for this fruit is opening up in
  the rapidly growing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>

  <p><i>Imports and Exports.</i>&mdash;For the year ending June 30th 1905
  the total exports and imports (showing a slight gradual increase on the
  two preceding years) were valued at $16,677,882 and $12,565,019
  respectively. The exports were classified as follows:&mdash;Mines,
  $9,777,423; fisheries, $2,101,533; forests, $1,046,718; animals,
  $471,231; agriculture, $119,426; manufactures, $1,883,777; miscellaneous,
  $1,106,643; coin and bullion, $171,131.</p>

  <p><i>Railways.</i>&mdash;The Pacific division of the Canadian Pacific
  railway enters British Columbia through the Rocky Mountains on the east
  and runs for about 500 m. across the province before reaching the
  terminus at Vancouver. A branch of the same railway leaves the main line
  at Medicine Hat, and running to the south-west, crosses the Rocky
  Mountains through the Crow's Nest Pass, and thus enters British Columbia
  a short distance north of the United States boundary. This continues
  across the province, running approximately parallel to the boundary as
  far as Midway in what is known as the Boundary district. The line has
  opened up extensive coal fields and crosses a productive mining district.
  On Vancouver Island there are two railways, the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo
  railway (78 m.) connecting the coal fields with the southern ports, and
  the Victoria &amp; Sydney railway, about 16 m. in length. The Great
  Northern has also a number of short lines in the southern portion of the
  province, connecting with its system in the United States. In 1905 there
  were 1627m. of railway in the province, of which 1187 were owned or
  controlled by the Canadian Pacific railway.</p>

  <p><i>Shipping.</i>&mdash;The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has two
  lines of mail steamer running from Vancouver and Victoria: (l) the
  Empress line, which runs to Japan and China once in three weeks, and (2)
  the Australian line to Honolulu, Fiji and Sydney, once a month. The same
  company also has a line of steamers running to Alaska, as well as a fleet
  of coasting steamers.</p>

  <p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;The province is governed by a
  lieutenant-governor, appointed by the governor-general in council for
  five years, but subject to removal for cause, an executive council of
  five ministers, and a single legislative chamber. The executive council
  is appointed by the lieutenant-governor on the advice of the first
  minister, and retains office so long as it enjoys the support of a
  majority of the legislature. The powers of the lieutenant-governor in
  regard to the provincial government are analogous to those of
  governor-general in respect of the dominion government.</p>

  <p>The British North America Act (1867) confederating the colonies,
  defines the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature as distinguished
  from that of the federal parliament, but within its own jurisdiction the
  province makes the laws for its own governance. The act of the
  legislature may be disallowed, within one year of its passage, by the
  governor-general in council, and is also subject to challenge as to its
  legality in the supreme court of Canada or on appeal to the juridical
  committee of the privy council of the United Kingdom. British Columbia
  sends three senators and seven members to the lower house of the federal
  parliament, which sits at Ottawa.</p>

  <p><i>Justice.</i>&mdash;There is a supreme court of British Columbia
  presided over by a chief justice and five puisne judges, and there are
  also a number of county courts. In British Columbia the supreme court has
  jurisdiction in divorce cases, this right having been invested in the
  colony before confederation.</p>

  <p><i>Religion and Education.</i>&mdash;In 1901 the population was
  divided by creeds as follows: Church of England, 40,687; Methodist,
  25,047; Presbyterian, 34,081; Roman Catholic, 33,639; others, 40,197; not
  stated, 5003; total, 178,654. The educational system of British Columbia
  differs slightly from that of other provinces of Canada. There are three
  classes of schools&mdash;common, graded and high&mdash;all maintained by
  the government and all free and undenominational. There is only one
  college in the province, the "McGill University College of British
  Columbia" at Vancouver, which is one of the colleges of McGill
  University, whose chief seat is at Montreal. The schools are controlled
  by trustees selected by the ratepayers of each school district, and there
  is a superintendent of education acting under the provincial
  secretary.</p>

  <p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;Under the terms of union with Canada, British
  Columbia receives from the dominion government annually a certain
  contribution, which in 1905 amounted to $307,076. This, with provincial
  taxes on real property, personal property, income tax, sales of public
  land, timber dues, &amp;c., amounted in the year 1905 to $2,920,461. The
  expenditure for the year was $2,302,417. The gross debt of the province
  in 1905 was $13,252,097, with assets of $4,463,869, or a net debt of
  $8,788,228. These assets do not include new legislative buildings or
  other public works. The income tax is on a sliding scale. In 1899 a
  fairly close estimate was made of the capital invested in the province,
  which amounted to $307,385,000 including timber, $100,000,000; railways
  and telegraphs, $47,500,000; mining plant and smelters, $10,500,000;
  municipal assessments, $45,000,000; provincial assessments, $51,500,000;
  in addition to private wealth, $280,000,000. There are branch offices of
  one or more of the Canadian banks in each of the larger towns.</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The discovery of British Columbia was made by
  the Spaniard Perez in 1774. With Cook's visit the geographical
  exploration of the coast began in 1778. Vancouver, in 1792-1794, surveyed
  almost the entire coast of British Columbia with much of that to the
  north and south, for the British government. The interior, about the same
  time, was entered by Mackenzie and traders of the N.W. Company, which in
  1821 became amalgamated with the Hudson's Bay Company. For the next
  twenty-eight years the Hudson's Bay Company ruled this immense territory
  with beneficent despotism. In 1849 Vancouver Island was proclaimed a
  British colony. In 1858, consequent on the discovery of gold and the
  large influx of miners, the mainland territory was erected into a colony
  under the name of British Columbia, and in 1866 this was united with the
  colony of Vancouver Island, under the same name. In 1871 British Columbia
  entered the confederation and became part of the Dominion of Canada,
  sending three senators and six (now seven) members to the House of
  Commons of the federal parliament. One of the conditions under which the
  colony entered the dominion was the speedy construction of the Canadian
  Pacific railway, and in 1876 the non-fulfilment of this promise and the
  apparent indifference of the government at Ottawa to the representations
  of British Columbia created <!-- Page 601 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page601"></a>[v.04 p.0601]</span>strained relations, which were
  only ameliorated when the construction of a transcontinental road was
  begun. In subsequent years the founding of the city of Vancouver by the
  C.P.R., the establishment of the first Canadian steamship line to China
  and Japan, and that to Australia, together with the disputes with the
  United States on the subject of pelagic sealing, and the discovery of the
  Kootenay and Boundary mining districts, have been the chief events in the
  history of the province.</p>

  <p><b>BRITISH EAST AFRICA,</b> a term, in its widest sense, including all
  the territory under British influence on the eastern side of Africa
  between German East Africa on the south and Abyssinia and the
  Anglo-Egyptian Sudan on the north. It comprises the protectorates of
  Zanzibar, Uganda and East Africa. Apart from a narrow belt of coastland,
  the continental area belongs almost entirely to the great plateau of East
  Africa, rarely falling below an elevation of 2000 ft., while extensive
  sections rise to a height of 6000 to 8000 ft. From the coast lowlands a
  series of steps with intervening plateaus leads to a broad zone of high
  ground remarkable for the abundant traces of volcanic action. This broad
  upland is furrowed by the eastern "rift-valley," formed by the subsidence
  of its floor and occupied in parts by lakes without outlet. Towards the
  west a basin of lower elevation is partially occupied by Victoria Nyanza,
  drained north to the Nile, while still farther inland the ground again
  rises to a second volcanic belt, culminating in the Ruwenzori range. (See
  <span class="sc">Zanzibar</span>, and for Uganda protectorate see <span
  class="sc">Uganda</span>.) The present article treats of the East Africa
  protectorate only.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/zbritisheastafrica_1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/britisheastafrica_1.png"
      alt="British East Africa." title="British East Africa." /></a>
  </div>
  <p><i>Topography.</i>&mdash;The southern frontier, coterminous with the
  northern frontier of German East Africa, runs north-west from the mouth
  of the Umba river in 4° 40&prime; S. to Victoria Nyanza, which it strikes
  at 1° S., deviating, however, so as to leave Mount Kilimanjaro wholly in
  German territory. The eastern boundary is the Indian Ocean, the coast
  line being about 400 m. On the north the protectorate is bounded by
  Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland; on the west by Uganda. It has an area
  of about 240,000 sq. m., and a population estimated at from 2,000,000 to
  4,000,000, including some 25,000 Indians and 3000 Europeans. Of the
  Europeans many are emigrants from South Africa; they include some
  hundreds of Boer families.</p>

  <p>The first of the parallel zones&mdash;the coast plain or
  "Temborari"&mdash;is generally of insignificant width, varying from 2 to
  10 m., except in the valleys of the main rivers. The shore line is broken
  by bays and branching creeks, often cutting off islands from the
  mainland. Such are Mvita or Mombasa in 4° 4&prime; S., and the larger
  islands of Lamu, Manda and Patta (the Lamu archipelago), between 2°
  20&prime; and 2° S. Farther north the coast becomes straighter, with the
  one indentation of Port Durnford in 1° 10&prime; S., but skirted seawards
  by a row of small islands. Beyond the coast plain the country rises in a
  generally well defined step or steps to an altitude of some 800 ft.,
  forming the wide level plain called "Nyika" (uplands), largely composed
  of quartz. It contains large waterless areas, such as the Taru desert in
  the Mombasa district. The next stage in the ascent is marked by an
  intermittent line of mountains&mdash;gneissose or schistose&mdash;running
  generally north-north-west, sometimes in parallel chains, and
  representing the primitive axis of the continent. Their height varies
  from 5000 to 8000 ft. Farther inland grassy uplands extend to the eastern
  edge of the rift-valley, though varied with cultivated ground and forest,
  the former especially in Kikuyu, the latter between 0° and 0° 40&prime;
  S. The most extensive grassy plains are those of Kapte or Kapote and
  Athi, between 1° and 2° S. The general altitude of these uplands, the
  surface of which is largely composed of lava, varies from 5000 to 8000
  ft. This zone contains the highest elevations in British East Africa,
  including the volcanic pile of Kenya (<i>q.v.</i>) (17,007 ft.), Sattima
  (13,214 ft.) and Nandarua (about 12,900 ft.). The Sattima (Settima)
  range, or Aberdare Mountains, has a general elevation of fully 10,000 ft.
  To the west the fall to the rift-valley is marked by a line of cliffs, of
  which the best-defined portions are the Kikuyu escarpment (8000 ft.),
  just south of 1° S., and the Laikipia escarpment, on the equator. One of
  the main watersheds of East Africa runs close to the eastern wall of the
  rift-valley, separating the basins of inland drainage from the rivers of
  the east coast, of which the two largest wholly within British East
  Africa are the Sabaki and Tana, both separately noticed. The Guaso Nyiro
  rises in the hills north-west of Kenya and flows in a north-east
  direction. After a course of over 350 m. the river in about 1° N., 39°
  30&prime; E. is lost in a marshy expanse known as the Lorian Swamp.</p>

  <p>The rift-valley, though with a generally level floor, is divided by
  transverse ridges into a series of basins, each containing a lake without
  outlet. The southernmost section within British East Africa is formed by
  the arid Dogilani plains, drained south towards German territory. At
  their north end rise the extinct volcanoes of Suswa (7800 ft.) and
  Longonot (8700), the latter on the ridge dividing off the next
  basin&mdash;that of Lake Naivasha. This is a small fresh-water lake, 6135
  ft. above the sea, measuring some 13 m each way. Its basin is closed to
  the north by the ridge of Mount Buru, beyond which is the basin of the
  <!-- Page 602 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page602"></a>[v.04
  p.0602]</span>still smaller Lakes Nakuro (5845 ft.) and Elmenteita (5860
  ft.), followed in turn by that of Lakes Hannington and Baringo
  (<i>q.v.</i>). Beyond Baringo the valley is drained north into Lake
  Sugota, in 2° N., some 35 m. long, while north of this lies the much
  larger Lake Rudolf (<i>q.v.</i>), the valley becoming here somewhat less
  defined.</p>

  <p>On the west of the rift-valley the wall of cliffs is best marked
  between the equator and 1° S., where it is known as the Mau Escarpment,
  and about 1° N., where the Elgeyo Escarpment falls to a longitudinal
  valley separated from Lake Baringo by the ridge of Kamasia. Opposite Lake
  Naivasha the Mau Escarpment is over 8000 ft. high. Its crest is covered
  with a vast forest. To the south the woods become more open, and the
  plateau falls to an open country drained towards the Dogilani plains. On
  the west the cultivated districts of Sotik and Lumbwa, broken by wooded
  heights, fall towards Victoria Nyanza. The Mau plateau reaches a height
  of 9000 ft. on the equator, north of which is the somewhat lower Nandi
  country, well watered and partly forested. In the treeless plateau of
  Uasin Gishu, west of Elgeyo, the land again rises to a height of over
  8000 ft., and to the west of this is the great mountain mass of Elgon
  (<i>q.v.</i>). East of Lake Rudolf and south of Lake Stefanie is a large
  waterless steppe, mainly volcanic in character, from which rise mountain
  ranges. The highest peak is Mount Kanjora, 6900 ft. high. South of this
  arid region, strewn with great lava stones, are the Rendile uplands,
  affording pasturage for thousands of camels. Running north-west and
  south-east between Lake Stefanie and the Daua tributary of the Juba is a
  mountain range with a steep escarpment towards the south. It is known as
  the Goro Escarpment, and at its eastern end it forms the boundary between
  the protectorate and Abyssinia. South-east of it the country is largely
  level bush covered plain, mainly waterless.</p>

  <p>[<i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The geological formations of British East
  Africa occur in four regions possessing distinct physiographical
  features. The coast plain, narrow in the south and rising somewhat
  steeply, consists of recent rocks. The foot plateau which succeeds is
  composed of sedimentary rocks dating from Trias to Jurassic. The ancient
  plateau commencing at Taru extends to the borders of Kikuyu and is
  composed of ancient crystalline rocks on which immense quantities of
  volcanic rocks&mdash;post-Jurassic to Recent&mdash;have accumulated to
  form the volcanic plateau of Central East Africa.</p>

  <p>The formations recognized are given in the following table:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Archaean.</i>&mdash;These rocks prevail in the districts of Taru,
  Nandi and throughout Ukamba. A course gneiss is the predominant rock, but
  is associated with garnetiferous mica-schists and much intrusive granite.
  Hornblende schists and beds of metamorphic limestone are rare. Cherty
  quartzites interbedded with mylonites occur on the flanks of the Nandi
  hills, but their age is not known.</p>

  <p><i>Carboniferous?</i>&mdash;From shales on the Sabaki river Dr Gregory
  obtained fish-scales and specimens of <i>Palaeanodonta Fischeri.</i></p>

  <p><i>Karroo.</i>&mdash;The grits of Masara, near Rabai mission station
  and Mombasa, have yielded specimens of <i>Glossopteris browniana</i> var.
  <i>indica</i>, thus indicating their Karroo age.</p>

  <p><i>Jurassic.</i>&mdash;Shales and limestones of this age are well seen
  along the railway near Changamwe. They contain gigantic ammonites.
  According to Dr Waagen the ammonites show a striking analogy to forms
  from the Acanthicus zone of East India. Belemnites are plentiful.</p>

  <p><i>Pleistocene.</i>&mdash;These are feebly represented by some boulder
  beds on the higher slopes of Kilimanjaro and Kenya. They show that in
  Pleistocene times the glaciers of Kilimanjaro and Kenya extended much
  farther down the mountain slopes.</p>

  <p><i>Recent.</i>&mdash;The ancient and more modern lake deposits have so
  far yielded no mammalian or other organic remains of interest.</p>

  <p><i>Igneous and Volcanic.</i>&mdash;A belt of volcanic rocks, over
  150,000 sq. m. in area, extends from beyond the southern to beyond the
  northern territorial limits. They belong to an older and a newer set. The
  older group commenced with a series of fissure eruptions along the site
  of the present rift-valley and parallel with it. From these fissures
  immense and repeated flows of lava spread over the Kapte and Laikipia
  plateaus. At about the same time, or a little later, Kenya and Kimawenzi,
  Elgon and Chibcharagnani were in eruption. The age of these volcanic
  outbursts cannot be more definitely stated than that they are
  post-Jurassic, and probably extended through Cretaceous into early
  Tertiary times. This great volcanic period was followed by the eruptions
  of Kibo and some of the larger volcanoes of the rift-valley. The flows
  from Kibo include nepheline and leucite basanite lavas rich in soda
  felspars. They bear a close resemblance to the Norwegian
  "Rhombenporphyrs." The chain of volcanic cones along the northern lower
  slopes of Kilimanjaro, those of the Kyulu mountains, Donyo Longonot and
  numerous craters in the rift-valley region, are of a slightly more recent
  date. A few of the volcanoes in the latter region have only recently
  become extinct; a few may be only dormant. Donyo Buru still emits small
  quantities of steam, while Mount Teleki, in the neighbourhood of Lake
  Rudolf, was in eruption at the close of the 19th century.]</p>

  <p><i>Climate, Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;In its climate and vegetation
  British East Africa again shows an arrangement of zones parallel to the
  coast. The coast region is hot but is generally more healthy than the
  coast lands of other tropical countries, this being due to the constant
  <span class="correction" title="'beeeze' in original">breeze</span> from
  the Indian Ocean and to the dryness of the soil. The rainfall on the
  coast is about 35 in. a year, the temperature tropical. The succeeding
  plains and the outer plateaus are more arid. Farther inland the
  highlands&mdash;in which term may be included all districts over 5000 ft.
  high&mdash;are very healthy, fever being almost unknown. The average
  temperature is about 66° F. in the cool season and 73° F. in the hot
  season. Over 7000 ft. the climate becomes distinctly colder and frosts
  are experienced. The average rainfall in the highlands is between 40 and
  50 in. The country bordering Victoria Nyanza is typically tropical; the
  rainfall exceeds 60 in. in the year, and this region is quite unsuitable
  to Europeans. The hottest period throughout the protectorate is December
  to April, the coolest, July to September. The "greater rains" fall from
  March to June, the "smaller rains" in November and December. The rainfall
  is not, however, as regular as is usual in countries within the tropics,
  and severe droughts are occasionally experienced.</p>

  <p>In the districts bordering Victoria Nyanza the flora resembles that of
  Uganda (<i>q.v.</i>). The characteristic trees of the coast regions are
  the mangrove and coco-nut palm. Ebony grows in the scrub-jungle. Vast
  forests of olives and junipers are found on the Mau escarpment; the
  cotton, fig and bamboo on the Kikuyu escarpment; and in several regions
  are dense forests of great trees whose lowest branches are 50 ft. from
  the ground. Two varieties of the valuable rubber-vine, <i>Landolphia
  florida</i> and <i>Landolphia Kirkii</i>, are found near the coast and in
  the forests. The higher mountains preserve distinct species, the
  surviving remnants of the flora of a cooler period.</p>

  <p>The fauna is not abundant except in large mammals, which are very
  numerous on the drier steppes. They include the camel (confined to the
  arid northern regions), elephant (more and more restricted to
  unfrequented districts), rhinoceros, buffalo, many kinds of antelope,
  zebra, giraffe, hippopotamus, lion and other carnivora, and numerous
  monkeys. In many parts the rhinoceros is particularly abundant and
  dangerous. Crocodiles are common in the larger rivers and in Victoria
  Nyanza. Snakes are somewhat rare, the most dangerous being the
  puff-adder. Centipedes and scorpions, as well as mosquitoes and other
  insects, are also less common than in most tropical countries. In some
  districts bees are exceedingly numerous. The birds include the ostrich,
  stork, bustard and secretary-bird among the larger varieties, the guinea
  fowl, various kinds of spur fowl, and the lesser bustard, the wild
  pigeon, weaver and hornbill. By the banks of lakes and rivers are to be
  seen thousands of cranes, pelicans and flamingoes.</p>

  <p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The white population is chiefly in the
  Kikuyu uplands, the rift-valley, and in the Kenya region. The whites are
  mostly agriculturists. There are also numbers of Indian settlers in the
  same districts. The African races include representatives of various
  stocks, as the country forms a borderland between the Negro and Hamitic
  peoples, and contains many tribes of doubtful affinities. The Bantu
  division of the negroes is represented chiefly in the south, the
  principal tribes being the Wakamba, Wakikuyu and Wanyika. By the
  north-east shores of Victoria Nyanza dwell the Kavirondo (<i>q.v.</i>), a
  race remarkable among the tribes of the protectorate for their nudity.
  Nilotic tribes, including the Nandi (<i>q.v.</i>), Lumbwa, Suk and
  Turkana, are found in the north-west. Of Hamitic strain are the Masai
  (<i>q.v.</i>), a race of cattle-rearers speaking a Nilotic language, who
  occupy part of the uplands bordering on the eastern rift-valley. A branch
  of the Masai which has adopted the settled life of agriculturists is
  known as the Wakuafi. The Galla section of the Hamites is represented,
  among others, by Borani living <!-- Page 603 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page603"></a>[v.04 p.0603]</span>south of the Goro Escarpment
  (though the true Boran countries are Liban and Dirri in Abyssinian
  territory), while Somali occupy the country between the Tana and Juba
  rivers. Of the Somali tribes the Herti dwell near the coast and are more
  or less stationary. Further inland is the nomadic tribe of Ogaden Somali.
  The Gurre, another Somali tribe, occupy the country south of the lower
  Daua. Primitive hunting tribes are the Wandorobo in Masailand, and
  scattered tribes of small stature in various parts. The coast-land
  contains a mixed population of Swahili, Arab and Indian immigrants, and
  representatives of numerous interior tribes.</p>

  <p><i>Provinces and Towns.</i>&mdash;The protectorate has been divided
  into the provinces of Seyyidie (the south coast province, capital
  Mombasa); Ukamba, which occupies the centre of the protectorate (capital
  Nairobi); Kenya, the district of Mt. Kenya (capital Fort Hall); Tanaland,
  to the north of the two provinces first named (capital Lamu); Jubaland,
  the northern region (capital Kismayu); Naivasha (capital Naivasha); and
  Kisumu (capital Kisumu); each being in turn divided into districts and
  sub-districts. Naivasha and Kisumu, which adjoin the Victoria Nyanza,
  formed at first the eastern province of Uganda, but were transferred to
  the East Africa protectorate on the 1st of April 1902. The chief port of
  the protectorate is Mombasa (<i>q.v.</i>) with a population of about
  30,000. The harbour on the south-west side of Mombasa island is known as
  Kilindini, the terminus of the Uganda railway. On the mainland, nearly
  opposite Mombasa town, is the settlement of freed slaves named Freretown,
  after Sir Bartle Frere. Freretown (called by the natives Kisaoni) is the
  headquarters in East Africa of the Church Missionary Society. It is the
  residence of the bishop of the diocese of Mombasa and possesses a fine
  church and mission house. Lamu, on the island of the same name, 150 m.
  north-east of Mombasa, is an ancient settlement and the headquarters of
  the coast Arabs. Here are some Portuguese ruins, and a large Arab city is
  buried beneath the sands. The other towns of note on the coast are
  Malindi, Patta, Kipini and Kismayu. At Malindi, the "Melind" of
  <i>Paradise Lost</i>, is the pillar erected by Vasco da Gama when he
  visited the port in 1498. The harbour is very shallow. Kismayu, the
  northernmost port of the protectorate, 320 m. north-east of Mombasa, is
  the last sheltered anchorage on the east coast and is invaluable as a
  harbour of refuge. Flourishing towns have grown up along the Uganda
  railway. The most important, Nairobi (<i>q.v.</i>), 327 m. from Mombasa,
  257 from Port Florence, was chosen in 1907 as the administrative capital
  of the protectorate. Naivasha, 64 m. north-north-west of Nairobi, lies in
  the rift-valley close to Lake Naivasha, and is 6230 ft. above the sea. It
  enjoys an excellent climate and is the centre of a European agricultural
  settlement. Kisumu or Port Florence (a term confined to the harbour) is a
  flourishing town built on a hill overlooking Victoria Nyanza. It is the
  entrepôt for the trade of Uganda.</p>

  <p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Much has been done to open up the country
  by means of roads, including a trunk road from Mombasa, by Kibwezi in the
  upper Sabaki basin, and Lake Naivasha, to Berkeley Bay on Victoria
  Nyanza. But the most important engineering work undertaken in the
  protectorate was the construction of a railway from Mombasa to Victoria
  Nyanza, for which a preliminary survey was executed in 1892, and on which
  work was begun in 1896. The line chosen roughly coincides with that of
  the road, until the equator is reached, after which it strikes by a more
  direct route across the Mau plateau to the lake, which it reaches at Port
  Florence on Kavirondo Gulf. The railway is 584 m. long and is of metre
  (3.28 ft.) gauge, the Sudan, and South and Central African lines being of
  3 ft. 6 in. gauge. The Uganda railway is essentially a mountain line,
  with gradients of one in fifty and one in sixty. From Mombasa it crosses
  to the mainland by a bridge half a mile long, and ascends the plateau
  till it reaches the edge of the rift-valley, 346 m. from its starting
  point, at the Kikuyu Escarpment, where it is 7600 ft. above the sea. It
  then descends across ravines bridged by viaducts to the valley floor,
  dropping to a level of 6011 ft., and next ascending the opposite (Mau)
  escarpment to the summit, 8321 ft. above sea-level&mdash;the highest
  point on the line. In the remaining 100 m. of its course the level sinks
  to 3738 ft., the altitude of the station at Port Florence. The railway
  was built by the British government at a cost of £5,331,000, or about
  £9500 per mile. The first locomotive reached Victoria Nyanza on the 26th
  of December 1901; and the permanent way was practically completed by
  March 1903, when Sir George Whitehouse, the engineer who had been in
  charge of the construction from the beginning, resigned his post. The
  railway, by doing away with the carriage of goods by men, gave the final
  death-blow to the slave trade in that part of East Africa. It also
  facilitated the continued occupation and development of Uganda, which
  was, previous to its construction, an almost impossible task, owing to
  the prohibitive cost of the carriage of goods from the coast&mdash;£60
  per ton. The two avowed objects of the railway&mdash;the destruction of
  the slave trade and the securing of the British position in
  Uganda&mdash;have been attained; moreover, the railway by opening up land
  suitable for European settlement has also done much towards making a
  prosperous colony of the protectorate, which was regarded before the
  advent of the line as little better than a desert (see below,
  <i>History</i>). The railway also shows a fair return on the capital
  expenditure, the surplus after defraying all working expenses being
  £56,000 in 1905-1906 and £76,000 in 1906-1907.</p>

  <p>Mombasa is visited by the boats of several steamship companies, the
  German East Africa line maintaining a fortnightly service from Hamburg.
  There is also a regular service to and from India. A cable connecting
  Mombasa with Zanzibar puts the protectorate in direct telegraphic
  communication with the rest of the world. There is also an inland system
  of telegraphs connecting the chief towns with one another and with
  Uganda.</p>

  <p><i>Agriculture and other Industries.</i>&mdash;In the coast region and
  by the shores of Victoria Nyanza the products are tropical, and
  cultivation is mainly in the hands of the natives or of Indian
  immigrants. There are, however, numerous plantations owned by Europeans.
  Rice, maize and other grains are raised in large quantities; cotton and
  tobacco are cultivated. The coco-nut palm plantations yield copra of
  excellent quality, and the bark of the mangrove trees is exported for
  tanning purposes. In some inland districts beans of the castor oil plant,
  which grows in great abundance, are a lucrative article of trade. The
  sugar-cane, which grows freely in various places, is cultivated by the
  natives. The collection of rubber likewise employs numbers of people.</p>

  <p>Among the European settlers in the higher regions much attention is
  devoted to the production of vegetables, and very large crops of potatoes
  are raised. Oats, barley, wheat and coffee are also grown. The uplands
  are peculiarly adapted for the raising of stock, and many of the white
  settlers possess large flocks and herds. Merino sheep have been
  introduced from Australia. Ostrich farms have also been established.
  Clover, lucerne, ryegrass and similar grasses have been introduced to
  improve and vary the fodder. Other vegetable products of economic value
  are many varieties of timber trees, and fibre-producing plants, which are
  abundant in the scrub regions between the coast and the higher land
  bordering the rift-valley. Over the greater part of the country the soil
  is light reddish loam; in the eastern plains it is a heavy black loam. As
  a rule it is easily cultivated. While the majority of the African tribes
  in the territory are not averse from agricultural labour, the number of
  men available for work on European holdings is small. Moreover, on some
  of the land most suited for cultivation by white men there is no native
  population.</p>

  <p>In addition to the fibre industry and cotton ginning there are
  factories for the curing of bacon. Native industries include the weaving
  of cloth and the making of mats and baskets. Stone and lime quarries are
  worked, and copper is found in the Tsavo district. Diamonds have been
  discovered in the Thika river, one of the headstreams of the Tana.</p>

  <p><i>Trade.</i>&mdash;The imports consist largely of textiles, hardware
  and manufactured goods from India and Europe; Great Britain and India
  between them supplying over 50% of the total imports. Of other countries
  Germany has the leading share in the trade. The exports, which include
  the larger part of the external trade of Uganda, are chiefly copra, hides
  and skins, grains, potatoes, rubber, ivory, chillies, beeswax, cotton and
  fibre. The retail trade is largely in the hands of Indians. The value of
  the exports rose from £89,858 in 1900-1901 to £234,664 in 1904-1905, in
  which year the value of the imports for the first time exceeded £500,000.
  In 1906-1907 the volume of trade was £1,194,352, imports being valued at
  £753,647 and exports at £440,705. The United States takes 33% of the
  exports, Great Britain coming next with 15%.</p>

  <p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;The system of government resembles that of a
  British crown colony. At the head of the administration is a governor,
  who has a deputy styled lieutenant-governor, provincial commissioners
  presiding over each province. There are also executive and legislative
  councils, unofficial nominated members serving on the last-named council.
  In the "ten-mile strip" (see below, <i>History</i>), the sultan of
  Zanzibar being territorial sovereign, the laws of Islam apply to the
  native and Arab population. The extra-territorial jurisdiction granted by
  the sultan to various Powers was in 1907 transferred to Great Britain.
  Domestic slavery formerly existed; but on the advice of the British
  government a decree was issued by the sultan on the 1st of August 1890,
  enacting that no one born after that date could be a slave, and this was
  followed in 1907 by a decree abolishing the legal status of slavery. In
  the rest of the protectorate slavery is not recognized in any form.
  Legislation is by ordinances made by the governor, with the assent of the
  legislative council. The judicial system is based on Indian models,
  though in cases in which Africans are concerned regard is had to <!--
  Page 604 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page604"></a>[v.04
  p.0604]</span>native customs. Europeans have the right to trial by jury
  in serious cases. There is a police force of about 2000 men, and two
  battalions of the King's African Rifles are stationed in the
  protectorate. Revenue is derived chiefly from customs, licences and
  excise, railway earnings, and posts and telegraphs. Natives pay a hut
  tax. Since the completion of the Uganda railway, trade, and consequently
  revenue, has increased greatly. In 1900-1901 the revenue was £64,275 and
  the expenditure £193,438; in 1904-1905 the figures were: revenue
  £154,756, expenditure £302,559; in 1905-1906 the totals were £270,362 and
  £418,839, and in 1906-1907 (when the railway figures were included for
  the first time) £461,362 and £616,088. The deficiencies were made good by
  grants-in-aid from the imperial exchequer. The standard coin used is the
  rupee (16d.).</p>

  <p>Education is chiefly in the hands of the missionary societies, which
  maintain many schools where instruction is given in handicrafts, as well
  as in the ordinary branches of elementary education. There are Arab
  schools in Mombasa, and government schools for Europeans and Indians at
  Nairobi.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;From the 8th century to the 11th Arabs and
  Persians made settlements along the coast and gained political supremacy
  at many places, leading to the formation of the so-called Zenj empire.
  The history of the coast towns from that time until the establishment of
  British rule is identified with that of Zanzibar (<i>q.v.</i>). The
  interior of what is now British East Africa was first made known in the
  middle of the 19th century by the German missionaries Ludwig Krapf and
  Johannes Rebmann, and by Baron Karl von der Decken (1833-1865) and
  others. Von der Decken and three other Europeans were murdered by Somali
  at a town called Bardera in October 1865, whilst exploring the Juba
  river. The countries east of Victoria Nyanza (Masailand, &amp;c.) were,
  however, first traversed throughout their whole extent by the Scottish
  traveller Joseph Thomson (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1883-1884. In 1888 Count S.
  Teleki (a Hungarian) discovered Lakes Rudolf and Stefanie.</p>

  <p>The growth of British interests in the country now forming the
  protectorate arises from its connexion with the sultanate of Zanzibar. At
  Zanzibar British influence was very strong in the last quarter of the
  19th century, and the seyyid or sultan, Bargash, depended greatly on the
  advice of the British representative, Sir John Kirk. In 1877 Bargash
  offered to Mr (afterwards Sir) William Mackinnon (1823-1893), chairman of
  the British India Steam Navigation Company, a merchant in whom he had
  great confidence, or to a company to be formed by him, a lease for 70
  years of the customs and administration of the whole of the mainland
  dominions of Zanzibar including, with certain reservations, rights of
  sovereignty. This was declined owing to a lack of support by the foreign
  office, and concessions obtained in 1884 by Mr (afterwards Sir) H.H.
  Johnston in the Kilimanjaro district were, at the time, disregarded. The
  large number of concessions acquired by Germans in 1884-1885 on the East
  African coast aroused, however, the interest of those who recognized the
  paramount importance of the maintenance of British influence in those
  regions. A British claim, ratified by an agreement with Germany in 1886,
  was made to the districts behind Mombasa; and in May 1887 Bargash granted
  to an association formed by Mackinnon a concession for the administration
  of so much of his mainland territory as lay outside the region which the
  British government had recognized as the German sphere of operations. By
  international agreement the mainland territories of the sultan were
  defined as extending 10 m. inland from the coast. Mackinnon's
  association, whose object <span class="sidenote">A chartered company
  formed.</span> was to open up the hinterland as well as this ten-mile
  strip, became the Imperial British East Africa Company by a founder's
  agreement of April 1888, and received a royal charter in September of the
  same year. To this company the sultan made a further concession dated
  October 1888. On the faith of these concessions and the charters a sum of
  £240,000 was subscribed, and the company received formal charge of their
  concessions. The path of the company was speedily beset with
  difficulties, which in the first instance arose out of the aggressions of
  the German East African Company. This company had also received a grant
  from the sultan in October 1888, and its appearance on the coast was
  followed by grave disturbances among the tribes which had welcomed the
  British. This outbreak led to a joint British and German blockade, which
  seriously hampered trade operations. It had also been anticipated, in
  reliance on certain assurances of Prince Bismarck, emphasized by Lord
  Salisbury, that German enterprise in the interior of the country would be
  confined to the south of Victoria Nyanza. Unfortunately this expectation
  was not realized. Moreover German subjects put forward claims to coast
  districts, notably Lamu, within the company's sphere and in many ways
  obstructed the company's operations. In all these disputes the German
  government countenanced its own subjects, while the British foreign
  office did little or nothing to assist the company, sometimes directly
  discouraging its activity. Moreover, the company had agreed by the
  concession of October 1888 to pay a high revenue to the
  sultan&mdash;Bargash had died in the preceding March and the Germans were
  pressing his successor to give them a grant of Lamu&mdash;in lieu of the
  customs collected at the ports they took over. The disturbance caused by
  the German claims had a detrimental effect on trade and put a
  considerable strain on the resources of the company. The action of the
  company in agreeing to onerous financial burdens was dictated partly by
  regard for imperial interests, which would have been seriously weakened
  had Lamu gone to the Germans.</p>

  <p>By the hinterland doctrine, accepted both by Great Britain and Germany
  in the diplomatic correspondence of July 1887, Uganda would fall within
  Great Britain's "sphere of influence"; but German public opinion did not
  so regard the matter. German maps assigned the territory to Germany,
  while in England public opinion as strongly expected British influence to
  be paramount. In 1889 Karl Peters, a German official, led what was
  practically a raiding expedition into that country, after running a
  blockade of the ports. An expedition under F.J. Jackson had been sent by
  the company in the same year to Victoria Nyanza, but with instructions to
  avoid Uganda. In consequence of representations from Uganda, and of
  tidings he received of Peters's doings, Jackson, however, determined to
  go to that country. Peters retired at Jackson's approach, claiming,
  nevertheless, to have made certain treaties which constituted "effective
  occupation." Peters's treaty was dated the 1st of March 1890: Jackson
  concluded another in April. Meantime negotiations were proceeding in
  Europe; and by the Anglo-German agreement of the 1st of July 1890 Uganda
  was assigned to the British sphere. To consolidate their position in
  Uganda&mdash;the French missionaries there were hostile to Great
  Britain&mdash;the company sent thither Captain F.D. Lugard, who reached
  Mengo, the capital, in December 1890 and established the authority of the
  company despite French intrigues. In July 1890 representatives of the
  powers assembled at Brussels had agreed on common efforts for the
  suppression of the slave trade. The interference of the company in Uganda
  had been a material step towards that object, which they sought to
  further and at the same time to open up the country by the construction
  of a railway from Mombasa to Victoria Nyanza. But their resources being
  inadequate for such an undertaking they sought imperial aid. Although
  Lord Salisbury, then prime minister, paid the highest tribute to the
  company's labours, and a preliminary grant for the survey had been
  practically agreed upon, the scheme was wrecked in parliament. At a later
  date, however, the railway was built entirely at government cost
  (<i>supra</i>, § <i>Communications</i>). Owing to the financial strain
  imposed upon it the company decided to withdraw Captain Lugard and his
  forces in August 1891; and eventually the British government assumed a
  protectorate over the country (see <span class="sc">Uganda</span>).</p>

  <p>Further difficulties now arose which led finally to the extinction of
  the company. Its pecuniary interests sustained a severe <span
  class="sidenote">The company and the crown.</span> blow owing to the
  British government&mdash;which had taken Zanzibar under its protection in
  November 1890&mdash;declaring (June 1892) the dominions of the sultan
  within the free trade zone. This act extinguished the treaties regulating
  all tariffs and duties with foreign powers, and gave free trade all along
  the coast. The result for the company was that dues were now swept away
  without compensation, and the company was left saddled with the payment
  of the rent, and with the cost, in addition, of administration, <!-- Page
  605 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page605"></a>[v.04
  p.0605]</span>the necessary revenue for which had been derived from the
  dues thus abolished. Moreover, a scheme of taxation which it drew up
  failed to gain the approval of the foreign office.</p>

  <p>In every direction the company's affairs had drifted into an
  <i>impasse</i>. Plantations had been taken over on the coast and worked
  at a loss, money had been advanced to native traders and lost, and
  expectations of trade had been disappointed. At this crisis Sir William
  Mackinnon, the guiding spirit of the company, died (June 1893). At a
  meeting of shareholders on the 8th of May 1894 an offer to surrender the
  charter to the government was approved, though not without strong
  protests. Negotiations dragged on for over two years, and ultimately the
  terms of settlement were that the government should purchase the
  property, rights and assets of the company in East Africa for £250,000.
  Although the company had proved unprofitable for the shareholders (when
  its accounts were wound up they disclosed a total deficit of £193,757) it
  had accomplished a great deal of good work and had brought under British
  sway not only the head waters of the upper Nile, but a rich and healthy
  upland region admirably adapted for European colonization. To the
  judgment, foresight and patriotism of Sir William Mackinnon British East
  Africa practically owes its foundation. Sir William and his colleagues of
  the company were largely animated by humanitarian motives&mdash;the
  desire to suppress slavery and to improve the condition of the natives.
  With this aim they prohibited the drink traffic, started industrial
  missions, built roads, and administered impartial justice. In the opinion
  of a later administrator (Sir C. Eliot), their work and that of their
  immediate successors was the greatest philanthropic achievement of the
  latter part of the 19th century.</p>

  <p>On the 1st of July 1895 the formal transfer to the British crown of
  the territory administered by the company took place at Mombasa, the
  foreign office assuming responsibility for its administration. The
  territory, hitherto known as "Ibea," from the initials of the company,
  was now styled the East Africa protectorate. The small sultanate of Witu
  (<i>q.v.</i>) on the mainland opposite Lamu, from 1885 to 1890 a German
  protectorate, was included in the British protectorate. Coincident with
  the transfer of the administration to the imperial government a dispute
  as to the succession to a chieftainship in the Mazrui, the most important
  Arab family on the coast, led to a revolt which lasted ten months and
  involved much hard fighting. It ended in April 1896 in the flight of the
  rebel leaders to German territory, where they were interned. The
  rebellion marks an important epoch in the history of the protectorate as
  its suppression definitely substituted European for Arab influence.
  "Before the rebellion," says Sir C. Eliot, "the coast was a protected
  Arab state; since its suppression it has been growing into a British
  colony."</p>

  <p>From 1896, when the building of the Mombasa-Victoria Nyanza railway
  was begun, until 1903, when the line was <span class="sidenote">A white
  man's country.</span> practically completed, the energies of the
  administration were largely absorbed in that great work, and in
  establishing effective control over the Masai, Somali, and other tribes.
  The coast lands apart, the protectorate was regarded as valuable chiefly
  as being the high road to Uganda. But as the railway reached the high
  plateaus the discovery was made that there were large areas of
  land&mdash;very sparsely peopled&mdash;where the climate was excellent
  and where the conditions were favourable to European colonization. The
  completion of the railway, by affording transport facilities, made it
  practicable to open the country to settlers. The first application for
  land was made in April 1902 by the East Africa Syndicate&mdash;a company
  in which financiers belonging to the Chartered Company of South Africa
  were interested&mdash;which sought a grant of 500 sq. m.; and this was
  followed by other applications for considerable areas, a scheme being
  also propounded for a large Jewish settlement.</p>

  <p>During 1903 the arrival of hundreds of prospective settlers, chiefly
  from South Africa, led to the decision to entertain no more applications
  for large areas of land, especially as questions were raised concerning
  the preservation for the Masai of their rights of pasturage. In the
  carrying out of this policy a dispute arose between Lord Lansdowne,
  foreign secretary, and Sir Charles Eliot, who had been commissioner since
  1900. The foreign secretary, believing himself bound by pledges given to
  the syndicate, decided that they should be granted the lease of the 500
  sq. m. they had applied for; but after consulting officials of the
  protectorate then in London, he refused Sir Charles Eliot permission to
  conclude leases for 50 sq. m. each to two applicants from South Africa.
  Sir Charles thereupon resigned his post, and in a public telegram to the
  prime minister, dated Mombasa, the 21st of June 1904, gave as his
  reason:&mdash;"Lord Lansdowne ordered me to refuse grants of land to
  certain private persons while giving a monopoly of land on unduly
  advantageous terms to the East Africa Syndicate. I have refused to
  execute these instructions, which I consider unjust and impolitic."<a
  name="FnAnchor_121" href="#Footnote_121"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the day Sir Charles sent this telegram the appointment of Sir
  Donald W. Stewart, the chief commissioner of Ashanti, to succeed him was
  announced. Sir Donald induced the Masai whose grazing rights were
  threatened to remove to another district, and a settlement of the land
  claims was arranged. An offer to the Zionist Association of land for
  colonization by Jews was declined in August 1905 by that body, after the
  receipt of a report by a commissioner sent to examine the land (6000 sq.
  m.) offered. Sir Donald Stewart died on the 1st of October 1905, and was
  succeeded by Colonel Hayes Sadler, the commissioner of Uganda. Meantime,
  in April 1905, the administration of the protectorate had been
  transferred from the foreign to the colonial office. By the close of 1905
  considerably over a million acres of land had been leased or sold by the
  protectorate authorities&mdash;about half of it for grazing purposes. In
  1907, to meet the demands of the increasing number of white inhabitants,
  who had formed a Colonists' Association<a name="FnAnchor_122"
  href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[2]</sup></a> for the promotion of their
  interests, a legislative council was established, and on this council
  representatives of the settlers were given seats. The style of the chief
  official was also altered, "governor" being substituted for
  "commissioner". In the same year a scheme was drawn up for assisting the
  immigration of British Indians to the regions adjacent to the coast and
  to Victoria Nyanza, districts not suitable for settlement by
  Europeans.</p>

  <p>In general the relations of the British with the tribes of the
  interior have been satisfactory. The Somali in Jubaland have given some
  trouble, but the Masai, notwithstanding their warlike reputation,
  accepted peaceably the control of the whites. This was due, in great
  measure, to the fact that at the period in question plague carried off
  their cattle wholesale and reduced them for years to a state of want and
  weakness which destroyed their warlike habits. One of the most
  troublesome tribes proved to be the Nandi, who occupied the southern part
  of the plateau west of the Mau escarpment. They repeatedly raided their
  less warlike neighbours and committed wholesale thefts from the railway
  and telegraph lines. In September 1905 an expedition was sent against
  them which reduced the tribe to submission in the following November; and
  early in 1906 the Nandi were removed into a reserve. The majority of the
  natives, unaccustomed to regular work, showed themselves averse from
  taking service under the white farmers. The inadequacy of the labour
  supply was an early cause of trouble to the settlers, while the labour
  regulations enforced led, during 1907-1908, to considerable friction
  between the colonists and the administration.</p>

  <p>For several years after the establishment of the protectorate the
  northern region remained very little known and no attempt was made to
  administer the district. The natives were frequently raided by parties of
  Gallas and Abyssinians, and in the absence of a defined frontier
  Abyssinian government posts were pushed south to Lake Rudolf. The
  Abyssinians also made themselves masters of the Boran country. After long
  negotiations an agreement as to the boundary line between the lake and
  <!-- Page 606 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page606"></a>[v.04
  p.0606]</span>the river Juba was signed at Adis Ababa on the 6th of
  December 1907, and in 1908-1909 the frontier was delimited by an
  Anglo-Abyssinian commission, Major C.W. Gwynn being the chief British
  representative. Save for its north-eastern extremity Lake Rudolf was
  assigned to the British, Lake Stefanie falling to Abyssinia, while from
  about 4° 20&prime; N. the Daua to its junction with the Juba became the
  frontier.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The most comprehensive
  account of the protectorate to the close of 1904, especially of its
  economic resources, is <i>The East Africa Protectorate</i>, by Sir
  Charles Eliot (London, 1905). The progress of the protectorate is
  detailed in the <i>Reports</i> by the governor issued annually by the
  British government since 1896, and in <i>Drumkey's Year Book for East
  Africa</i> (Bombay), first issued in 1908. The <i>Précis of
  Information</i> concerning the British East Africa Protectorate (issued
  by the War Office, London, 1901) is chiefly valuable for its historical
  information. The work of the Imperial British East Africa Company is
  concisely and authoritatively told from official documents in <i>British
  East Africa or Ibea</i>, by P.L. McDermont (new ed., London, 1895).
  Another book, valuable for its historical perspective, is <i>The
  Foundation of British East Africa</i>, by J.W. Gregory (London, 1901).
  Bishop A.R. Tucker's <i>Eighteen Years in Uganda and East Africa</i>
  (London, 1908) contains a summary of missionary labours. Of the works of
  explorers <i>Through Masai Land</i>, by Joseph Thomson (London, 1886), is
  specially valuable. For the northern frontier see Capt. P. Maud's report
  in <i>Africa No. 13</i> (1904). For geology see, besides Thomson's book,
  <i>The Great Rift Valley</i>, by J.W. Gregory (London, 1896); <i>Across
  an East African Glacier</i>, by Hans Meyer (London and Leipzig, 1890);
  and <i>Report relating to the Geology of the East Africa
  Protectorate</i>, by H.B. Muff (Colonial Office, London, 1908). For big
  game and ornithology see <i>On Safari</i>, by A. Chapman (London, 1908).

  <p><b>BRITISH EMPIRE</b>, the name now loosely given to the whole
  aggregate of territory, the inhabitants of which, under various forms of
  government, ultimately look to the British crown as the supreme head. The
  term "empire" is in this connexion obviously used rather for convenience
  than in any sense equivalent to that of the older or despotic empires of
  history.</p>

  <p>The land surface of the earth is estimated to extend over about
  52,500,000 sq. m. Of this area the British empire occupies <span
  class="sidenote">Extent.</span> nearly one-quarter, extending over an
  area of about 12,000,000 sq. m. By far the greater portion lies within
  the temperate zones, and is suitable for white settlement. The notable
  exceptions are the southern half of India and Burma; East, West and
  Central Africa; the West Indian colonies; the northern portion of
  Australia; New Guinea, British Borneo and that portion of North America
  which extends into Arctic regions. The area of the territory of the
  empire is divided almost equally between the southern and the northern
  hemispheres, the great divisions of Australasia and South Africa covering
  between them in the southern hemisphere 5,308,506 sq. m., while the
  United Kingdom, Canada and India, including the native states, cover
  between them in the northern hemisphere 5,271,375 sq. m. The alternation
  of the seasons is thus complete, one-half of the empire enjoying summer,
  while one-half is in winter. The division of territory between the
  eastern and western hemispheres is less equal, Canada occupying alone in
  the western hemisphere 3,653,946 sq. m., while Australasia, South Africa,
  India and the United Kingdom occupy together in the eastern hemisphere
  6,925,975 sq. m. As a matter of fact, however, the eastern portions of
  Australasia border so nearly upon the western hemisphere that the
  distribution of day and night throughout the empire is, like the
  alternations of the seasons, almost complete, one-half enjoying daylight,
  while the other half is in darkness. These alternations of time and of
  seasons, combined with the variety of soils and climates, are calculated
  to have an increasingly important effect upon the material and
  industrial, as well as upon the social and political developments of the
  empire. This will become evident in considering the industrial
  productions of the different divisions, and the harvest seasons which
  permit the summer produce of one portion of the empire to supply the
  winter requirements of its other markets, and conversely.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;">

      alt="The British Empire." title="The British Empire." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The empire contains or is bounded by some of the highest mountains,
  the greatest lakes, and the most important rivers of the world. Its
  climates may be said to include all the known climates of the world; its
  soils are no less various. In the prairies of central Canada it possesses
  some of the most valuable wheat-producing land; in the grass lands of the
  interior of Australia the best pasture country; and in the uplands of
  South Africa the most valuable gold- and diamond-bearing beds which
  exist. The United Kingdom at present produces more coal than any other
  single country except the United States. The effect of climate throughout
  the empire in modifying the type of the Anglo-Saxon race has as yet
  received only partial attention, and conclusions regarding it are of a
  somewhat empiric nature. The general tendency in Canada is held to be
  towards somewhat smaller size, and a hardy active habit; in Australia to
  a tall, slight, pale development locally known as "cornstalkers,"
  characterized by considerable nervous and intellectual activity. In New
  Zealand the type preserves almost exactly the characteristics of the
  British Isles. The South African, both Dutch and British, is readily
  recognized by an apparently sun-dried, lank and hard habit of body. In
  the tropical possessions of the empire, where white settlement does not
  take place to any considerable extent, the individual alone is affected.
  The type undergoes no modification. It is to be observed in reference to
  this interesting aspect of imperial development, that the multiplication
  and cheapening of channels of communication and means of travel
  throughout the empire will tend to modify the future accentuation of race
  difference, while the variety of elements in the vast area occupied
  should have an important, though as yet not scientifically traced, effect
  upon the British imperial type.</p>

  <p>The white population of the empire<a name="FnAnchor_131"
  href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[1]</sup></a> reached in 1901 a total of over
  53,000,000, or something over one-eighth of its entire <span
  class="sidenote">Population.</span> population, which, including native
  races, is estimated at about 400,000,000. The white population includes
  some French, Dutch and Spanish peoples, but is mainly of Anglo-Saxon
  race. It is distributed roughly as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The populations of the West Indies are very various, being made up
  largely of imported African negroes. In Jamaica these contribute
  four-fifths of the population. There are also in the islands a
  considerable number of imported East Indian coolies and some Chinese. The
  aboriginal races include American Indians of the mainland and Caribs.
  With these there has been intermixture of Spanish and Portuguese blood,
  and many mixed types have appeared. The total European population of this
  group of colonies amounts to upwards of 80,000, to which 15,000 on
  account of Bermuda may be added.</p>

  <p>The aboriginal races of South Africa were the Bushmen and Hottentots.
  Both these races are rapidly diminishing in numbers, and in British South
  Africa it is expected that they will in the course of the twentieth
  century become extinct. Besides these primitive races there are the
  dark-skinned negroids of Bantu stock, commonly known in their tribal
  groups as Kaffirs, Zulu, Bechuana and Damara, which are again subdivided
  into many lesser groups. The Bantu compose the greater part of the native
  population. There are also in South Africa Malays and Indians and others,
  who during the last two hundred years have been introduced from Java,
  Ceylon, Madagascar, Mozambique and British India, and by intermarriage
  with each other and with the natives have produced a hybrid population
  generally classed together under the heading of the Mixed Races. These
  are of all colours, varying from yellow to dark brown. The tribes of
  Central Africa are as yet less known. Many of them exhibit racial
  characteristics allied to those of the tribes of South Africa, but with
  in some cases an admixture of Arab blood.</p>

  <p>From east to west across Africa the aboriginal nations are mostly of
  the black negroid type, their varieties being only imperfectly known. The
  tendency of some of the lower negroid types has been to drift towards the
  west coast, where they still practise cannibalistic and fetish rites. On
  the east coast are found much higher types approaching to the Christian
  races of Abyssinia, and from east to west there has been a wide admixture
  of Arab blood producing a light-brown type. In Uganda and Nigeria a large
  proportion of the population is Arab and relatively light-skinned.</p>

  <p>The native races of Australia and the Polynesian groups of islands are
  divided into two main types known as the dark and light Polynesian. The
  dark type, which is black, is of a very low order, and in some of the
  islands still retains its cannibal habits. The aboriginal tribes of
  Australia are of a low-class black race, but generally peaceful and
  inoffensive in their habits. The white Polynesian races are of a very
  superior type, and exhibit, as in the Maoris of New Zealand,
  characteristics of a high order. The natives of Papua (New Guinea) are in
  a very low state of civilization. The estimate given of their numbers is
  approximate, as no census has been taken.</p>

  <p>This is without taking into account the population of the lesser crown
  colonies or allowing for the increase likely to be shown by later
  censuses. Throughout the empire, and notably in the United Kingdom, there
  is among the white races a considerable sprinkling of Jewish blood.</p>

  <p>The latest calculation of the entire population of the world,
  including a liberal estimate of 650,000,000 for peoples not brought under
  any census, gives a total of something over 1,500,000,000. The population
  of the empire may therefore be calculated as amounting to something more
  than one-fourth of the population of the world.</p>

  <p>It is a matter of first importance in the geographical distribution of
  the empire that the five principal divisions, the United <span
  class="sidenote">Divisions.</span> Kingdom, South Africa, India,
  Australia and Canada are separated from each other by the three great
  oceans of the world. The distance as usually calculated in nautical
  miles: from an English port to the Cape of Good Hope is 5840 m.; from the
  Cape of Good Hope to Bombay is 4610; from Bombay to Melbourne is 5630;
  from Melbourne to Auckland is 1830; from Auckland to Vancouver is 6210;
  from Halifax to Liverpool is 2744. From a British port direct to Bombay
  by way of the Mediterranean it is 6272; from a British port by the same
  route to Sydney 11,548 m. These great distances have necessitated the
  acquisition of intermediate ports suitable for coaling stations on the
  trade routes, and have determined the position of many of the lesser
  crown colonies which are held simply for military and commercial
  purposes. Such are the Bermudas, Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, Ceylon, the
  Straits Settlements, Labuan, Hong-Kong, which complete the <!-- Page 608
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page608"></a>[v.04 p.0608]</span>chain
  of connexion on the eastern route, and such on other routes are the
  lesser West African stations, Ascension, St. Helena, the Mauritius and
  Seychelles, the Falklands, Tristan da Cunha, and the groups of the
  western Pacific. Other annexations of the British empire have been rocky
  islets of the northern Pacific required for the purpose of telegraph
  stations in connexion with an all-British cable.</p>

  <p>For purposes of political administration the empire falls into the
  three sections of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with
  the dependencies of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; the Indian
  empire, consisting of British India and the feudatory native states; and
  the colonial empire, comprising all other colonies and dependencies.</p>

  <p>In the modern sense of extension beyond the limits of the United
  Kingdom the growth of the empire is of comparatively <span
  class="sidenote">Growth.</span> recent date. The Channel Islands became
  British as a part of the Norman inheritance of William the Conqueror. The
  Isle of Man, which was for a short time held in conquest by Edward I. and
  restored, was sold by its titular sovereign to Sir William Scrope, earl
  of Wiltshire, in 1393, and by his subsequent attainder for high treason
  and the confiscation of his estates, became a fief of the English crown.
  It was granted by Henry IV. in 1406 to Sir John Stanley, K.C., ancestor
  of the earls of Derby, by whom it was held till 1736, when it passed to
  James Murray, 2nd duke of Atholl, as heir-general of the 10th earl. It
  was inherited by his daughter Charlotte, wife of the 3rd duke of Atholl,
  who sold it to the crown for £70,000 and an annuity of £2000. With these
  exceptions and the nominal possession taken of Newfoundland by Sir
  Humphrey Gilbert in 1583, all the territorial acquisitions of the empire
  have been made in the 17th and subsequent centuries.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of the British colonies and dependencies
  (other than those belonging to the Indian empire) together with a summary
  statement of the date and method of their acquisition. Arranged in
  chronological order they give some idea of the rate of growth of the
  empire. The dates are not, however, in all cases those in which British
  sovereignty was established. They indicate in some instances only the
  first definite step, such as the building of a fort, the opening of a
  trading station, or other act, which led later to the incorporation in
  the empire of the country indicated. In the case of Australian states or
  Canadian provinces originally part of other states or provinces the date
  is that, approximately, of the first settlement of British in the
  district named; <i>e.g.</i> there were British colonists in Saskatchewan
  in the last half of the 18th century, but the province was not
  constituted until 1905. Save where otherwise stated, British authority
  has been continuous from the first date mentioned in the table. Reference
  should be made to the articles on the various colonies.</p>

  <p>In certain dependencies the sovereignty of Great Britain is not
  absolute. The island of Cyprus is nominally still part of the Turkish
  empire, but in 1878 was handed over to Great Britain for occupation and
  administration; Great Britain now making to the Porte on account of the
  island an annual payment of £5000. The administration is in the hands of
  an official styled high commissioner, who is invested with the powers
  usually conferred on a colonial governor. In Zanzibar and other regions
  of equatorial Africa the native rulers retain considerable powers; in the
  Far East certain areas are held on lease from China.</p>

  <p>Egypt, without forming part of the British empire, came under the
  military occupation of Great Britain in 1882. "By right of conquest"
  Great Britain subsequently claimed a share in the administration of the
  former Sudan provinces of Egypt, and an agreement of the 19th of January
  1899 established the joint sovereignty of Great Britain and Egypt over
  what is now known as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</p>

  <p>The Indian section of the empire was acquired during the 17th-19th
  centuries under a royal charter granted to the East India Company by
  Queen Elizabeth in 1600. It was transferred to the imperial government in
  1858, and Queen Victoria was proclaimed empress under the Royal Titles
  Act in 1877. The following list gives the dates and method of acquisition
  of the centres of the main divisions of the Indian empire. They have, in
  most instances, grown by general process of extension to their present
  dimensions.</p>

  <p>In addition to these there are British tracts known as the Upper Burma
  frontier and the Burma frontier. There is also a sphere of British
  influence in the border of Afghanistan. The state of Nepal, though
  independent as regards its internal administration, has been since the
  campaign of 1814-15 in close relations with Great Britain. It is bound to
  receive a British resident, and its political relations with other states
  are controlled by the government of India. All these native states have
  come into relative dependency upon Great Britain as a result of conquest
  or of treaty consequent upon the annexation of the neighbouring
  provinces. The settlement of Aden, with its dependencies of Perim and
  Sokotra Island, forms part of the government of Bombay.</p>

  <p>This vast congeries of states, widely different in character, and
  acquired by many different methods, holds together under <span

  on a generally acknowledged triple principle of self-government,
  self-support and self-defence. The principle is more fully applied in
  some parts of the empire than in others; there are some parts which have
  not yet completed their political evolution; some others in which the
  principle is temporarily or for special reasons in abeyance; others,
  again&mdash;chiefly those of very small extent, which are held for
  purposes of the defence or advantage of the whole&mdash;to which it is
  not applicable; but the principle is generally acknowledged as the
  structural basis upon which the constitution of the empire exists.</p>

  <p>In its relation to the empire the home section of the British Isles is
  distinguished from the others as the place of origin of the British race
  and the residence of the crown. The history and constitutional
  development of this portion of the empire will be found fully treated
  under separate headings. (See <span class="sc">England; Wales; Ireland;
  Scotland; United Kingdom; English History; India; Africa; Australia;
  Canada</span>; &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>It is enough to say that for purposes of administration the Indian
  empire is divided into nine great provinces and four minor
  commissionerships. The nine great provinces are presided over by two
  governors (Bombay and Madras), five lieut.-governors (Bengal, Eastern
  Bengal and Assam, United Provinces [Agra and Oudh], the Punjab and
  Burma), a chief commissioner (the Central Provinces) and an agent to the
  governor-general (the N.-W. Frontier Province). The four minor
  commissionerships are presided over each by a chief commissioner. Above
  these the supreme executive authority in India is vested in the viceroy
  in council. The council consists of six ordinary members besides the
  existing commander-in-chief. For legislative purposes the
  governor-general's council is increased by the addition of fifteen
  members nominated by the crown, and has power under certain restrictions
  to make laws for British India, for British subjects in the native
  states, and for native Indian subjects of the crown in any part of the
  world. The administration of the Indian empire in England is carried on
  by a secretary of state for India assisted by a council of not less than
  ten members. The expenditure of the revenues is under the control of the
  secretary in council.</p>

  <p>The colonial empire comprises over fifty distinct governments. It is
  divided into colonies of three classes and dependencies; these, again,
  are in some instances associated for administrative purposes in federated
  groups. The three classes of colonies are crown colonies, colonies
  possessing representative institutions but not responsible government,
  and colonies possessing representative institutions and responsible
  government. In crown colonies the crown has entire control of
  legislation, and the public officers are under the control of the home
  government. In representative colonies the crown has only a veto on
  legislation, but the home government retains control of the public
  officers. In responsible colonies the crown retains a veto upon
  legislation, but the home government has no control of any public officer
  except the governor.</p>

  <p>In crown colonies&mdash;with the exception of Gibraltar and St Helena,
  where laws may be made by the governor alone&mdash;laws are made by the
  governor with the concurrence of a council nominated by the crown. In
  some crown colonies, chiefly those acquired by conquest or cession, the
  authority of this council rests wholly on the crown; in others, chiefly
  those acquired by settlement, the council is created by the crown under
  the authority of local or imperial laws. The crown council of Ceylon may
  be cited as an example of the first kind, and the crown council of
  Jamaica of the second.</p>

  <p>In colonies possessing representative institutions without responsible
  government, the crown cannot (generally) legislate by order in council,
  and laws are made by the governor with the concurrence of the legislative
  body or bodies, one at least of these bodies in cases where a second
  chamber exists possessing a preponderance of elected representatives. The
  Bahamas, Barbados, and Bermuda have two legislative bodies&mdash;one
  elected and one nominated by the crown; Malta and the Leeward Islands
  have but one, which is partly elected and partly nominated.</p>

  <p>Under responsible government legislation is carried on by
  parliamentary means exactly as at home, with a cabinet responsible to
  parliament, the crown reserving only a right of veto, which is exercised
  at the discretion of the governor in the case of certain bills. The
  executive councils in those colonies, designated as at home by
  parliamentary choice, are appointed by the governor alone, and the other
  public officers only nominally by the governor on the advice of his
  executive council.</p>

  <p>Colonial governors are classed as governors-general; governors;
  lieut.-governors; administrators; high commissioners; and commissioners,
  according to the status of the colony and dependency, or group of
  colonies and dependencies, over which they preside. Their powers vary
  according to the position which they occupy. In all cases they represent
  the crown.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of this organization the finance of crown colonies is
  under the direct control of the imperial government; the finance of
  representative colonies, though not directly controlled, is usually
  influenced in important departures by the opinion of the imperial
  government. In responsible colonies the finance is entirely under local
  control, and the imperial government is dissociated from either moral or
  material responsibility for colonial debts.</p>

  <p>In federated groups of colonies and dependencies matters which are of
  common interest to a given number of separate governments are by mutual
  consent of the federating communities adjudged to the authority of a
  common government, which, in the case of self-governing colonies, is
  voluntarily created for the purpose. The associated states form under the
  federal government one federal body, but the parts retain control of
  local matters, and exercise all their original rights of government in
  regard to these. The two great self-governing groups of federated
  colonies within the empire are the Dominion of Canada and the
  Commonwealth of Australia. In South Africa unification was preferred to
  federation, the then self-governing colonies being united in 1910 into
  one state&mdash;the Union of South Africa. India, of which the associated
  provinces are under the control of the central government, may be given
  as an example of the practical federation of dependencies. Examples <!--
  Page 611 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page611"></a>[v.04
  p.0611]</span>of federated crown colonies and lesser dependencies are to
  be found in the Leeward Island group of the West Indies and the federated
  Malay States.</p>

  <p>This rough system of self-government for the empire has been evolved
  not without some strain and friction, by the recognition through the
  vicissitudes of three hundred years of the value of independent
  initiative in the development of young countries. Queen Elizabeth's first
  patent to Sir Walter Raleigh permitted British subjects to accompany him
  to America, "with guarantee of a continuance of the enjoyment of all the
  rights which her subjects enjoyed at home."</p>

  <p>This guarantee may presumably have been intended at the time only to
  assure the intending settlers that they should lose no rights of British
  citizenship at home by taking up their residence in America. Its mutual
  interpretation in a wider sense, serving at once to establish in the
  colony rights of citizenship equivalent to those enjoyed in England, and
  to preserve for the colonist the status of British subject at home and
  abroad, has formed in application to all succeeding systems of British
  colonization the unconscious charter of union of the empire.</p>

  <p>The first American colonies were settled under royal grants, each with
  its own constitution. The immense distance in time which in those days
  separated America from Great Britain secured them from interference by
  the home authorities. They paid their own most moderate governing
  expenses, and they contributed largely to their own defence. From the
  middle of the 17th century their trade was not free, but this was the
  only restriction from which they suffered. The great war with France in
  the middle of the 18th century temporarily destroyed this system. That
  war, which resulted in the conquest of Canada and the delivery of the
  North American colonies from French antagonism, cost the imperial
  exchequer £90,000,000. The attempt to avert the repetition of such
  expenditure by the assertion of a right to tax the colonies through the
  British parliament led to the one great rupture which has marked the
  history of the empire. It has to be noted that at home during the latter
  half of the 17th century and the earlier part of the 18th century
  parliamentary power had to a great extent taken the place of the divine
  right of kings. But parliamentary power meant the power of the English
  people and taxpayers. The struggle which developed itself between the
  American colonies and the British parliament was in fact a struggle on
  the part of the people and taxpayers of one portion of the empire to
  resist the domination of the people and taxpayers of another portion. In
  this light it may be accepted as having historically established the
  fundamental axiom of the constitution of the empire, that the crown is
  the supreme head from which the parts take equal dependence.</p>

  <p>The crown requiring advice in the ordinary and constitutional manner
  receives it in matters of colonial administration from the secretaries of
  state for the colonies and for India. After the great rupture separate
  provision in the home government for the administration of colonial
  affairs was at first judged to be unnecessary, and the "Council<a
  name="FnAnchor_133" href="#Footnote_133"><sup>[3]</sup></a> of Trade and
  Plantations," which up to that date had supplied the place now taken by
  the two offices of the colonies and India, was suppressed in 1782. There
  was a reaction from the liberal system of colonial self-government, and
  an attempt was made to govern the colonies simply as dependencies.</p>

  <p>In 1791, not long after the extension of the range of parliamentary
  authority in another portion of the empire, by the creation in 1784 of
  the Board of Control for India, Pitt made the step forward of granting to
  Canada representative institutions, of which the home government kept the
  responsible control. Similar institutions were also given at a later
  period to Australia and South Africa. But the long peace of the early
  part of the 19th century was marked by great colonial developments;
  Australia, Canada and South Africa became important communities.
  Representative institutions controlled by the home government were
  insufficient, and they reasserted the claim for liberty to manage their
  own affairs.</p>

  <p>Fully responsible government was granted to Canada in 1840, and
  gradually extended to the other colonies. In 1854 a separate secretary of
  state for the colonies was appointed at home, and the colonial office was
  established on its present footing. In India, as in the colonies, there
  came with the growing needs of empire a recognition of the true relations
  of the parts to each other and of the whole to the crown. In 1858, on the
  complete transference of the territories of the East India Company to the
  crown, the board of control was abolished, and the India Council, under
  the presidency of a secretary of state for India, was created. It was
  especially provided that the members of the council may not sit in
  parliament.</p>

  <p>Thus, although it has not been found practicable in the working of the
  British constitution to carry out the full theory of the direct and
  exclusive dependence of colonial possessions on the crown, the theory is
  recognized as far as possible. It is understood that the principal
  sections of the empire enjoy equal rights under the crown, and that none
  is subordinate to another. The intervention of the imperial parliament in
  colonial affairs is only admitted theoretically in so far as the support
  of parliament is required by the constitutional advisers of the crown. To
  bring the practice of the empire into complete harmony with the theory it
  would be necessary to constitute, for the purpose of advising the crown
  on imperial affairs, a council in which all important parts of the empire
  should be represented.</p>

  <p>The gradual recognition of the constitutional theory of the British
  empire, and the assumption by the principal <span
  class="sidenote">Imperialism.</span> colonies of full self-governing
  responsibilities, has cleared the way for a movement in favour of a
  further development which should bring the supreme headship of the empire
  more into accord with modern ideas.</p>

  <p>It was during the period of domination of the "Manchester school," of
  which the most effective influence in public affairs was exerted for
  about thirty years, extending from 1845 to 1875, that the fullest
  development of colonial self-government was attained, the view being
  generally accepted at that time that self-governing institutions were to
  be regarded as the preliminary to inevitable separation. A general
  inclination to withdraw from the acceptance of imperial responsibilities
  throughout the world gave to foreign nations at the same time an
  opportunity by which they were not slow to profit, and contributed to the
  force of a reaction of which the part played by Great Britain in the
  scramble for Africa marked the culmination. Under the increasing pressure
  of foreign enterprise, the value of a federation of the empire for
  purposes of common interest began to be discussed. Imperial federation
  was openly spoken of in New Zealand as early as 1852. A similar
  suggestion was officially put forward by the general association of the
  Australian colonies in London in 1857. The Royal Colonial Institution, of
  which the motto "United Empire" illustrates its aims, was founded in
  1868. First among leading British statesmen to repudiate the old
  interpretation of colonial self-government as a preliminary to
  separation, Lord Beaconsfield, in 1872, spoke of the constitutions
  accorded to the colonies as "part of a great policy of imperial
  consolidation." In 1875 W. E. Forster, afterwards a member of the Liberal
  government, made a speech in which he advocated imperial federation as a
  means by which it might become practicable to "replace dependence by
  association." The foundation of the Imperial Federation League&mdash;in
  1884, with Forster for its first president, shortly to be succeeded by
  Lord Rosebery&mdash;marked a distinct step forward. The Colonial
  Conferences of 1887 and subsequent years (the title being changed to
  Imperial Conference in 1907), in which colonial opinion was sought and
  accepted in respect of important questions of imperial organization and
  defence, and the enthusiastic loyalty displayed by the colonies towards
  the crown on the occasion of the jubilee manifestations of Queen
  Victoria's reign, were further indications of progress in the same
  direction. Coincidently with this development, the achievements of Sir
  George Goldie and Cecil Rhodes, who, the one in West Africa and the other
  in South Africa, added between them to the empire in a space of less than
  twenty years a dominion of greater extent than the whole of British <!--
  Page 612 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page612"></a>[v.04
  p.0612]</span>India, followed by the action of a host of distinguished
  disciples in other parts of the world, effectually stemmed the movement
  initiated by Cobden and Bright. A tendency which had seemed temporarily
  to point towards a complacent dissolution of the empire was arrested, and
  the closing years of the 19th century were marked by a growing
  disposition to appreciate the value and importance of the unique position
  which the British empire has created for itself in the world. No stronger
  demonstration of the reality of imperial union could be needed than that
  which was afforded by the support given to the imperial forces by the
  colonies and India in the South African War. It remained only to be seen
  by what process of evolution the further consolidation of the empire
  would find expression in the machinery of government. A step in this
  direction was taken in 1907, when at the Colonial Conference held in
  London that year it was decided to form a permanent secretariat to deal
  with the common interests of the self-governing colonies and the
  mother-country. It was further decided that conferences, to be called in
  future Imperial Conferences, between the home government and the
  governments of the self-governing dominions, should be held every four
  years, and that the prime minister of Great Britain should be <i>ex
  officio</i> president of the conference. No executive power was, however,
  conferred upon the conference.</p>

  <p>The movement in favour of tariff reform initiated by Mr Chamberlain
  (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1903 with the double object of giving a preference to
  colonial goods and of protecting imperial trade by the imposition in
  certain cases of retaliative duties on foreign goods, was a natural
  evolution of the imperialist idea, and of the fact that by this time the
  trade-statistics of the United Kingdom had proved that trade with the
  colonies was forming an increasingly large proportion of the whole. In
  spite of the defeat of the Unionist party in England in 1906, and the
  accession to power of a Liberal government opposed to anything which
  appeared to be inconsistent with free trade, the movement for colonial
  preference, based on tariff reform, continued to make headway in the
  United Kingdom, and was definitely adopted by the Unionist party. And at
  the Imperial Conference of 1907 it was advocated by all the colonial
  premiers, who could point to the progress made in their own states
  towards giving a tariff preference to British goods and to those of one
  another.</p>

  <p>The question of self-government is closely associated with the
  question of self-support. Plenty of good land and the liberty to manage
  their own affairs were the causes assigned by Adam Smith for the marked
  prosperity of the British colonies towards the end of the 18th century.
  The same causes are still observed to produce the same effects, and it
  may be pointed out that, since the date of the latest of Adam Smith's
  writings, upwards of 6,000,000 sq. m. of virgin soil, rich with
  possibilities of agricultural, pastoral and mineral wealth, have been
  added to the empire. In the same period the white population has grown
  from about 12,000,000 to 53,000,000, and the developments of agricultural
  and industrial machinery have multiplied, almost beyond computation, the
  powers of productive labour.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely possible within this article to deal with so widely
  varied a subject as that of the productions and industry of the <span
  class="sidenote">The imperial factor in industry and trade.</span>
  empire. For the purposes of a general statement, it is interesting to
  observe that concurrently with the acquisition of the vast continental
  areas during the 19th century, the progress of industrial science in
  application to means of transport and communication brought about a
  revolution of the most radical character in the accepted laws of economic
  development. Railways did away with the old law that the spread of
  civilization is necessarily governed by facilities for water carriage and
  is consequently confined to river valleys and sea-shores. Steam and
  electricity opened to industry the interior of continents previously
  regarded as unapproachable. The resources of these vast inland spaces
  which have lain untouched since history began became available to
  individual enterprise, and over a great portion of the earth's surface
  were brought within the possessions of the British empire. The production
  of raw material within the empire increased at a rate which can only be
  appreciated by a careful study of figures, and by a comparison of the
  total of these figures with the total figures of the world. The tropical
  and temperate possessions of the empire include every field of production
  which can be required for the use of man. There is no main staple of
  human food which is not grown; there is no material of textile industry
  which is not produced. The British empire gives occupation to more than
  one-third of the persons employed in mining and quarrying in the world.
  It may be interesting, as an indication of the relative position in this
  respect of the British empire to the world, to state that at present it
  produces one-third of the coal supply of the world, one-sixth of the
  wheat supply, and very nearly two-thirds of the gold supply. But while
  these figures may be taken as in themselves satisfactory, it is far more
  important to remember that as yet the potential resources of the new
  lands opened to enterprise have been barely conceived, and their wealth
  has been little more than scratched. Population as yet has been only very
  sparsely sprinkled over the surface of many of the areas most suitable
  for white settlement. In the wheat lands of Canada, the pastoral country
  of Australasia, and the mineral fields of South Africa and western Canada
  alone, the undeveloped resources are such as to ensure employment to the
  labour and satisfaction to the needs of at least as many millions as they
  now contain thousands of the British race. In respect of this promise of
  the future the position of the British empire is unique.</p>

  <p>It is not too much to say that trade has been at once the most active
  cause of expansion and the most potent bond of union in the development
  of the empire. Trade with the tropical and settlement in the temperate
  regions of the world formed the basis upon which the foundations of the
  empire were laid. Trading companies founded most of the American and West
  Indian colonies; a trading company won India; a trading company colonized
  the north-western districts of Canada; commercial wars during the greater
  part of the 18th century established the British command of the sea,
  which rendered the settlement of Australasia possible. The same wars gave
  Great Britain South Africa, and chartered companies in the 19th century
  carried the British flag into the interior of the African continent from
  south and east and west. Trading companies developed Borneo and Fiji. The
  bonds of prosperous trade have kept the Australasian colonies within the
  empire. The protection of colonial commerce by the imperial navy is one
  of the strongest of material links which connect the crown with the
  outlying possessions of the empire.</p>

  <p>The trade of the empire, like the other developments of imperial
  public life, has been profoundly influenced by the variety of <span
  class="sidenote">Imperial trade policy.</span> local conditions under
  which it has flourished. In the early settlement of the North American
  colonies their trade was left practically free; but by the famous
  Navigation Act of 1660 the importation and exportation of goods from
  British colonies were restricted to British ships, of which the master
  and three-fourths of the mariners were English. This act, of which the
  intention was to encourage British shipping and to keep the monopoly of
  British colonial trade for the benefit of British merchants, was followed
  by many others of a similar nature up to the time of the repeal of the
  Corn Laws in 1846 and the introduction of free trade into Great Britain.
  The Navigation Acts were repealed in 1849. Thus for very nearly two
  hundred years British trade was subject to restrictions, of which the
  avowed intention was to curtail the commercial intercourse of the empire
  with the world. During this period the commercial or mercantile system,
  of which the fallacies were exposed by the economists of the latter half
  of the 18th century, continued to govern the principles of British trade.
  Under this system monopolies were common, and among them few were more
  important than that of the East India Company. In 1813 the trade of India
  was, however, thrown open to competition, and in 1846, after the
  introduction of free trade at home, the principal British colonies which
  had not yet at that date received the grant of responsible government
  were specially empowered to abolish differential duties upon foreign
  trade. A first result of the commercial emancipation of the <!-- Page 613
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page613"></a>[v.04
  p.0613]</span>colonies was the not altogether unnatural rise in the
  manufacturing centres of the political school known as the Manchester
  school, which was disposed to question the value to Great Britain of the
  retention of colonies which were no longer bound to give her the monopoly
  of their commercial markets. An equally natural desire on the part of the
  larger colonies to profit by the opportunity which was opened to them of
  establishing local manufactures of their own, combined with the
  convenience in new countries of using the customs as an instrument of
  taxation, led to something like a reciprocal feeling of resentment, and
  there followed a period during which the policy of Great Britain was to
  show no consideration for colonial trade, and the policy of the principal
  colonies was to impose heavy duties upon British trade. By a gradual
  process of better understanding, largely helped by the development of
  means of communication, the antagonistic extreme was abandoned, and a
  tendency towards a system of preferential duties within the empire
  displayed itself.</p>

  <p>At the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887 a proposal was
  formally submitted by the South <span class="sidenote">Colonial
  preference.</span> African delegate for the establishment within the
  empire of a preferential system, imposing a duty of 2% upon all foreign
  goods, the proceeds to be directed to the maintenance of the imperial
  navy. To this end it was requested that certain treaties with foreign
  nations which imposed restrictions on the trade of various parts of the
  empire with each other should be denounced. Some years later, a strong
  feeling having been manifested in England against any foreign engagement
  standing in the way of new domestic trade arrangements between a colony
  and the mother-country, the German and Belgian treaties in question were
  denounced (1897). Meanwhile, simultaneously with the movement in favour
  of reciprocal fiscal advantages to be granted within the empire by the
  many local governments to each other, there was a growth of the
  perception that an increase of the foreign trade of Great Britain,
  carried on chiefly in manufactured goods, was accompanied by a
  corresponding enlargement of the home markets for colonial raw material,
  and consequently that injury to the foreign trade of Great Britain, while
  as yet it so largely outweighed the trade between the United Kingdom and
  the colonies, must necessarily react upon the colonies. This view was
  definitely expressed at the Colonial Conference at Ottawa in 1894, and
  was one of the factors which led to the relinquishment of the demand that
  in return for colonial concessions there should be an imposition on the
  part of Great Britain of a differential duty upon foreign goods. Canada
  was the first important British colony to give substantial expression to
  the new imperial sentiment in commercial matters by the introduction in
  1897 of an imperial tariff, granting without any reciprocal advantage a
  deduction of 25% upon customs duties imposed upon British goods. The same
  advantage was offered to all British colonies trading with her upon equal
  terms. In later years the South African states, Australia and New Zealand
  also granted preferential treatment to British goods. Meanwhile in Great
  Britain the system of free imports, regarded as "free trade" (though only
  one-sided free trade), had become the established policy, customs duties
  being only imposed for purposes of revenue on a few selected articles,
  and about half the national income was derived from customs and excise.
  In most of the colonies customs form of necessity one of the important
  sources of revenue. It is, however, worthy of remark that in the
  self-governing colonies, even those which are avowedly protectionist, a
  smaller proportion of the public revenue was derived from customs and
  excise than was derived from these sources in the United Kingdom. The
  proportion in Australasia before federation was about one quarter. In
  Canada it is more difficult to estimate it, as customs and excise form
  the principal provision made for federal finance, and note must therefore
  be taken of the separate sources of revenue in the provinces. With these
  reservations it will still be seen that customs, or, in other words, a
  tax upon the movements of trade, forms one of the chief sources of
  imperial revenue.</p>

  <p>The development of steam shipping and electricity gave to the
  movements of trade a stimulus no less remarkable than that given by the
  introduction of railroads and industrial machinery to production and
  manufactures. Whereas at the beginning of the 19th century the journey to
  Australia occupied eight months, and business communications between
  Sydney and London could not receive answers within the year, at the
  beginning of the 20th century the journey could be accomplished in
  thirty-one days, and telegraphic despatches enabled the most important
  business to be transacted within twenty-four hours. For one cargo carried
  in the year at the beginning of the 19th century at least six could now
  be carried by the same ship, and from the point of view of trade the
  difference of a venture which realizes its profits in two months, as
  compared with one which occupied a whole year, does not need to be
  insisted on. The increased rapidity of the voyage and the power of daily
  communication by telegraph with the most distant markets have introduced
  a wholly new element into the national trade of the empire, and
  commercial intercourse between the southern and the northern hemispheres
  has received a development from the natural alternation of the seasons,
  of which until quite recent years the value was not even conceived.
  Fruit, eggs, butter, meat, poultry and other perishable commodities pass
  in daily increasing quantities between the northern and the southern
  hemispheres with an alternate flow which contributes to raise in no
  inconsiderable degree the volume of profitable trade. Thus the butter
  season of Australasia is from October to March, while the butter season
  of Ireland and northern Europe is from March to October. In three years
  after the introduction of ice-chambers into the steamers of the great
  shipping lines, Victoria and New South Wales built up a yearly butter
  trade of £1,000,000 with Great Britain without seriously affecting the
  Irish and Danish markets whence the summer supply is drawn. These
  facilities, combined with the enormous additions made to the public stock
  of land and labour, contributed to raise the volume of trade of the
  empire from a total of less than £100,000,000 in the year 1800 to a total
  of nearly £1,500,000,000 in 1900. The declared volume of British exports
  to all parts of the world in 1800 was £38,120,120, and the value of
  British imports from all parts of the world was £30,570,605; total,
  £68,690,725. As in those days the colonies were not allowed to trade with
  any other country this must be taken as representing imperial trade. The
  exact figures of the trade of India, the colonies, and the United Kingdom
  for 1900 were: imports, £809,178,209; exports, £657,899,363; total,
  £1,467,077,572.</p>

  <p>A question of sovereign importance to the continued existence of the
  empire is the question of defence. A country of which <span
  class="sidenote">Imperial defence.</span> the main thoroughfares are the
  oceans of the world demands in the first instance a strong navy. It has
  of late years been accepted as a fundamental axiom of defence that the
  British navy should exceed in strength any reasonable combination of
  foreign navies which could be brought against it, the accepted formula
  being the "two-power standard," <i>i.e.</i> a 10% margin over the joint
  strength of the two next powers. The expense of maintaining such a
  floating armament must be colossal, and until within the decade 1890-1900
  it was borne exclusively by the taxpayers of the United Kingdom. As the
  benefits of united empire have become more consciously appreciated in the
  colonies, and the value of the fleet as an insurance for British commerce
  has been recognized, a desire has manifested itself on the part of the
  self-governing colonies to contribute towards the formation of a truly
  imperial navy. In 1895 the Australasian colonies voted a subsidy of
  £126,000 per annum for the maintenance of an Australasian squadron, and
  in 1897 the Cape Colony also offered a contribution of £30,000 a year to
  be used at the discretion of the imperial government for naval purposes.
  The Australian contribution was in 1902 increased to £240,000, and that
  of the Cape to £50,000, while Natal voted £35,000 a year and Newfoundland
  £3000. But apart from these comparatively slight contributions, and the
  local up-keep of colonial fortifications,&mdash;and the beginning in
  1908-1909 of an Australian torpedo-boat flotilla provided by the
  Commonwealth,&mdash;the whole cost of the imperial navy, on which
  ultimately the security of the empire rested, remained to be <!-- Page
  614 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page614"></a>[v.04
  p.0614]</span>borne by the taxpayers in the British islands. The extent
  of this burden was emphasized in 1909 by the revelations as to the
  increase of the German (and the allied Austrian) fleet. At this crisis in
  the history of the two-power standard a wave of enthusiasm started in the
  colonies, resulting in the offer of "Dreadnoughts" from New Zealand and
  elsewhere; and the British government called an Imperial Conference to
  consider the whole question afresh.</p>

  <p>Land defence, though a secondary branch of the great question of
  imperial defence, has been intimately connected with the development and
  internal growth of the empire. In the case of the first settlement of the
  American colonies they were expected to provide for their own land
  defence. To some extent in the early part of their career they carried
  out this expectation, and even on occasion, as in the taking of
  Louisburg, which was subsequently given back at the peace of
  Aix-la-Chapelle as the price of the French evacuation of Madras, rendered
  public service to the empire at large. In India the principle of local
  self-defence was from the beginning carried into practice by the East
  India Company. But in America the claim of the French wars proved too
  heavy for local resources. In 1755 Great Britain intervened with troops
  sent from home under General Braddock, and up to the outbreak of the
  American War the cost of the defence of the North American colonies was
  borne by the imperial exchequer. To meet this expense the imperial
  parliament took upon itself the right to tax the American colonies. In
  1765 a Quartering Act was passed by which 10,000 imperial troops were
  quartered in the colonies. As a result of the American War which followed
  and led to the loss of the colonies affected, the imperial authorities
  accepted the charge of the land defences of the empire, and with the
  exception of India and the Hudson Bay territories, where the trading
  companies determined to pay their own expenses, the whole cost of
  imperial defence was borne, like the cost of the navy, by the taxpayers
  of the United Kingdom. This condition of affairs lasted till the end of
  the Napoleonic Wars. During the thirty years' peace which followed there
  came time for consideration. The fiscal changes which towards the middle
  of the 19th century gave to the self-governing colonies the command of
  their own resources very naturally carried with them the consequence that
  a call should be made on colonial exchequers to provide for their own
  governing expenses. Of these defence is obviously one of the most
  essential. Coincidently, therefore, with the movements of free trade at
  home, the renunciation of what was known as the mercantile system and the
  accompanying grants of constitutional freedom to the colonies, a movement
  for the reorganization of imperial defence was set on foot. In the decade
  which elapsed between 1846 and 1856 the movement as regards the colonies
  was confined chiefly to calls made upon them to contribute to their own
  defence by providing barracks, fortifications, &amp;c., for the
  accommodation of imperial troops, and in some cases paying for the use of
  troops not strictly required for imperial purposes. In 1857 the
  Australian colonies agreed to pay the expenses of the imperial garrison
  quartered in Australia. This was a very wide step from the imperial
  attempt to tax the American colonies for a similar purpose in the
  preceding century. Nevertheless, in evidence given before a departmental
  committee in 1859, it was shown that at that time the colonies of Great
  Britain were free from almost every obligation of contributing either by
  personal service or money payment towards their own defence, and that the
  cost of military expenditure in the colonies in the preceding year had
  amounted in round figures to £4,000,000. A committee of the House of
  Commons sat in 1861 to consider the question, and in 1862 it was
  resolved, without a division, that "colonies exercising the right of
  self-government ought to undertake the main responsibility of providing
  for their own internal order and security, and ought to assist in their
  own external defence." The decision was accepted as the basis of imperial
  policy. The first effect was the gradual withdrawing of imperial troops
  from the self-governing colonies, together with the encouragement of the
  development of local military systems by the loan, when desired, of
  imperial military experts. A call was also made for larger military
  contributions from some of the crown colonies. The committee of 1859 had
  emphasized in its report the fact that the principal dependence of the
  colonies for defence is necessarily upon the British navy, and in 1865,
  exactly 100 years after the Quartering Act, which had been the cause of
  the troubles that led to the independence of the United States, a
  Colonial Naval Defence Act was passed which gave power to the colonies to
  provide ships of war, steamers, and volunteers for their own defence, and
  in case of necessity to place them at the disposal of the crown. In 1868
  the Canadian Militia Act gave the fully organized nucleus of a local army
  to Canada. In the same year the imperial troops were withdrawn from New
  Zealand, leaving the colonial militia to deal with the native war still
  in progress. In 1870 the last imperial troops were withdrawn from
  Australia, and in 1873 it was officially announced that military
  expenditure in the colonies was almost "wholly for imperial purposes." In
  1875 an imperial officer went to Australia to report for the Australian
  government upon Australian defence. The appointment in 1879 of a royal
  commission to consider the question of imperial defence, which presented
  its report in 1882, led to a considerable development and reorganization
  of the system of imperial fortifications. Coaling stations were also
  selected with reference to the trade routes. In 1885 rumours of war
  roused a very strong feeling in connexion with the still unfinished and
  in many cases unarmed condition of the fortifications recommended by the
  commission of 1879. Military activity was stimulated throughout the
  empire, and the Colonial Defence Committee was created to supply a
  much-felt need for organized direction and advice to colonial
  administrations acting necessarily in independence of each other. The
  question of colonial defence was among the most important of the subjects
  discussed at the colonial conference held in London in 1887, and it was
  at this conference that the Australasian colonies first agreed to
  contribute to the expense of their own naval defence. From this date the
  principle of local responsibility for self-defence has been fully
  accepted. India has its own native army, and pays for the maintenance
  within its frontiers of an imperial garrison. Early in the summer of
  1899, when hostilities in South Africa appeared to be imminent, the
  governments of the principal colonies took occasion to express their
  approval of the South African policy pursued by the imperial government,
  and offers were made by the governments of India, the Australasian
  colonies, Canada, Hong-Kong, the Federal Malay states, some of the West
  African and other colonies, to send contingents for active service in the
  event of war. On the outbreak of hostilities these offers, on the part of
  the self-governing colonies, were accepted, and colonial contingents
  upwards of 30,000 strong were among the most efficient sections of the
  British fighting force. The manner in which these colonial contingents
  were raised, their admirable fighting qualities, and the service rendered
  by them in the field, disclosed altogether new possibilities of military
  organization within the empire, and in subsequent years the subject
  continued to engage the attention of the statesmen of the empire.
  Progress in this field lay chiefly in the increased support given in the
  colonial states to the separate local movements for self-defence; but in
  1909 a scheme was arranged by Mr Haldane, by which the British War Office
  should co-operate with the colonial governments in providing for the
  training of officers and an interchange of views on a common military
  policy.</p>

  <p>The important questions of justice, religion and instruction will be
  found dealt with in detail under the headings of separate <span
  class="sidenote">Justice, &amp;c.</span> sections of the empire. Systems
  of justice throughout the empire have a close resemblance to each other,
  and the judicial committee of the privy council, on which the
  self-governing colonies and India are represented, constitutes a supreme
  court of appeal (<i>q.v.</i>) for the entire empire. In the matter of
  religion, while no imperial organization in the strict sense is possible,
  the progress made by the Lambeth Conferences and otherwise (see <span
  class="sc">Anglican Communion</span>) has done much to bring the work of
  the Church of England in different parts of the world into a co-operative
  system. Religion, of which the forms are infinitely varied, is however
  everywhere free, <!-- Page 615 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page615"></a>[v.04 p.0615]</span>except in cases where the exercise
  of religious rites leads to practices foreign to accepted laws of
  humanity. It is perhaps interesting to state that the number of persons
  in the empire nominally professing the Christian religion is 58,000,000,
  of Mahommedans 94,000,000, of Buddhists 12,000,000, of Hindus
  208,000,000, of pagans and others 25,000,000. Systems of instruction, of
  which the aim is generally similar in the white portions of the empire
  and is directed towards giving to every individual the basis of a liberal
  education, are governed wholly by local requirements. Native schools are
  established in all settled communities under British rule.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;In recent years the subject
  of British imperialism has inspired a growing literature, and it is only

  <p><b>BRITISH HONDURAS</b>, formerly called <span
  class="sc">Balize</span>, or <span class="sc">Belize</span>, a British
  crown colony in Central America; bounded on the N. and N.W. by the
  Mexican province of Yucatan, N.E. and E. by the Bay of Honduras, an inlet
  of the Caribbean Sea, and S. and W. by Guatemala. (For map, see <span
  class="sc">Central America</span>.) Pop. (1905) 40,372; area, 7562 sq. m.
  The frontier of British Honduras, as defined by the conventions of 1859
  and 1893 between Great Britain and Guatemala, begins at the mouth of the
  river Sarstoon or Sarstun, in the Bay of Honduras; ascends that river as
  far as the rapids of Gracias à Dios; and thence, turning to the right,
  runs in a straight line to Garbutt's Rapids, on the Belize river. From
  this point it proceeds due north to the Mexican frontier, where it
  follows the river Hondo to its mouth in Chetumal Bay.</p>

  <p>British Honduras differs little from the rest of the Yucatan
  peninsula. The approach to the coast is through the islets known as cays,
  and through coral reefs. It is both difficult and dangerous. For some
  miles inland the ground is low and swampy, thickly covered with mangroves
  and tropical jungle. Next succeeds a narrow belt of rich alluvial land,
  not exceeding a mile in width, beyond which, and parallel to the rivers,
  are vast tracts of sandy, arid land, called "pine ridges," from the red
  pines with which they are covered. Farther inland these give place,
  first, to the less elevated "broken ridges," and then to what are called
  "cahoon ridges," with a deep rich soil covered with myriads of palm
  trees. Next come broad savannas, studded with clumps of, trees, through
  which the streams descending from the mountains wind in every direction.
  The mountains themselves rise in a succession of ridges parallel to the
  coast. The first are the Manatee Hills, from 800 to 1000 ft. high; and
  beyond these are the Cockscomb Mountains, which are about 4000 ft. high.
  No less than sixteen streams, large enough to be called rivers, descend
  from these mountains to the sea, between the Hondo and Sarstoon. The
  uninhabited country between Garbutt's Rapids and the coast south of Deep
  river was first explored in 1879, by Henry Fowler, the colonial secretary
  of British Honduras; it was then found to consist of open and undulating
  grasslands, affording fine pasturage in the west and of forests full of
  valuable timber in the east. Its elevation varies from 1200 to 3300 ft.
  Auriferous quartz and traces of other minerals have been discovered, but
  not in sufficient quantity to repay the cost of mining. The geology,
  fauna and flora of British Honduras do not materially differ from those
  of the neighbouring regions (see <span class="sc">Central
  America</span>).</p>

  <p>Although the colony is in the tropics, its climate is subtropical. The
  highest shade temperature recorded is 98° F., the lowest 50°. Easterly
  sea-winds prevail during the greater part of the year. The dry season
  lasts from the middle of February to the middle of May; rain occurs at
  intervals during the other months, and almost continuously in October,
  November and December. The annual rainfall averages about 81½ in., but
  rises in some districts to 150 in. or more. Cholera, yellow fever and
  other tropical diseases occur sporadically, but, on the whole, the
  country is not unhealthy by comparison with the West Indies or Central
  American states.</p>

  <p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;British Honduras is a little larger than
  Wales, and has a population smaller than that of Chester (England). In
  1904 the inhabitants of European descent numbered 1500, the Europeans
  253, and the white Americans 118. The majority belong to the hybrid race
  descended from negro slaves, aboriginal Indians and white settlers. At
  least six distinct racial groups can be traced. These consist of (1)
  native Indians, to be found chiefly in forest villages in the west and
  north of the colony away from the sea coast; (2) descendants of the
  English buccaneers, mixed with Scottish and German traders; (3) the
  woodcutting class known as "Belize Creoles," of more or less pure descent
  from African negroes imported, as slaves or as labourers, from the West
  Indies; (4) the Caribs of the southern districts, descendants of the
  population deported in 1796 from St Vincent, who were of mixed African
  and Carib origin; (5) a mixed population in the south, of Spanish-Indian
  origin, from Guatemala and Honduras; and (6) in the north another
  Spanish-Indian group which came from Yucatan in 1848. The population
  tends slowly to increase; about 45% of the births are illegitimate, and
  males are more numerous than females. Many tracts of fallow land and
  forest were once thickly populated, for British Honduras has its ruined
  cities, and other traces of a lost Indian civilization, in common with
  the rest of Central America.</p>

  <p><i>Natural Products.</i>&mdash;-For more than two centuries British
  Honduras has been supported by its trade in timber, especially in
  mahogany, logwood, cedar and other dye-woods and cabinet-woods, such as
  lignum-vitae, fustic, bullet-wood, santa-maria, ironwood, rosewood,
  &amp;c. The coloured inhabitants are unsurpassed as woodmen, and averse
  from agriculture; so that there are only about 90 sq. m. of tilled land.
  Sugar-cane, bananas, cocoanut-palms, plantains, and various other fruits
  are cultivated; vanilla, sarsaparilla, sapodilla or chewing-gum, rubber,
  and the cahoon or coyol palm, valuable for its oil, grow wild in large
  quantities. In September 1903 all the pine trees on crown lands were sold
  to Mr B. Chipley, a citizen of the United States, at one cent (½ d.) per
  tree; the object of the sale being to secure the opening up of
  undeveloped territory. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to establish
  sponge fisheries on a large scale.</p>

  <p><i>Chief Towns and Communications.</i>&mdash;Belize (pop. in 1904,
  9969), the capital and principal seaport, is described in a separate
  article. Other towns are Stann Creek (2459), Corosal (1696), Orange Walk
  (1244), Punta Gorda (706), the Cayo (421), Monkey River (384) and Mullins
  River (243). All these are administered by local boards, whose aggregate
  revenue amounts to some £7000. Telegraph and telephone lines connect the
  capital with Corosal in the north, and Punta Gorda in the south; but
  there are no railways, and few good roads beyond municipal limits. Thus
  the principal means of communication are the steamers which ply along the
  coast. Mail steamers from New Orleans, Liverpool, Colon and Puerto Cortes
  in Honduras, regularly visit Belize.</p>

  <p><i>Commerce and Finance.</i>&mdash;Between 1901 and 1905 the tonnage
  of vessels accommodated at the ports of British Honduras rose from
  300,000 to 496,465; the imports rose from £252,500 to £386,123; the
  exports from £285,500 to £377,623. The exports consist of the timber,
  fruit and other vegetable products already mentioned, besides rum,
  deerskins, tortoiseshell, turtles and sponges, while the principal
  imports are cotton goods, hardware, beer, wine, spirits, groceries and
  specie. The sea-borne trade is mainly shared by Great Britain and the
  United States. On the 14th of October 1894, the American gold dollar was
  adopted as the standard coin, in place of the Guatemalan dollar; and the
  silver of North, South and Central America ceased to be legal tender.
  Government notes are issued to the value of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100
  dollars, and there is a local currency of one cent bronze pieces, and of
  5, 10, 25 and 50 cent silver pieces. The British sovereign and half
  sovereign are legal tender. In 1846 the government savings bank was
  founded in Belize; branches were afterwards opened in the principal
  towns; and in 1903 the British Bank of Honduras was established at
  Belize. The revenue, chiefly derived from customs, rose from £60,150 in
  1901 to £68,335 in 1905. The expenditure, in which the cost of police
  <!-- Page 616 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page616"></a>[v.04
  p.0616]</span>and education are important items, rose, during the same
  period, from £51,210 to £61,800. The public debt, amounting in 1905 to
  £34,736, represents the balance due on three loans which were raised in
  1885, 1887, and 1891, for public works in Belize. The loans are repayable
  between 1916 and 1923.</p>

  <p><i>Constitution and Administration.</i>&mdash;From 1638 to 1786 the
  colonists were completely independent, and elected their own magistrates,
  who performed all judicial and executive functions. The customs and
  precedents thus established were codified and published under the name of
  "Burnaby's Laws," after the visit of Admiral Sir W. Burnaby, in 1756, and
  were recognized as valid by the crown. In 1786 a superintendent was
  appointed by the home government, and although this office was vacant
  from 1790 to 1797, it was revived until 1862. An executive council was
  established in 1839, and a legislative assembly, of three nominated and
  eighteen elected members, in 1853. British Honduras was declared a colony
  in 1862, with a lieutenant governor, subject to the governor of Jamaica,
  as its chief magistrate. In 1870 the legislative assembly was abolished,
  and a legislative council substituted&mdash;the constitution of this body
  being fixed, in 1892, at three official and five unofficial members. In
  1884 the lieutenant governor was created governor and commander-in-chief,
  and rendered independent of Jamaica. He is assisted by an executive
  council of three official and three unofficial members. For
  administrative purposes the colony is divided into six
  districts&mdash;Belize, Corosal, Orange Walk, the Cayo, Stann Creek and
  Toledo. The capital of the last named is Punta Gorda; the other districts
  take the names of their chief towns. English common law is valid
  throughout British Honduras, subject to modification by local enactments,
  and to the operation of the <i>Consolidated Laws of British Honduras</i>.
  This collection of ordinances, customs, &amp;c., was officially revised
  and published between 1884 and 1888. Appeals may be carried before the
  privy council or the supreme court of Jamaica,</p>

  <p><i>Religion and Education.</i>&mdash;The churches represented are
  Roman Catholic, Anglican, Wesleyan, Baptist and Presbyterian; but none of
  them receives assistance from public funds. The bishopric of British
  Honduras is part of the West Indian province of the Church of England.
  Almost all the schools, secondary as well as primary, are denominational.
  School fees are charged, and grants-in-aid are made to elementary
  schools. Most of these, since 1894, have been under the control of a
  board, on which the religious bodies managing the schools are
  represented.</p>

  <p><i>Defence.</i>&mdash;The Belize volunteer light infantry corps,
  raised in 1897, consists of about 200 officers and men; a mounted
  section, numbering about 40, was created in 1904. For the whole colony,
  the police Dumber about 120. There is also a volunteer fire brigade of
  335 officers and men.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;"His Majesty's Settlement in the Bay of
  Honduras," as the territory was formerly styled in official documents,
  owes, its origin, in 1638, to log-wood cutters who had formerly been
  buccaneers. These were afterwards joined by agents of the Chartered
  Company which exploited the pearl fisheries of the Mosquito coast.
  Although thus industriously occupied, the settlers so far retained their
  old habits as to make frequent descents on the logwood establishments of
  the Spaniards, whose attempts to expel them were generally successfully
  resisted. The most formidable of these was made by the Spaniards in April
  1754, when, in consequence of the difficulty of approaching the position
  from the sea, an expedition, consisting of 1500 men, was organized inland
  at the town of Peten. As it neared the coast, it was met by 250 British,
  and completely routed. The log-wood cutters were not again disturbed for
  a number of years, and their position had become so well established
  that, in the treaty of 1763 with Spain, Great Britain, while agreeing to
  demolish "all fortifications which English subjects had erected in the
  Bay of Honduras," insisted on a clause in favour of the cutters of
  logwood, that "they or their Workmen were not to be disturbed or
  molested, under any pretext whatever, in their said places of cutting and
  loading logwood." Strengthened by the recognition of the crown, the
  British settlers made fresh encroachments on Spanish territory. The
  Spaniards, asserting that they were engaged in smuggling and other
  illicit practices, organized a large force, and on the 15th of September
  1779, suddenly attacked and destroyed the establishment at Belize, taking
  the inhabitants prisoners to Mérida in Yucatan, and afterwards to Havana,
  where most of them died, The survivors were liberated in 1782, and
  allowed to go to Jamaica. In 1783 they returned with many new
  adventurers, and were soon engaged in cutting woods. On the 3rd of
  September in that year a new treaty was signed between Great Britain and
  Spain, in which it was expressly agreed that his Britannic Majesty's
  subjects should have "the right of cutting, loading, and carrying away
  logwood in the district lying between the river Wallis or Belize and Rio
  Hondo, taking the course of these two rivers for unalterable boundaries."
  These concessions "were not to be considered as derogating from the
  rights of sovereignty of the king of Spain" over the district in
  question, where all the English dispersed in the Spanish territories were
  to concentrate themselves within eighteen months. This did not prove a
  satisfactory arrangement; for in 1786 a new treaty was concluded, in
  which the king of Spain made an additional grant of territory, embracing
  the area between the rivers Sibun or Jabon and Belize. But these extended
  limits were coupled with still more rigid restrictions. It is not to be
  supposed that a population composed of so lawless a set of men was
  remarkably exact in its observance of the treaty. They seem to have
  greatly annoyed their Spanish neighbours, who eagerly availed themselves
  of the breaking out of war between the two countries in 1796 to concert a
  formidable attack on Belize. They concentrated a force of 2000 men at
  Campeachy, which, under the command of General O'Neill, set sail in
  thirteen vessels for Belize, and arrived on the 10th of July, 1798. The
  settlers, aided by the British sloop of war "Merlin," had strongly
  fortified a small island in the harbour, called St George's Cay. They
  maintained a determined resistance against the Spanish forces, which were
  obliged to retire to Campeachy. This was the last attempt to dislodge the
  British.</p>

  <p>The defeat of the Spanish attempt of 1798 has been adduced as an act
  of conquest, thereby permanently establishing British sovereignty. But
  those who take this view overlook the important fact that, in 1814, by a
  new treaty with Spain, the provisions of the earlier treaty were revived.
  They forget also that for many years the British government never laid
  claim to any rights acquired in virtue of the successful defence; for so
  late as 1817-1819 the acts of parliament relating to Belize always refer
  to it as "a settlement, for certain purposes, under the protection of His
  Majesty." After Central America had attained its independence (1819-1822)
  Great Britain secured its position by incorporating the provisions of the
  treaty of 1786 in a new treaty with Mexico (1826), and in the drafts of
  treaties with New Granada (1825) and the United States of Central America
  (1831). The territories between the Belize and Sarstoon rivers were
  claimed by the British in 1836. The subsequent peaceful progress of the
  country under British rule; the exception of Belize from that provision
  of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty (<i>q.v.</i>) of 1850 which forbade Great
  Britain and the United States to fortify or colonize any point on the
  Central American mainland; and the settlement of the boundary disputes
  with Guatemala in 1859, finally confirmed the legal sovereignty of Great
  Britain over the whole colony, including the territories claimed in 1836.
  The Bay Islands were recognized as part of the republic of Honduras in
  1859. Between 1849, when the Indians beyond the Hondo rose against their
  Mexican rulers, and 1901, when they were finally subjugated, rebel bands
  occasionally attacked the northern and north-western marches of the
  colony. The last serious raid was foiled in 1872.</p>

  <p><b>BRITOMARTIS</b> ("sweet maiden"), an old Cretan goddess, later
  identified with Artemis. According to Callimachus (<i>Hymn to Diana</i>,
  190), she was a nymph, the daughter of Zeus and Carme, and a favourite
  companion of Artemis. Being pursued by Minos, king of Crete, who was
  enamoured of her, she sprang from a rock into the sea, but was saved from
  drowning by falling into some fishermen's nets. She was afterwards made a
  goddess by Artemis under the name of Dictynna (<span title="diktuon" class="grk"
  >&delta;&#x1F77;&kappa;&tau;&upsilon;&omicron;&nu;</span>, "a <!-- Page
  617 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page617"></a>[v.04
  p.0617]</span>net"). She was the patroness of hunters, fishermen and
  sailors, and also a goddess of birth and health. The centre of her
  worship was Cydonia, whence it extended to Sparta and Aegina (where she
  was known as Aphaea) and the islands of the Mediterranean. By some she is
  considered to have been a moon-goddess, her flight from Minos and her
  leap into the sea signifying the revolution and disappearance of the moon
  (Pausanias ii. 30, iii. 14; Antoninus Liberalis 40).</p>

  <p><b>BRITON-FERRY,</b> a seaport in the mid-parliamentary division of
  Glamorganshire, Wales, on the eastern bank of the estuary of the Neath
  river in Swansea Bay, with stations on the Great Western and the Rhondda
  &amp; Swansea Bay railways, being 174 m. by rail from London. Pop. of
  urban district (1901) 6973. A tram-line connects it with Neath, 2 m.
  distant, and the Vale of Neath Canal (made in 1797) has its terminus
  here. The district was formerly celebrated for its scenery, but this has
  been considerably marred by industrial development which received its
  chief impetus from the construction in 1861 of a dock of 13 acres, the
  property of the Great Western Railway Company, and the opening up about
  the same time of the mining districts of Glyncorrwg and Maesteg by means
  of the South Wales mineral railway, which connects them with the dock and
  supplies it with its chief export, coal. Steel and tinplates are
  manufactured here on a large scale. There are also iron-works and a
  foundry.</p>

  <p>The name La Brittone was given by the Norman settlers of the 12th
  century to its ferry across the estuary of the Neath (where Archbishop
  Baldwin and Giraldus crossed in 1188, and which is still used), but the
  Welsh name of the town from at least the 16th century has been
  Llansawel.</p>

  <p><b>BRITTANY</b>, or <span class="sc">Britanny</span> (Fr.
  <i>Bretagne</i>), known as Armorica (<i>q.v.</i>) until the influx of
  Celts from Britain, an ancient province and duchy of France, consisting
  of the north-west peninsula, and nearly corresponding to the departments
  of Finistère, Côtes-du-Nord, Morbihan, Ille-et-Vilaine and Lower Loire.
  It is popularly divided into Upper or Western, and Lower or Eastern
  Brittany. Its greatest length between the English Channel and the
  Atlantic Ocean is 250 kilometres (about 155 English miles), and its
  superficial extent is 30,000 sq. kilometres (about 18,630 English sq.
  m.). It comprises two distinct zones, a maritime zone and an inland zone.
  In the centre there are two plateaus, partly covered with <i>landes</i>,
  unproductive moorland: the southern plateau is continued by the Montagnes
  Noires, and the northern is dominated by the Monts d'Arrée. These ranges
  nowhere exceed 1150 ft. in height, but from their wild nature they recall
  the aspect of high mountains. The waterways of Brittany are for the most
  part of little value owing to their torrent-like character. The only
  river basin of any importance is that of the Vilaine, which flows through
  Rennes. The coast is very much indented, especially along the English
  Channel, and is rocky and lined with reefs and islets. The mouths of the
  rivers form deep estuaries. Thus nature itself condemned Brittany to
  remain for a long time shut out from civilization. But in the 19th
  century the development of railways and other means of communication drew
  Brittany from its isolation. In the 19th century also agriculture
  developed in a remarkable manner. Many of the <i>landes</i> were cleared
  and converted into excellent pasturage, and on the coast market-gardening
  made great progress. In the fertile districts cereals too are cultivated.
  Industrial pursuits, except in a few seaport towns, which are rather
  French than Breton, have hitherto received but little attention.</p>

  <p>The Bretons are by nature conservative. They cling with almost equal
  attachment to their local customs and their religious superstitions. It
  was not till the 17th century that paganism was even nominally abolished
  in some parts, and there is probably no district in Europe where the
  popular Christianity has assimilated more from earlier creeds. Witchcraft
  and the influence of fairies are still often believed in. The costume of
  both sexes is very peculiar both in cut and colour, but varies
  considerably in different districts. Bright red, violet and blue are much
  used, not only by the women, but in the coats and waistcoats of the men.
  The reader will find full illustrations of the different styles in
  Bouet's <i>Breiz-izel, ou vie des Breions de l'Armorique</i> (1844). The
  Celtic language is still spoken in lower Brittany. Four dialects are
  pretty clearly marked (see the article <span class="sc">Celt</span>:
  <i>Language</i>, "<i>Breton</i>," p. 328). Nowhere has the taste for
  marvellous legends been kept so green as in Brittany; and an entire
  folk-literature still flourishes there, as is manifested by the large
  number of folk-tales and folk-songs which have been collected of late
  years.</p>

  <p>The whole duchy was formerly divided into nine
  bishoprics:&mdash;Rennes, Dol, Nantes, St Malo and St Brieuc, in Upper
  Brittany and Tréguier, Vannes, Quimper and St Pol de Léon in Lower.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Of Brittany before the coming of the Romans we
  have no exact knowledge. The only traces left by the primitive
  populations are the megalithic monuments (dolmens, menhirs and
  cromlechs), which remain to this day in great numbers (see <span
  class="sc">Stone Monuments</span>). In 56 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  the Romans destroyed the fleet of the Veneti, and in 52 the inhabitants
  of Armorica took part in the great insurrection of the Gauls against
  Caesar, but were subdued finally by him in 51. Roman civilization was
  then established for several centuries in Brittany.</p>

  <p>In the 5th century numbers of the Celtic inhabitants of Britain,
  flying from the Angles and Saxons, emigrated to Armorica, and populated a
  great part of the peninsula. Converted to Christianity, the new-comers
  founded monasteries which helped to clear the land, the greater part of
  which was barren and wild. The Celtic immigrants formed the counties of
  Vannes, Cornouaille, Léon and Domnonée. A powerful aristocracy was
  constituted, which owned estates and had them cultivated by serfs or
  villeins. The Celts sustained a long struggle against the Frankish kings,
  who only nominally occupied Brittany. Louis the Pious placed a native
  chief Nomenoë at the head of Brittany. There was then a fairly long
  period of peace; but Nomenoë rebelled against Charles the Bald, defeated
  him, and forced him, in 846, to recognize the independence of Brittany.
  The end of the 9th century and the beginning of the 10th were remarkable
  for the invasions of the Northmen. On several occasions they were driven
  back&mdash;by Salomon (d. 874) and afterwards by Alain, count of Vannes
  (d. 907)&mdash;but it was Alain Barbetorte (d. 952) who gained the
  decisive victory over them.</p>

  <p>In the second half of the 10th century and in the 11th century the
  counts of Rennes were predominant in Brittany. Geoffrey, son of Conan,
  took the title of duke of Brittany in 992. Conan II., Geoffrey's
  grandson, threatened by the revolts of the nobles, was attacked also by
  the duke of Normandy (afterwards William I. of England). Alain Fergent,
  one of his successors, defeated William in 1085, and forced him to make
  peace. But in the following century the Plantagenets succeeded in
  establishing themselves in Brittany. Conan IV., defeated by the revolted
  Breton nobles, appealed to Henry II. of England, who, in reward for his
  help, forced Conan to give his daughter in marriage to his son Geoffrey.
  Thus Henry II. became master of Brittany, and Geoffrey was recognized as
  duke of Brittany. But this new dynasty was not destined to last long.
  Geoffrey's posthumous son, Arthur, was assassinated by John of England in
  1203, and Arthur's sister Alix, who succeeded to his rights, was married
  in 1212 to Pierre de Dreux, who became duke. This was the beginning of a
  ducal dynasty of French origin, which lasted till the end of the 15th
  century.</p>

  <p>From that moment the ducal power gained strength in Brittany and
  succeeded in curbing the feudal nobles. Under French influence
  civilization made notable progress. For more than a century peace reigned
  undisturbed in Brittany. But in 1341 the death of John III., without
  direct heir, provoked a war of succession between the houses of Blois and
  Montfort, which lasted till 1364. This war of succession was, in reality,
  an incident of the Hundred Years' War, the partisans of Blois and
  Montfort supporting respectively the kings of France and England. In 1364
  John of Montfort (d. 1399) was recognized as duke of Brittany under the
  style of John IV.<a name="FnAnchor_141"
  href="#Footnote_141"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, but his reign <!-- Page 618
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page618"></a>[v.04 p.0618]</span>was
  constantly troubled, notably by his struggle with Olivier de Clisson
  (1336-1407). John V. (d. 1442), on the other hand, distinguished himself
  by his able and pacific policy. During his reign and the reigns of his
  successors, Francis I., Peter II. and Arthur III., the ducal authority
  developed in a remarkable manner. The dukes formed a standing army, and
  succeeded in levying hearth taxes (<i>fouages</i>) throughout Brittany.
  Francis II. (1435-1488) fought against Louis XI., notably during the War
  of the Public Weal, and afterwards engaged in the struggle against
  Charles VIII., known as "The Mad War" (<i>La Guerre Folle</i>). After the
  death of Francis II. the king of France invaded Brittany, and forced
  Francis's daughter, Anne of Brittany, to marry him in 1491. Thus the
  reunion of Brittany and France was prepared. After the death of Charles
  VIII. Anne married Louis XII. Francis I., who married Claude, the
  daughter of Louis XII. and Anne, settled the definitive annexation of the
  duchy by the contract of 1532, by which the maintenance of the privileges
  and liberties of Brittany was guaranteed. Until the Revolution Brittany
  retained its own estates. The royal power, however, was exerted to reduce
  the privileges of the province as much as possible. It often met with
  vigorous resistance, notably in the 18th century. The struggle was
  particularly keen between 1760 and 1769, when E. A. de V. du Plessis
  Richelieu, duc d'Aiguillon, had to fight simultaneously the estates and
  the parliament, and had a formidable adversary in L. R. de C. de la
  Chalotais. But under the monarchy the only civil war in Brittany in which
  blood was shed was the revolt of the duc de Merc&oelig;ur (d. 1602)
  against the crown at the time of the troubles of the League, a revolt
  which lasted from 1589 to 1598. Mention, however, must also be made of a
  serious popular revolt which broke out in 1675&mdash;"the revolt of the
  stamped paper."</p>

  <p><b>BRITTON, JOHN</b> (1771-1857), English antiquary, was born on the
  7th of July 1771 at Kington-St-Michael, near Chippenham. His parents were
  in humble circumstances, and he was left an orphan at an early age. At
  sixteen he went to London and was apprenticed to a wine merchant.
  Prevented by ill-health from serving his full term, he found himself
  adrift in the world, without money or friends. In his fight with poverty
  he was put to strange shifts, becoming cellarman at a tavern and clerk to
  a lawyer, reciting and singing at a small theatre, and compiling a
  collection of common songs. After some slight successes as a writer, a
  Salisbury publisher commissioned him to compile an account of Wiltshire
  and, in conjunction with his friend Edward Wedlake Brayley, Britton
  produced <i>The Beauties of Wiltshire</i> (1801; 2 vols., a third added
  in 1825), the first of the series <i>The Beauties of England and
  Wales</i>, nine volumes of which Britton and his friend wrote. Britton
  was the originator of a new class of literary works. "Before his time,"
  says Digby Wyatt, "popular topography was unknown." In 1805 Britton
  published the first part of his <i>Architectural Antiquities of Great
  Britain</i> (9 vols., 1805-1814); and this was followed by <i>Cathedral
  Antiquities of England</i> (14 vols., 1814-1835). In 1845 a Britton Club
  was formed, and a sum of £1000 was subscribed and given to Britton, who
  was subsequently granted a civil list pension by Disraeli, then
  chancellor of the exchequer. Britton was an earnest advocate of the
  preservation of national monuments, proposing in 1837 the formation of a
  society such as the modern Society for the Preservation of Ancient
  Monuments. Britton himself supervised the reparation of Waltham Cross and
  Stratford-on-Avon church. He died in London on the 1st of January
  1857.</p>

  <p>Among other works with which Britton was associated either as author
  or editor are <i>Historical Account of Redcliffe Church, Bristol</i>
  (1813); <i>Illustrations of Fonthill Abbey</i> (1823); <i>Architectural
  Antiquities of Normandy</i>, with illustrations by Pugin (1825-1827);
  <i>Picturesque Antiquities of English Cities</i> (1830); and <i>History
  of the Palace and Houses of Parliament at Westminster</i> (1834-1836),
  the joint work of Britton and Brayley. He contributed much to the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> and other periodicals.</p>

  <p>His <i>Autobiography</i> was published in 1850. A <i>Descriptive
  Account of his Literary Works</i> was published by his assistant T.E.
  Jones.</p>

  <p><b>BRITTON,</b> the title of the earliest summary of the law of
  England in the French tongue, which purports to have been written by
  command of King Edward I. The origin and authorship of the work have been
  much disputed. It has been attributed to John le Breton, bishop of
  Hereford, on the authority of a passage found in some MSS. of the history
  of Matthew of Westminster; there are difficulties, however, involved in
  this theory, inasmuch as the bishop of Hereford died in 1275, whereas
  allusions are made in <i>Britton</i> to several statutes passed after
  that time, and more particularly to the well-known statute <i>Quia
  emptores terrarum</i>, which was passed in 1290. It was the opinion of
  Selden that the book derived its title from Henry de Bracton, the last of
  the chief justiciaries, whose name is sometimes spelled in the fine Rolls
  "Bratton" and "Bretton", and that it was a royal abridgment of Bracton's
  great work on the customs and laws of England, with the addition of
  certain subsequent statutes. The arrangement, however, of the two works
  is different, and but a small proportion of Bracton's work is
  incorporated in <i>Britton</i>. The work is entitled in an early MS. of
  the 14th century, which was once in the possession of Selden, and is now
  in the Cambridge university library, <i>Summa de legibus Anglie que
  vocatur Bretone</i>; and it is described as "a book called Bretoun" in
  the will of Andrew Horn, the learned chamberlain of the city of London,
  who bequeathed it to the chamber of the Guildhall in 1329, together with
  another book called <i>Mirroir des Justices</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Britton</i> was first printed in London by Robert Redman, without a
  date, probably about the year 1530. Another edition of it was printed in
  1640, corrected by E. Wingate. A third edition of it, with an English
  translation, was published at the University Press, Oxford, 1865, by F.
  M. Nichol. An English translation of the work without the Latin text had
  been previously published by R. Kelham in 1762.</p>

  <p><b>BRITZSKA,</b> or <span class="sc">Britska</span> (from the Polish
  <i>bryczka</i>; a diminutive of <i>bryka</i>, a goods-wagon), a form of
  carriage, copied in England from Austria early in the 19th century; as
  used in Poland and Russia it had four wheels, with a long wicker-work
  body constructed for reclining and a calash (hooded) top.</p>

  <p><b>BRIVE,</b> or <span class="sc">Brives-la-Gaillarde</span>, a town
  of south-central France, capital of an arrondissement in the department
  of Corrèze, 62 m. S.S.E. of Limoges on the main line of the Orléans
  railway from Paris to Montauban. Pop. (1906) town 14,954; commune 20,636.
  It lies on the left bank of the Corrèze in an ample and fertile plain,
  which is the meeting-place of important roads and railways. The
  <i>enceinte</i> which formerly surrounded the town has been replaced by
  shady boulevards, and a few wide thoroughfares have been made, but many
  narrow winding streets and ancient houses still remain. Outside the
  boulevards lie the modern quarters, also the fine promenade planted with
  plane trees which stretches to the Corrèze and contains the chief
  restaurants and the theatre. Here also is the statue of Marshal Guillaume
  Marie Anne Brune, who was a native of Brive. A fine bridge leads over the
  river to suburbs on its right bank. The public buildings are of little
  interest apart from the church of St Martin, which stands in the heart of
  the old town. It is a building of the 12th century in the Romanesque
  style of Limousin, with three narrow naves of almost equal height. The
  ecclesiastical seminary occupies a graceful mansion of the 16th century,
  with a façade, a staircase and fireplaces of fine Renaissance
  workmanship. Brive is the seat of a sub-prefect <!-- Page 619 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page619"></a>[v.04 p.0619]</span>and has a
  tribunal of first instance, a tribunal of commerce, a communal college
  and a school of industry. Its position makes it a market of importance,
  and it has a very large trade in the early vegetables and fruit of the
  valley of the Corrèze, and in grain, live-stock and truffles.
  Table-delicacies, paper, wooden shoes, hats, wax and earthenware are
  manufactured, and there are slate and millstone workings and
  dye-works.</p>

  <p>In the vicinity are numerous rock caves, many of them having been used
  as dwellings in prehistoric times. The best known are those of Lamouroux,
  excavated in stages in a vertical wall of rock, and four grotto-chapels
  resorted to by pilgrims in memory of St Anthony of Padua, who founded a
  Franciscan monastery at Brive in 1226. Under the Romans Brive was known
  as <i>Briva Curretiae</i> (bridge of the Corrèze). In the middle ages it
  was the capital of lower Limousin.</p>

  <p><b>BRIXEN</b> (Ital. <i>Bressanone</i>), a small city in the Austrian
  province of Tirol, and the chief town of the administrative district of
  Brixen. Pop. (1900) 5767. It is situated in the valley of the Eisack, at
  the confluence of that stream with the Rienz, and is a station on the
  Brenner railway, being 34 m. south-east of that pass, and 24 m.
  north-east of Botzen. The aspect of the city is very ecclesiastical; it
  is still the see of a bishop, and contains an 18th-century cathedral
  church, an episcopal palace and seminary, twelve churches and five
  monasteries. The see was founded at the end of the 8th century (possibly
  of the 6th century) at Säben on the rocky heights above the town of
  Klausen (some way to the south of Brixen), but in 992 was transferred to
  Brixen, which, perhaps a Roman station, became later a royal estate,
  under the name of <i>Prichsna</i>, and in 901 was given by Louis the
  Child to the bishop. In 1027 the bishop received from the emperor Conrad
  II. very extensive temporal powers, which he only lost to Austria in
  1803. The town was surrounded in 1030 by walls. In 1525 it was the scene
  of the first outbreak of the great peasants' revolt. About 5½ m. north of
  Brixen is the great fortress of Franzensfeste, built 1833-1838, to guard
  the route over the Brenner and the way to the east up the Pusterthal.</p>

  <p><b>BRIXHAM,</b> a seaport and market town in the Torquay parliamentary
  division of Devonshire, England, 33 m. S. of Exeter, on a branch of the
  Great Western railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 8092. The town is
  irregularly built on the cliffs to the south of Torbay, and its harbour
  is sheltered by a breakwater. Early in the 19th century it was an
  important military post, with fortified barracks on Berry Head. It is the
  headquarters of the Devonshire sea-fisheries, having also a large
  coasting trade. Shipbuilding and the manufacture of ropes, paint and
  sails are industries. There is excellent bathing, and Brixham is in
  favour as a seaside resort. St Mary's, the ancient parish church, has an
  elaborate 14th-century font and some monuments of interest. At the
  British Seamen's Orphans' home boys are fed, clothed and trained as
  apprentices for the merchant service. A statue commemorates the landing,
  in 1688, of William of Orange.</p>

  <p><i>Brixham Cave</i>, called also Windmill Hill Cavern, is a well-known
  ossiferous cave situated near Brixham, on the brow of a hill composed of
  Devonian limestone. It was discovered by chance in 1858, having been
  until then hermetically sealed by a mass of limestone breccia. Dr Hugh
  Falconer with the assistance of a committee of geologists excavated it.
  The succession of beds in descending order is as follows:&mdash;(1)
  Shingle consisting of pebbles of limestone, slate and other local rocks,
  with fragments of stalagmite and containing a few bones and worked
  flints. The thickness varies from five to sixteen feet. (2) Red cave
  earth with angular fragments of limestone, bones and worked flints, and
  having a thickness of 3 to 4 ft. (3) Remnants (<i>in situ</i>) of an old
  stalagmitic floor about nine inches thick. (4) Black peaty soil varying
  in thickness, the maximum being about a foot. (5) Angular debris fallen
  from above varying in thickness from one to ten feet. (6) Stalagmite with
  a few bones and antlers of reindeer, the thickness varying from one to
  fifteen inches. Of particular interest is the presence of patches or
  ledges of an old stalagmitic floor, three to four feet above the present
  floor. On the under-side, there are found attached fragments of limestone
  and quartz, showing that the shingle bed once extended up to it, and that
  it then formed the original floor. The shingle therefore stood some feet
  higher than it does now, and it is supposed that a shock or jar, such as
  that of an earthquake, broke up the stalagmite, and the pebbles and sand
  composing the shingle sunk deeper into the fissures in the limestone.
  This addition to the size of the cave was partially filled up by the cave
  earth. At a later period the fall of angular fragments at the entrance
  finally closed the cave, and it ceased to be accessible except to a few
  burrowing animals, whose remains are found above the second and newer
  stalagmite floor.</p>

  <p>The fauna of Brixham cavern closely resembles that of Kent's Hole. The
  bones of the bear, horse, rhinoceros, lion, elephant, hyena and of many
  birds and small rodents were unearthed. Altogether 1621 bones, nearly all
  broken and gnawed, were found; of these 691 belonged to birds and small
  rodents of more recent times. The implements are of a roughly-chipped
  type resembling those of the Mousterian period. From these structural and
  palaeontological evidences, geologists suppose that the formation of the
  cave was carried on simultaneously with the excavation of the valley;
  that the small streams, flowing down the upper ramifications of the
  valley, entered the western opening of the cave, and traversing the
  fissures in the limestone, escaped by the lower openings in the chief
  valley; and that the rounded pebbles found in the shingle bed were
  carried in by these streams. It would be only at times of drought that
  the cave was frequented by animals, a theory which explains the small
  quantity of animal remains in the shingle. The implements of man are
  relatively more common, seventeen chipped flints having been found. As
  the excavation of the valley proceeded, the level of the stream was
  lowered and its course diverted; the cave consequently became drier and
  was far more frequently inhabited by predatory animals. It was now
  essentially an animal den, the occasional visits of man being indicated
  by the rare occurrence of flint-implements. Finally, the cave became a
  resort of bears; the remains of 334 specimens, in all stages of growth,
  including even sucking cubs, being discovered.</p>

  <p><b>BRIZEUX, JULIEN AUGUSTE PÉLAGE</b> (1803-1858), French poet, was
  born at Lorient (Morbihan) on the 12th of September 1803. He belonged to
  a family of Irish origin, long settled in Brittany, and was educated for
  the law, but in 1827 he produced at the Théâtre Français a one-act verse
  comedy, <i>Racine</i>, in collaboration with Philippe Busoni. A journey
  to Italy in company with Auguste Barbier made a great impression on him,
  and a second visit (1834) resulted in 1841 in the publication of a
  complete translation of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> in <i>terza rima</i>.
  With <i>Primel el Nola</i> (1852) he included poems written under Italian
  influence, entitled <i>Les Ternaires</i> (1841), but in the rustic idyl
  of <i>Marie</i> (1836) turned to Breton country life; in <i>Les
  Bretons</i> (1845) he found his inspiration in the folklore and legends
  of his native province, and in <i>Telen-Aroor</i> (1844) he used the
  Breton dialect. His <i>Histoires poétiques</i> (1855) was crowned by the
  French Academy. His work is small in bulk, but is characterized by
  simplicity and sincerity. Brizeux was an ardent student of the philology
  and archaeology of Brittany, and had collected materials for a dictionary
  of Breton place-names He died at Montpellier on the 3rd of May 1858.</p>

  <p>His <i>&OElig;uvres complètes</i> (2 vols., 1860) were edited with a
  notice of the author by Saint-René Taillandier. Another edition appeared
  in 1880-1884 (4 vols.). A long list of articles on his work may be
  consulted in an exhaustive monograph, <i>Brizeux; sa vie et ses
  &oelig;uvres</i> (1898), by the abbé C. Lecigne.</p>

  <p><b>BROACH,</b> or <span class="sc">Bharuch</span>, an ancient city and
  modern district of British India, in the northern division of Bombay. The
  city is on the right bank of the Nerbudda, about 30 m. from the sea, and
  203 m. N. of Bombay. The area, including suburbs, occupies 2-1/6 sq. m.
  Pop. (1901) 42,896. The sea-borne trade is confined to a few coasting
  vessels. Handloom-weaving is almost extinct, but several cotton mills
  have been opened. There are also large flour-mills. Broach is the
  Barakacheva of the Chinese traveller Hsüan Tsang and the Barygaza of
  Ptolemy and Arrian. Upon the conquest of Gujarat by the Mahommedans, and
  the formation of the state of that name, Broach formed part of the new
  kingdom. On its overthrow by Akbar in 1572, it was annexed to the Mogul
  empire and governed by a Nawab. The Mahrattas became its masters in 1685,
  from which period it was held in subordination to the peshwa until 1772,
  when it was captured by a force under General Wedderburn (brother to Lord
  Loughborough), who was killed in the assault. In 1783 it was ceded by the
  British to Sindhia in acknowledgment of certain services. It was stormed
  in 1803 by a detachment commanded by Colonel Woodington, and was finally
  ceded to the East India Company by Sindhia under the treaty of Sarji
  Anjangaom.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">District of Broach</span> contains an area of
  1467 sq. m. Consisting chiefly of the alluvial plain at the mouth of the
  river Nerbudda, the land is rich and highly cultivated, and though it is
  without forests it is not wanting in trees. The district is well supplied
  with rivers, having in addition to the Nerbudda the Mahi in the north and
  the Kim in the south. The population comprises several distinct races or
  castes, who, while speaking a common dialect, Gujarati, inhabit separate
  villages. Thus there are Koli, Kunbi or Voro (Bora) villages, and others
  whose lands are almost entirely held and cultivated by high castes, such
  as Rajputs, Brahmans or Parsees. In 1901 the population was 291,763,
  showing a decrease of 15%, compared with an increase of 5% in the
  preceding decade. The principal crops are cotton, millet, wheat and
  pulse. Dealing in cotton is the chief industry, the dealers being
  organized in a gild. Besides the cotton mills in Broach city there are
  several factories for ginning and pressing cotton, some of them on a very
  large scale. The district is traversed throughout its length by the
  Bombay &amp; Baroda railway, which crosses the Nerbudda opposite Broach
  city on an iron-girder bridge of 67 spans. The district suffered severely
  from the famine of 1899-1900.</p>

  <p><b>BROACH</b> (Fr. <i>broche</i>, a pointed instrument, Med. Lat.
  <i>brocca</i>, cf. the Latin adjective <i>brochus</i> or <i>broccus</i>,
  projecting, used of teeth), a word, of which the doublet "brooch"
  (<i>q.v.</i>) has a special meaning, for many forms of pointed
  instruments, such as a bodkin, a wooden needle used in tapestry-making, a
  spit for roasting meat, and a tool, also called a "rimer," used with a
  wrench for enlarging or smoothing holes (see <span
  class="sc">Tool</span>). From the use of a similar instrument to tap
  casks, comes "to broach" or "tap" a cask. A particular use in
  architecture is that of "broach-spire," a term employed to designate a
  particular form of spire, found only in England, which takes its name
  from the stone roof of the lower portion. The stone spire being octagonal
  and the tower square on plan, there remained four angles to be covered
  over. This was done with a stone roof of slight pitch, compared with that
  of the spire, and it is the intersection of this roof with the octagonal
  faces of the spire which forms the broach.</p>

  <p><b>BROADSIDE,</b> sometimes termed <span class="sc">Broadsheet</span>,
  a single sheet of paper containing printed matter on one side only. The
  broadside seems to have been employed from the very beginning of printing
  for royal proclamations, papal indulgences and similar documents. England
  appears to have been its chief home, where it was used chiefly for
  ballads, particularly in the 16th century, but also as a means of
  political agitation and for personal statements of all kinds, especially
  for the dissemination of the dying speeches and confessions of criminals.
  It is prominent in the history of literature because, particularly during
  the later part of the 17th century, several important poems, by Dryden,
  Butler and others, originally appeared printed on the "broad side" of a
  sheet. The term is also used of the simultaneous discharge of the guns on
  one side of a ship of war.</p>

  <p><b>BROADSTAIRS,</b> a watering-place, in the Isle of Thanet
  parliamentary division of Kent, England, 3 m. S.E. of Margate, on the
  South-Eastern &amp; Chatham railway. Pop. of urban district, Broadstairs
  and St Peter's (1901) 6466. From 1837 to 1851 Broadstairs was a favourite
  summer resort of Charles Dickens, who, in a sketch called "Our English
  Watering-Place," described it as a place "left high and dry by the tide
  of years." This seaside village, with its "semicircular sweep of houses,"
  grew into a considerable town owing to the influx of summer visitors, for
  whose entertainment there are, besides the "Albion" mentioned by Dickens,
  numerous hotels and boarding-houses, libraries, a bathing establishment
  and a fine promenade. Dickens' residence was called Fort House, but it
  became known as Bleak House, through association with his novel of that
  name, though this was written after his last visit to Broadstairs in
  1851. Broadstairs has a small pier for fishing-boats, first built in the
  reign of Henry VIII. An archway leading down to the shore bears an
  inscription showing that it was erected by George Culmer in 1540, and not
  far off is the site of a chapel of the Virgin, to which ships were
  accustomed to lower their top-sails as they passed. St Peter's parish,
  lying on the landward side of Broadstairs, and included in the urban
  district, has a church dating from the 12th to the end of the 16th
  century. Kingsgate, on the North Foreland, north of Broadstairs on the
  coast, changed its name from St Bartholomew's Gate in honour of Charles
  II.'s landing here with the duke of York in 1683 on his way from London
  to Dover. Stonehouse, close by, now a preparatory school for boys, was
  the residence of Archbishop Tait, whose wife established the orphanage
  here.</p>

  <p><b>BROCA, PAUL</b> (1824-1880), French surgeon and anthropologist, was
  born at Sainte-Foy la Grande, Gironde, on the 28th of June 1824. He early
  developed a taste for higher mathematics, but circumstances decided him
  in adopting medicine as his profession. Beginning his studies at Paris in
  1841, he made rapid progress, becoming house-surgeon in 1844, assistant
  anatomical lecturer in 1846, and three years later professor of surgical
  anatomy. He had already gained a reputation by his pathological
  researches. In 1853 he was named fellow of the Faculty of Medicine, and
  in 1867 became member of the Academy of Medicine and professor of
  surgical pathology to the Faculty. During the years occupied in winning
  his way to the head of his profession he had published treatises of much
  value on cancer, aneurism and other subjects. It was in 1861 that he
  announced his discovery of the seat of articulate speech in the left side
  of the frontal region of the brain, since known as the convolution of
  Broca. But famous as he was as a surgeon, his name is associated most
  closely with the modern school of anthropology. Establishing the
  Anthropological Society of Paris in 1859, of which he was secretary till
  his death, he was practically the inventor of the modern science of
  craniology. He rendered distinguished service in the Franco-German War,
  and during the Commune by his organization and administration of the
  public hospitals. He founded <i>La Revue d'Anthropologie</i> in 1872, and
  it was in its pages that the larger portion of his writings appeared. In
  his last years Broca turned from his labours in the region of craniology
  to the exclusive study of the brain, in which his greatest triumphs were
  achieved (see <span class="sc">Aphasia</span>). He was decorated with the
  Legion of Honour in 1868, and was honorary fellow of the leading
  anatomical, biological and anthropological societies of the world. He
  died on the 9th of July 1880. A statue of him by Choppin was erected in
  1887 in front of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris.</p>

  <p><b>BROCADE</b>, the name usually given to a class of richly decorative
  shuttle-woven fabrics, often made in coloured silks and with or without
  gold and silver threads. Ornamental features in brocade are emphasized
  and wrought as additions to the main fabric, sometimes stiffening it,
  though more frequently producing on its face the effect of low relief.
  These additions present a distinctive appearance on the back of the stuff
  where <!-- Page 621 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page621"></a>[v.04

  <p>The Latin word <i>broccus</i> is related equally to the Italian
  <i>brocato</i>, the Spanish <i>brocar</i> and the French <i>brocarts</i>
  and <i>brocher</i>, and implies a form of stitching or broaching, so that
  textile fabrics woven with an appearance of stitching or broaching have
  consequently come to be termed "brocades." A Spanish document dated 1375
  distinguishes between <i>los draps d'or é d'argent o de seda</i> and
  <i>brocats d'or é d'argent</i>, a difference which is readily perceived,
  upon comparing for instance cloths of gold, Indian kincobs, with Lyons
  silks that are <i>brochés</i> with threads of gold, silk or other
  material. Notwithstanding this, many Indian kincobs and dainty gold and
  coloured silk-weavings of Persian workmanship, both without floating
  threads, are often called brocades, although in neither is the
  ornamentation really <i>broché</i> or brocaded. Contemporary in use with
  the Spanish <i>brocats</i> is the word <i>brocado</i>. In addition to
  <i>brocarts</i> the French now use the word <i>brocher</i> in connexion
  with certain silk stuffs which however are not brocades in the same sense
  as the <i>brocarts</i>. A wardrobe account of King Edward IV. (1480) has
  an entry of "satyn broched with gold"&mdash;a description that fairly
  applies to such an enriched satin as that for instance shown in fig. 4.
  But some three centuries earlier than the date of that specimen,
  decorative stuffs were partly <i>brochés</i> with gold threads by
  oriental weavers, especially those of Persia, Syria and parts of southern
  Europe and northern Africa under the domination of the Saracens, to whom
  the earlier germs, so to speak, of brocading may be traced. Of such is
  the 11th or 12th century Siculo-Saracenic specimen in fig. 1, in which
  the heads only of the pairs of animals and birds are broched with gold
  thread. Another sort of brocaded material is indicated in fig. 2, taken
  from a part of a sumptuous Siculo-Saracenic weaving produced in coloured
  silks and gold threads at the famous Hotel des Tiraz in Palermo for an
  official robe of Henry IV. (1165-1197) as emperor of the Holy Roman
  Empire, and still preserved in the cathedral of Regensburg. Fig. 3 is a
  further variety of textile that would be classed as <i>brocat</i>. This
  is of the 12th or 13th century manufacture, possibly by German or
  Rhenish-Byzantine weavers, or even by Spanish weavers, many of whom at
  Almeria, Malaga, Grenada and Seville rivalled those at Palermo. In the
  14th century the making of satins heavily brocaded with gold threads was
  associated conspicuously with such Italian towns as Lucca, Genoa, Venice
  and Florence. Fig. 4 is from a piece of 14th-century dark-blue satin
  broached in relief with gold thread in a design the like of which appears
  in the background of Orcagna's "Coronation of the Virgin," now in the
  National Gallery, London. During the 17th century Genoa, Florence and
  Lyons vied with each other in making brocades in which the enrichments
  were as frequently of coloured silks as of gold intermixed with silken
  threads. Fig. 5 is from a piece of crimson silk damask flatly brocaded
  with flowers, scroll forms, fruit and birds in gold. This is probably of
  Florentine workmanship. Rather more closely allied to modern brocades is
  the Lyons specimen given in fig. 6, in which the brocading is done not
  only with silver but also with coloured silks. Early in the 18th century
  Spitalfields was busy as a competitor with Lyons in manufacturing many
  sorts of brocades, specified in a collection of designs preserved in the
  national art library of the Victoria and <!-- Page 622 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page622"></a>[v.04 p.0622]</span>Albert Museum,
  under such trade titles as "brocade lutstring, brocade tabby, brocade
  tissue, brocade damask, brocade satin, Venetian brocade, and India
  figured brocade." Brocading in China seems to be of considerable
  antiquity, and Dr Bushell in his valuable handbook on Chinese art cites a
  notice of five rolls of brocade with dragons woven upon a crimson ground,
  presented by the emperor Ming Ti of the Wei dynasty, in the year <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 238, to the reigning empress of Japan; and
  varieties of brocade patterns are recorded as being in use during the
  Sung dynasty (960-1279). The first edition of an illustrated work upon
  tillage and weaving was published in China in 1210, and contains an
  engraving of a loom constructed to weave flowered-silk brocades such as
  are woven at the present time at Suchow and Hangchow and elsewhere. On
  the other hand, although they are described usually as brocades, certain
  specimens of imperial Chinese robes sumptuous in ornament, sheen of
  coloured silks and the glisten of golden threads, are woven in the
  tapestry-weaving manner and without any floating threads. It seems
  reasonable to infer that Persians and Syrians derived the art of weaving
  brocades from the Chinese, and as has been indicated, passed it on to
  Saracens as well as Europeans.</p>

  <p><b>BROCCHI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA</b> (1772-1826), Italian mineralogist
  and geologist, was born at Bassano on the 18th of February 1772. He
  studied at the university of Pisa, where his attention was turned to
  mineralogy and botany. In 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in
  the new lyceum of Brescia; but he more especially devoted himself to
  geological researches in the adjacent districts. The fruits of these
  labours appeared in different publications, particularly in his
  <i>Trattato mineralogico e chemico sulle miniere di ferro del
  dipartimento del Mella</i> (1808)&mdash;treatise on the iron mines of
  Mella. These researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in
  the recently established kingdom of Italy, and enabled him to extend his
  investigations over great part of the country. In 1811 he produced a
  valuable essay entitled <i>Memoria mineralogica sulla Valle di Fassa in
  Tirolo</i>; but his most important work is the <i>Conchiologia fossile
  subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli Apennini, e sul suolo
  adiacente</i> (2 vols., 4to, Milan, 1814), containing accurate details of
  the structure of the Apennine range, and an account of the fossils of the
  Italian Tertiary strata compared with existing species. These subjects
  were further illustrated by his geognostic map, and his <i>Catalogo
  ragionato di una raccolta di rocce, disposto con ordine geografico, per
  servire alla geognosia dell' Italia</i> (Milan, 1817). His work <i>Dello
  stato fisico del suolo di Roma</i> (1820), with its accompanying map, is
  likewise noteworthy. In it he corrected the erroneous views of Breislak,
  who conceived that Rome occupies the site of a volcano, to which he
  ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills. Brocchi
  pointed out that these materials were derived either from Mont Albano,
  <!-- Page 623 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page623"></a>[v.04
  p.0623]</span>an extinct volcano, 12 m. from the city, or from Mont
  Cimini, still farther to the north. Several papers by him, on
  mineralogical subjects, appeared in the <i>Biblioteca Italiana</i> from
  1816 to 1823. In the latter year Brocchi sailed for Egypt, in order to
  explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources.
  Every facility was granted by Mehemet Ali, who in 1823 appointed him one
  of a commission to examine the district of Sennaar; but Brocchi,
  unfortunately for science, fell a victim to the climate, and died at
  Khartum on the 25th of September 1826.</p>

  <p><b>BROCHANT DE VILLIERS, ANDRÉ JEAN FRANÇOIS MARIE</b> (1772-1840),
  French mineralogist and geologist, was born at Villiers, near Nantes, on
  the 6th of August 1772. After studying at the École Polytechnique, he was
  in 1794 the first pupil admitted to the École des Mines. In 1804 he was
  appointed professor of geology and mineralogy in the École des Mines,
  which had been temporarily transferred to Pezay in Savoy, and he returned
  with the school to Paris in 1815. Later on he became inspector general of
  mines and a member of the Academy of Sciences. He investigated the
  transition strata of the Tarantaise, wrote on the position of the granite
  rocks of Mont Blanc, and on the lead minerals of Derbyshire and

  of the geological map of France, undertaken by his pupils Dufrénoy and
  Elie de Beaumont. He died in Paris on the 16th of May 1840. His

  <p><b>BROCHANTITE,</b> a mineral species consisting of a basic copper
  sulphate Cu<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, crystallizing in
  the orthorhombic system. The crystals are usually small and are prismatic
  or acicular in habit; they have a perfect cleavage parallel to the face
  lettered a in the adjoining figure. They are transparent to translucent,
  with a vitreous lustre, and are of an emerald-green to blackish-green
  colour. Specific gravity 3.907; hardness 3½-4. The mineral was first
  found associated with malachite and native copper in the copper mines of
  the Urals, and was named by A. Lévy in 1824 after A.J.M. Brochant de
  Villiers. Several varieties, differing somewhat in crystalline form, have
  been distinguished, some of them having originally been described as
  distinct species, but afterwards proved to be essentially identical with
  brochantite; these are königine from the Urals, brongniartine from
  Mexico, krisuvigite from Iceland, and warringtonite from Cornwall. Of
  other localities, mention may be made of Roughten Gill, Caldbeck Fells,
  Cumberland, where small brilliant crystals are associated with malachite
  and chrysocolla in a quartzose rock; Rézbánya in the Bihar Mountains,
  Hungary; Atacama in Chile, with atacamite, which closely resembles
  brochantite in general appearance; the Tintic district in Utah. A
  microscopical examination of the green copper ores of secondary origin in
  the Clifton and Morenci district of Arizona proves brochantite to be of
  extremely common occurrence mostly intergrown with malachite which
  effectually masks its presence: it is not unlikely that the malachite of
  other localities will on examination be found to be intergrown with
  brochantite.</p>

  <p>Mention may be here made of another orthorhombic basic copper sulphate
  not unlike brochantite in general characters, but differing from it in
  containing water of crystallization and in its fine blue colour; this is
  the Cornish mineral langite, which has the composition
  CuSO<sub>4</sub>·3Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

  <p><b>BROCK, SIR ISAAC</b> (1769-1812), British soldier and
  administrator, was born at St Peter Port, Guernsey, on the 6th of October
  1769. Joining the army at the age of fifteen as an ensign of the 8th
  regiment, he became a lieutenant-colonel in 1797, after less than
  thirteen years' service. He commanded the 49th regiment in the expedition
  to North Holland in 1799, was wounded at the battle of Egmont-op-Zee, and
  subsequently served on board the British fleet at the battle of
  Copenhagen. From 1802 to 1805 he was with his regiment in Canada,
  returning thither in 1806 in view of the imminence of war between Great
  Britain and the United States. From September 1806 till August 1810 he
  was in charge of the garrison at Quebec; in the latter year he assumed
  the command of the troops in Upper Canada, and soon afterwards took over
  the civil administration of that province as provisional
  lieutenant-governor. On the outbreak of the war of 1812 Brock had to
  defend Upper Canada against invasion by the United States. In the face of
  many difficulties and not a little disaffection, he organized the militia
  of the province, drove back the invaders, and on the 16th of August 1812,
  with about 730 men and 600 Indians commanded by their chief Tecumseh,
  compelled the American force of 2500 men under General William Hull
  (1753-1825) to surrender at Detroit, an achievement which gained him a
  knighthood of the Bath and the popular title of "the hero of Upper
  Canada" From Detroit he hurried to the Niagara frontier, but on the 13th
  of October in the same year was killed at the battle of Queenston
  Heights. The House of Commons voted a public monument to his memory,
  which was erected in Saint Paul's cathedral, London. On the 13th of
  October 1824, the twelfth anniversary of his death, his remains were
  removed from the bastions of Fort George, where they had been originally
  interred, and placed beneath a monument on Queenston Heights, erected by
  the provincial legislature. This was blown up by a fanatic in 1840, but
  as the result of a mass-meeting of over 8000 citizens held on the spot, a
  new and more stately monument was erected.</p>

  <p>His <i>Life and Correspondence</i> by his nephew, Ferdinand Brock
  Tupper (2nd edition, London, 1847), still remains the best; later lives
  are by D.R. Read (Toronto, 1894), and by Lady Edgar (Toronto and
  London,1905).</p>

  <p><b>BROCK, THOMAS</b> (1847- ), English sculptor, was the chief pupil
  of Foley, and later became influenced by the new romantic movement. His
  group "The Moment of Peril" was followed by "The Genius of Poetry,"
  "Eve," and other ideal works that mark his development. His busts, such
  as those of Lord Leighton and Queen Victoria; his statues, such as "Sir
  Richard Owen" and "Dr Philpott, bishop of Worcester"; his sepulchral
  monuments, such as that to Lord Leighton in St Paul's cathedral, a work
  of singular significance, refinement and beauty; and his memorial statues
  of Queen Victoria, at Hove and elsewhere, are examples of his power as a
  portraitist, sympathetic in feeling, sound and restrained in execution,
  and dignified and decorative in arrangement. The colossal equestrian
  statue of "Edward the Black Prince" was set up in the City Square in
  Leeds in 1901, the year in which the sculptor was awarded the commission
  to execute the vast Imperial Memorial to Queen Victoria in front of
  Buckingham Palace. Brock was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in
  1883 and full member in 1891.</p>

  <p><b>BROCKEN,</b> a mountain of Germany, in Prussian Saxony, the highest
  point (3733 ft.) of the Harz. It is a huge, bare, granite-strewn,
  dome-shaped mass and, owing to its being the greatest elevation in north
  Germany, commands magnificent views in all directions. From it Magdeburg
  and the Elbe, the towers of Leipzig and the Thuringian forest are
  distinctly visible in clear weather. Access to the summit is attained by
  a mountain railway (12 m.) from Dreiannen-Hohne, a station on the normal
  gauge line Wernigerode-Nordhausen, and by two carriage roads from the
  Bodetal and Ilsenburg respectively. In the folklore of north Germany the
  Brocken holds an important place, and to it cling many legends. Long
  after Christianity had penetrated to these regions, the Brocken remained
  a place of heathen worship. Annually, on Walpurgis night (1st of May),
  curious rites were here enacted, which, condemned by the priests of the
  Christian church, led to the belief that the devil and witches here held
  their orgies. Even to this day, this superstition possesses the minds of
  many country people around, who believe the mountain to be haunted on
  this night. In literature <!-- Page 624 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page624"></a>[v.04 p.0624]</span>it is represented by the famous
  "Brocken scene" in Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.</p>

  and Pröhle, <i>Brockensagen</i> (Magdeburg, 1888).</p>

  <p><b>BROCKEN, SPECTRE OF THE</b> (so named from having been first
  observed in 1780 on the Brocken), an enormously magnified shadow of an

  regions, reproducing every motion of the observer in the form of a
  gigantic but misty image of himself.</p>

  <p><b>BROCKES, BARTHOLD HEINRICH</b> (1680-1747), German poet, was born
  at Hamburg on the 22nd of September 1680. He studied jurisprudence at
  Halle, and after extensive travels in Italy, France and Holland, settled
  in his native town in 1704. In 1720 he was appointed a member of the
  Hamburg senate, and entrusted with several important offices. Six years
  (from 1735 to 1741) he spent as <i>Amtmann</i> (magistrate) at
  Ritzebtütel. He died in Hamburg on the 16th of January 1747. Brockes'
  poetic works were published in a series of nine volumes under the
  fantastic title <i>Irdisches Vergnügen in Gott</i> (1721-1748); he also
  translated Marini's <i>La Strage degli innocenti</i> (1715), Pope's
  <i>Essay on Man</i> (1740) and Thomson's <i>Seasons</i> (1745). His
  poetry has small intrinsic value, but it is symptomatic of the change
  which came over German literature at the beginning of the 18th century.
  He was one of the first German poets to substitute for the bombastic
  imitations of Marini, to which he himself had begun by contributing, a
  clear and simple diction. He was also a pioneer in directing the
  attention of his countrymen to the new poetry of nature which originated
  in England. His verses, artificial and crude as they often are, express a
  reverential attitude towards nature and a religious interpretation of
  natural phenomena which was new to German poetry and prepared the way for
  Klopstock.</p>

  <p>Brockes' autobiography was published by J.M. Lappenberg in the
  <i>Zeitschrift des Vereins für Hamburger Geschichte,</i> ii. pp. 167 ff.
  (1847). See also A. Brandl, <i>B. H. Brockes</i> (1878), and D.F.
  Strauss, <i>Brockes und H.S. Reimarus</i> (<i>Gesammelte Schriften</i>,

  Kürschner's <i>Deutsche Nationalliteratur</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BROCKHAUS, FRIEDRICH ARNOLD</b> (1772-1823), German publisher, was
  born at Dortmund, on the 4th of May 1772. He was educated at the
  gymnasium of his native place, and from 1788 to 1793 served an
  apprenticeship in a mercantile house at Düsseldorf. He then devoted two
  years at Leipzig to the study of modern languages and literature, after
  which he set up at Dortmund an emporium for English goods. In 1801 he
  transferred this business to Arnheim, and in the following year to
  Amsterdam. In 1805, having given up his first line of trade, he began
  business as a publisher. Two journals projected by him were not allowed
  by the government to survive for any length of time, and in 1810 the
  complications in the affairs of Holland induced him to return homewards.
  In 1811 he settled at Altenburg. About three years previously he had
  purchased the copyright of the <i>Konversations-Lexikon</i>, started in
  1796, and in 1810-1811 he completed the first edition of this celebrated
  work (14th ed. 1901-4). A second edition under his own editorship was
  begun in 1812, and was received with universal favour. His business
  extended rapidly, and in 1818 Brockhaus removed to Leipzig, where he
  established a large printing-house. Among the more extensive of his many
  literary undertakings were the critical periodicals&mdash;<i>Hermes</i>,
  the <i>Literarisches Konversationsblatt</i> (afterwards the <i>Blätter
  für literarische Unterhaltung</i>), and the <i>Zeitgenossen</i>, and some
  large historical and bibliographical works, such as Raumer's
  <i>Geschichte der Hohenstaufen</i>, and Ebert's <i>Allgemeines
  bibliographisches Lexikon</i>. F.A. Brockhaus died at Leipzig on the 20th
  of August 1823. The business was carried on by his sons, Friedrich
  Brockhaus (1800-1865) who retired in 1850, and Heinrich Brockhaus
  (1804-1874), under whom it was considerably extended. The latter
  especially rendered great services to literature and science, which the
  university of Jena recognized by making him, in 1858, honorary doctor of
  philosophy. In the years 1842-1848, Heinrich Brockhaus was member of the
  Saxon second chamber, as representative for Leipzig, was made honorary
  citizen of that city in 1872, and died there on the 15th of November
  1874.</p>

  <p>Another of Friedrich's sons, <span class="sc">Hermann Brockhaus</span>
  (1806-1877), German Orientalist, was born at Amsterdam on the 28th of
  January 1806. While his two brothers carried on the business he devoted
  himself to an academic career. He was appointed extraordinary professor
  in Jena in 1838, and in 1841 received a call in a similar capacity to
  Leipzig, where in 1848 he was made ordinary professor of ancient Semitic.
  He died at Leipzig on the 5th of January 1877. Brockhaus was an Oriental
  scholar in the old sense of the word, devoting his attention, not to one
  language only, but to acquiring a familiarity with the principal
  languages and literature of the East. He studied Hebrew, Arabic and
  Persian, and was able to lecture on Sanskrit, afterwards his specialty,
  Pali, Zend and even on Chinese. His most important work was the <i>editio
  princeps</i> of the <i>Katha-sarit-sagara</i>, "The Ocean of the Streams
  of Story," the large collection of Sanskrit stories made by Soma Deva in
  the 12th century. By this publication he gave the first impetus to a
  really scientific study of the origin and spreading of popular tales, and
  enabled Prof. Benfey and others to trace the great bulk of Eastern and
  Western stories to an Indian, and more especially to a Buddhistic source.
  Among Prof. Brockhaus's other publications were his edition of the
  curious philosophical play <i>Prabodhachandrodaya</i>, "The Rise of the
  Moon of Intelligence," his critical edition of the "Songs of Hafiz," and
  his publication in Latin letters of the text of the "Zend-Avesta."</p>

  <p><b>BROCKLESBY, RICHARD</b> (1722-1797), English physician, was born at
  Minehead, Somersetshire, on the 11th of August 1722. He was educated at
  Ballitore, in Ireland, where Edmund Burke was one of his schoolfellows,
  studied medicine at Edinburgh, and finally graduated at Leiden in 1745.
  Appointed physician to the army in 1758, he served in Germany during part
  of the Seven Years' War, and on his return settled down to practise in
  London. In 1764 he published <i>Economical and Medical Observations</i>,
  which contained suggestions for improving the hygiene of army hospitals.
  In his latter years he withdrew altogether into private life. The circle
  of his friends included some of the most distinguished literary men of
  the age. He was warmly attached to Dr Johnson, to whom about 1784 he
  offered an annuity of £100 for life, and whom he attended on his
  death-bed, while in 1788 he presented Burke, of whom he was an intimate
  friend, with £1000, and offered to repeat the gift "every year until your
  merit is rewarded as it ought to be at court." He died on the 11th of
  December 1797, leaving his house and part of his fortune to his
  grand-nephew, Dr Thomas Young.</p>

  <p><b>BROCKTON</b>, a city of Plymouth county, Massachusetts, U.S.A.,
  about 20 m. S. of Boston, and containing an area of 21 sq. m. of rolling
  surface. Pop. (1870) 8007; (1880)13,608; (1890) 27,294; (1900) 40,063, of
  whom 9484 were foreign-born, including 2667 Irish, 2199 English Canadians
  and 1973 Swedes; (1910, census) 56,878. It is served by the New York, New
  Haven &amp; Hartford railway. Brockton has a public library, with 54,000
  volumes, in 1908. By popular vote, beginning in 1886 (except in 1898),
  the liquor traffic was prohibited annually. The death-rate, 13.18 in
  1907, is very low for a manufacturing city of its size. Brockton is the
  industrial centre of a large population surrounding it (East and West
  Bridgewater, North Easton, Avon, Randolph, Holbrook and Whitman), and is
  an important manufacturing place. Both in 1900 and in 1905 it ranked
  first among the cities of the United States in the manufacture of boots
  and shoes. The city's total factory product in 1900 was valued at
  $24,855,362, and in 1905 at $37,790,982, an increase during the five
  years of 52%. The boot and shoe product in 1905 was valued at $30,073,014
  (9.4% of the value of the total boot and shoe product of the United
  States), the boot <!-- Page 625 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page625"></a>[v.04 p.0625]</span>and shoe cut stock at $1,344,977,
  and the boot and shoe findings at $2,435,137&mdash;the three combined
  representing 89.6% of the city's total manufactured product. In 1908
  there were 35 shoe factories, including the W.L. Douglas, the Ralston,
  the Walkover, the Eaton, the Keith and the Packard establishments, and,
  in 1905, 14,000,000 (in 1907 about 17,000,000) pairs of shoes were
  produced in the city. Among the other products are lasts, blacking, paper
  and wooden packing boxes, nails and spikes, and shoe fittings and tools.
  The assessed valuation of the city rose from $6,876,427 in 1881 to
  $37,408,332 in 1907. Brockton was a part of Bridgewater until 1821, when
  it was incorporated as the township of North Bridgewater. Its present
  name was adopted in 1874, and it was chartered as a city in 1881.
  Brockton was the first city in Massachusetts to abolish all grade
  crossings (1896) within its limits.</p>

  <p><b>BROCKVILLE,</b> a town and port of entry of Ontario, Canada, and
  capital of Leeds county, named after General Sir Isaac Brock, <span
  class="correction" title="'situtated' in original">situated</span> 119 m.
  S.W. of Montreal, on the left bank of the St Lawrence, and on the Grand
  Trunk, and Brockville &amp; Westport railways. A branch line connects it
  with the Canadian Pacific. It has steamer communication with the St
  Lawrence and Lake Ontario ports, and is a summer resort. The principal
  manufactures are hardware, furnaces, agricultural implements, carriages
  and chemicals. It is the centre of one of the chief dairy districts of
  Canada, and ships large quantities of cheese and butter. Pop. (1881)
  7609; (1901) 8940.</p>

  <p><b>BROD,</b> a town of Croatia-Slavonia, in the county of Pozega, on
  the left bank of the river Save, 124 m. by rail S.E. by E. of Agram. Pop.
  (1900) 7310. The principal Bosnian railway here crosses the river, to
  meet the Hungarian system. Brod has thus a considerable transit trade,
  especially in cereals, wine, spirits, prunes and wood. It is sometimes
  called Slavonisch-Brod, to distinguish it from Bosna-Brod, or
  Bosnisch-Brod, across the river. The town owes its name to a ford
  (Servian <i>brod</i>) of the Save, and dates at least from the 15th
  century. Brod was frequently captured and recaptured in the wars between
  Turkey and Austria; and it was here that the Austrian army mustered, in
  1879, for the occupation of Bosnia.</p>

  <p><b>BRODERIP, WILLIAM JOHN</b> (1789-1859), English naturalist, was
  born in Bristol on the 21st of November 1789. After graduating at Oxford
  he was called to the bar in 1817, and for some years was engaged in
  law-reporting. In 1822 he was appointed a metropolitan police magistrate,
  and filled that office until 1856, first at the Thames police court and
  then at Westminster. His leisure was devoted to natural history, and his
  writings did much to further the study of zoology in England. The
  zoological articles in the <i>Penny Cyclopaedia</i> were written by him,
  and a series of articles contributed to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> were
  reprinted in 1848 as <i>Zoological Recreations</i>, and were followed in
  1852 by <i>Leaves from the Note-book of a Naturalist</i>. He was one of
  the founders of the Zoological Society of London, and a large collection
  of shells which he formed was ultimately bought by the British Museum. He
  died in London on the 27th of February 1859.</p>

  <p><b>BRODHEAD, JOHN ROMEYN</b> (1814-1873), American historical scholar,
  was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of January 1814, the
  son of Jacob Brodhead (1782-1855), a prominent clergyman of the Dutch
  Reformed Church. He graduated at Rutgers College in 1831, and in 1835 was
  admitted to the bar in New York City. After 1837, however, he devoted
  himself principally to the study of American colonial history, and in
  order to have access to the records of the early Dutch settlements in
  America he obtained in 1839 an appointment as attaché of the American
  legation at the Hague. His investigations here soon proved that the Dutch
  archives were rich in material on the early history of New York, and led
  the state legislature to appropriate funds for the systematic gathering
  from various European archives of transcripts of documents relating to
  New York. Brodhead was appointed (1841) by Governor William H. Seward to
  undertake the work, and within several years gathered from England,
  France and Holland some eighty manuscript volumes of transcriptions,
  largely of documents which had not hitherto been used by historians.
  These transcriptions were subsequently edited by Edward O'Callaghan
  (vols. i.-xi. incl.) and by Berthold Fernow (vols. xii.-xv., incl.), and
  published by the state under the title <i>Documents relating to the
  Colonial History of New York</i> (15 vols., 1853-1883). From 1846 to
  1849, while George Bancroft was minister to Great Britain, Brodhead held
  under him the post of secretary of legation. In 1853-1857 he was naval
  officer of the port of New York. He published several addresses and a
  scholarly <i>History of the State of New York</i> (2 vols., 1853-1871),
  generally considered the best for the brief period covered (1609-1690).
  He died in New York City on the 6th of May 1873.</p>

  <p><b>BRODIE, SIR BENJAMIN COLLINS</b>, 1st Bart. (1783-1862), English
  physiologist and surgeon, was born in 1783 at Winterslow, Wiltshire. He
  received his early education from his father; then choosing medicine as
  his profession he went to London in 1801, and attended the lectures of
  John Abernethy. Two years later he became a pupil of Sir Everard Home at
  St George's hospital, and in 1808 was appointed assistant surgeon at that
  institution, on the staff of which he served for over thirty years. In
  1810 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, to which in the next
  four or five years he contributed several papers describing original
  investigations in physiology. At this period also he rapidly obtained a
  large and lucrative practice, and from time to time he wrote on surgical
  questions, contributing numerous papers to the Medical and Chirurgical
  Society, and to the medical journals. Probably his most important work is
  that entitled <i>Pathological and Surgical Observations on the Diseases
  of the Joints</i>, in which he attempts to trace the beginnings of
  disease in the different tissues that form a joint, and to give an exact
  value to the symptom of pain as evidence of organic disease. This volume
  led to the adoption by surgeons of measures of a conservative nature in
  the treatment of diseases of the joints, with consequent reduction in the
  number of amputations and the saving of many limbs and lives. He also
  wrote on diseases of the urinary organs, and on local nervous affections
  of a surgical character. In 1854 he published anonymously a volume of
  <i>Psychological Inquiries</i>; to a second volume which appeared in 1862
  his name was attached. He received many honours during his career. He
  attended George IV., was sergeant-surgeon to William IV. and Queen
  Victoria, and was made a baronet in 1834. He became a corresponding
  member of the French Institute in 1844, D.C.L. of Oxford in 1855, and
  president of the Royal Society in 1858, and he was the first president of
  the general medical council. He died at Broome Park, Surrey, on the 21st
  of October 1862. His collected works, with autobiography, were published
  in 1865 under the editorship of Charles Hawkins.</p>

  <p>His eldest son, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 2nd Bart. (1817-1880),
  was appointed professor of chemistry at Oxford in 1865, and is chiefly
  known for his investigations on the allotropic states of carbon and for
  his discovery of graphitic acid.</p>

  <p><b>BRODIE, PETER BELLINGER</b> (1815-1897), English geologist, son of
  P.B. Brodie, barrister, and nephew of Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, was born in
  London in 1815. While still residing with his father at Lincoln's Inn
  Fields, he gained some knowledge of natural history and an interest in
  fossils from visits to the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, at a
  time when W. Clift was curator. Through the influence of Clift he was
  elected a fellow of the Geological Society early in 1834. Proceeding
  afterwards to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he came under the spell of
  Sedgwick, and henceforth devoted all his leisure time to geology.
  Entering the church in 1838, he was curate at Wylye in Wiltshire, and for
  a short time at Steeple Claydon in Buckinghamshire, becoming later rector
  of Down Hatherley in Gloucestershire, and finally (1855) vicar of
  Rowington in Warwickshire, and rural dean. Records of geological
  observations in all these districts were published by him. At Cambridge
  he obtained fossil shells from the Pleistocene deposit at Barn well; in
  the Vale of Wardour he discovered in Purbeck Beds the isopod named by
  Milne-Edwards <i>Archaeoniscus Brodiei</i>; in Buckinghamshire he
  described the outliers of Purbeck and <!-- Page 626 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page626"></a>[v.04 p.0626]</span>Portland Beds;
  and in the Vale of Gloucester the Lias and Oolites claimed his attention.
  Fossil insects, however, formed the subject of his special studies
  (<i>History of the Fossil Insects of the Secondary Rocks of England</i>,
  1845), and many of his published papers relate to them. He was an active
  member of the Cotteswold Naturalists' Club and of the Warwickshire
  Natural History and Archaeological Society, and in 1854 he was chief
  founder of the Warwickshire Naturalists' and Archaeologists' Field Club.
  In 1887 the Murchison medal was awarded to him by the Geological Society
  of London. He died at Rowington, on the 1st of November 1897.</p>

  <p><b>BRODY,</b> a town of Austria, in Galicia, 62 m. E. of Lemberg by
  rail. Pop. (1900) 17,360, of which about two-thirds are Jews. It is
  situated near the Russian frontier, and has been one of the most
  important commercial centres in Galicia, especially for the trade with
  Russia. But since 1879, when its charter as a free commercial city was
  withdrawn, its trade has also greatly diminished. Brody was created a
  town in 1684, and was raised to the rank of a free commercial city in
  1779.</p>

  <p><b>BROEKHUIZEN, JAN VAN</b> [<span class="sc">Janus
  Broukhusius</span>], (1649-1707), Dutch classical scholar and poet, was
  born on the 20th of November 1649, at Amsterdam. Having lost his father
  when very young, he was placed with an apothecary, with whom he lived
  several years. Not liking this employment, he entered the army, and in
  1674 was sent with his regiment to America, in the fleet under Admiral de
  Ruyter, but returned to Holland the same year. In 1678 he was sent to the
  garrison at Utrecht, where he contracted a friendship with the celebrated
  Graevius; here he had the misfortune to be so deeply implicated in a duel
  that, according to the laws of Holland, his life was forfeited. Graevius,
  however, wrote immediately to Nicholas Heinsius, who obtained his pardon.
  Not long afterwards he became a captain of one of the companies then at
  Amsterdam. After the peace of Ryswick, 1697, his company was disbanded,
  and he retired on a pension to a country house near Amsterdam and pursued
  his classical and literary studies at leisure. His Dutch poems, in which
  he followed the model of Pieter Hooft, were first published in 1677; a
  later edition, with a biography by D. van Hoogstraten, appeared in 1712,
  the last edition, 1883, was edited by R.A. Kollewijn. His classical
  reputation rests on his editions of Propertius (1702) and Tibullus
  (1707). His Latin poems (<i>Carmina</i>) appeared in 1684; a later
  edition(<i>Poemata</i>) by D. van Hoogstraten appeared in 1711. The
  <i>Select Letters</i> (<i>Jani Browkhusii Epistolae Selectae</i>, 1889
  and 1893) were edited by J.A. Worp, who also wrote his biography, 1891.
  Broekhuizen died on the 15th of December 1707.</p>

  <p><b>BRÖGGER, WALDEMAR CHRISTOFER</b> (1851- ), Norwegian geologist, was
  born in Christiania on the 10th of November 1851, and educated in that
  city. In 1876 he was appointed curator of the geological museum in his
  native city, and assistant on the Geological Survey. He was professor of
  mineralogy and geology from 1881 to 1890 in the university of Stockholm,
  and from 1890 in the university of Christiania. He also became rector and
  president of the senate of the royal university of Christiania. His
  observations on the igneous rocks of south Tirol compared with those of
  Christiania afford much information on the relations of the granitic and
  basic rocks. The subject of the differentiation of rock-types in the
  process of solidification as plutonic or volcanic rocks from a particular
  magma received much attention from him. He dealt also with the Palaeozoic
  rocks of Norway, and with the late glacial and post-glacial changes of
  level in the Christiania region. The honorary degree of Ph.D. was
  conferred upon him by the university of Heidelberg and that of LL.D. by
  the university of Glasgow. The Murchison medal of the Geological Society
  of London was awarded to him in 1891.</p>

  <p><b>BROGLIE, DE,</b> the name of a noble French family which,
  originally Piedmontese, emigrated to France in the year 1643. The head of
  the family, <span class="sc">François Marie</span> (1611-1656), then took
  the title of comte de Broglie. He had already distinguished himself as a
  soldier, and died, as a lieutenant-general, at the siege of Valenza on
  the 2nd of July 1656. His son, <span class="sc">Victor Maurice, Comte de
  Broglie</span> (1647-1727), served under Condé, Turenne and other great
  commanders of the age of Louis XIV., becoming <i>maréchal de camp</i> in
  1676, lieutenant-general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in
  1724.</p>

  <p>The eldest son of Victor Marie, <span class="sc">François
  Marie</span>, afterwards <span class="sc">Duc de Broglie</span>
  (1671-1745), entered the army at an early age, and had a varied career of
  active service before he was made, at the age of twenty-three,
  lieutenant-colonel of the king's regiment of cavalry. He served
  continuously in the War of the Spanish Succession and was present at
  Malplaquet. He was made lieutenant-general in 1710, and served with
  Villars in the last campaign of the war and at the battle of Denain.
  During the peace he continued in military employment, and in 1719 he was
  made director-general of cavalry and dragoons. He was also employed in
  diplomatic missions, and was ambassador in England in 1724. The war in
  Italy called him into the field again in 1733, and in the following year
  he was made marshal of France. In the campaign of 1734 he was one of the
  chief commanders on the French side, and he fought the battles of Parma
  and Guastalla. A famous episode was his narrow personal escape when his
  quarters on the Secchia were raided by the enemy on the night of the 14th
  of September 1734. In 1735 he directed a war of positions with credit,
  but he was soon replaced by Marshal de Noailles. He was governor-general
  of Alsace when Frederick the Great paid a secret visit to Strassburg
  (1740). In 1742 de Broglie was appointed to command the French army in
  Germany, but such powers as he had possessed were failing him, and he had
  always been the "man of small means," safe and cautious, but lacking in
  elasticity and daring. The only success obtained was in the action of
  Sahay (25th May 1742), for which he was made a duke. He returned to
  France in 1743, and died two years later.</p>

  <p>His son, <span class="sc">Victor François, Duc de Broglie</span>
  (1718-1804), served with his father at Parma and Guastalla, and in 1734
  obtained a colonelcy. In the German War he took part in the storming of
  Prague in 1742, and was made a brigadier. In 1744 and 1745 he saw further
  service on the Rhine, and in 1756 he was made <i>maréchal de camp</i>. He
  subsequently served with Marshal Saxe in the low countries, and was
  present at Roucoux, Val and Maastricht. At the end of the war he was made
  a lieutenant-general. During the Seven Years' War he served successively
  under d'Estrées, Soubise and Contades, being present at all the battles
  from Hastenbeck onwards. His victory over Prince Ferdinand at Bergen
  (1759) won him the rank of marshal of France from his own sovereign and
  that of prince of the empire from the emperor Francis I. In 1760 he won
  an action at Corbach, but was defeated at Vellinghausen in 1761. After
  the war he fell into disgrace and was not recalled to active employment
  until 1778, when he was given command of the troops designed to operate
  against England. He played a prominent part in the Revolution, which he
  opposed with determination. After his emigration, de Broglie commanded
  the "army of the princes" for a short time (1792). He died at Münster in
  1804.</p>

  <p>Another son of the first duke, <span class="sc">Charles François,
  Comte de Broglie</span> (1719-1781), served for some years in the army,
  and afterwards became one of the foremost diplomatists in the service of
  Louis XV. He is chiefly remembered in connexion with the <i>Secret du
  Roi</i>, the private, as distinct from the official, diplomatic service
  of Louis, of which he was the ablest and most important member. The son
  of Victor François, <span class="sc">Victor Claude, Prince de
  Broglie</span> (1757-1794), served in the army, attaining the rank of
  <i>maréchal de camp</i>. He adopted revolutionary opinions, served with
  Lafayette and Rochambeau in America, was a member of the Jacobin Club,
  and sat in the Constituent Assembly, constantly voting on the Liberal
  side. He served as chief of the staff to the Republican army on the
  Rhine; but in the Terror he was denounced, arrested and executed at Paris
  on the 27th of June 1794. His dying admonition to his little son was to
  remain <!-- Page 627 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page627"></a>[v.04
  p.0627]</span>faithful to the principles of the Revolution, however
  unjust and ungrateful.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Achille Charles Léonce Victor, Duc de Broglie</span>
  (1785-1870), statesman and diplomatist, son of the last-named, was born
  at Paris on the 28th of November 1785. His mother had shared her
  husband's imprisonment, but managed to escape to Switzerland, where she
  remained till the fall of Robespierre. She now returned to Paris with her
  children and lived there quietly until 1796, when she married a M.
  d'Argenson, grandson of Louis XV.'s minister of war. Under the care of
  his step-father young de Broglie received a careful and liberal education
  and made his entrée into the aristocratic and literary society of Paris
  under the Empire. In 1809, he was appointed a member of the council of
  state, over which Napoleon presided in person; and was sent by the
  emperor on diplomatic missions, as attaché, to various countries. Though
  he had never been in sympathy with the principles of the Empire, de
  Broglie was not one of those who rejoiced at its downfall. In common with
  all men of experience and sense he realized the danger to France of the
  rise to power of the forces of violent reaction. With Decazes and
  Richelieu he saw that the only hope for a calm future lay in "the
  reconciliation of the Restoration with the Revolution." By the influence
  of his uncle, Prince Amédée de Broglie, his right to a peerage had been
  recognized; and to his own great surprise he received, in June 1814, a
  summons from Louis XVIII. to the Chamber of Peers. There, after the
  Hundred Days, he distinguished himself by his courageous defence of
  Marshal Ney, for whose acquittal he, alone of all the peers, both spoke
  and voted. After this defiant act of opposition it was perhaps fortunate
  that his impending marriage gave him an excuse for leaving the country.
  On the 15th of February 1816, he was married at Leghorn to the daughter
  of Madame de Staël. He returned to Paris at the end of the year, but took
  no part in politics until the elections of September 1817 broke the power
  of the "ultra-royalists" and substituted for the <i>Chambre
  introuvable</i> a moderate assembly. De Broglie's political attitude
  during the years that followed is best summed up in his own words: "From
  1812 to 1822 all the efforts of men of sense and character were directed
  to reconciling the Restoration and the Revolution, the old régime and the
  new France. From 1822 to 1827 all their efforts were directed to
  resisting the growing power of the counter-revolution. From 1827 to 1830
  all their efforts aimed at moderating and regulating the reaction in a
  contrary sense." During the last critical years of Charles X.'s reign, de
  Broglie identified himself with the <i>doctrinaires</i>, among whom
  Royer-Collard and Guizot were the most prominent. The July revolution
  placed him in a difficult position; he knew nothing of the intrigues
  which placed Louis Philippe on the throne; but, the revolution once
  accomplished, he was ready to uphold the <i>fait accompli</i> with
  characteristic loyalty, and on the 9th of August took office in the new
  government as minister of public worship and education. As he had
  foreseen, the ministry was short-lived, and on the 2nd of November he was
  once more out of office. During the critical time that followed he
  consistently supported the principles which triumphed with the fall of
  Laffitte and the accession to power of Casimir Périer in March 1832.
  After the death of the latter and the insurrection of June 1832, de
  Broglie took office once more as minister for foreign affairs (October
  11th). His tenure of the foreign office was coincident with a very
  critical period in international relations. But for the sympathy of Great
  Britain under Palmerston, the July monarchy would have been completely
  isolated in Europe; and this sympathy the aggressive policy of France in
  Belgium and on the Mediterranean coast of Africa had been in danger of
  alienating. The Belgian crisis had been settled, so far as the two powers
  were concerned, before de Broglie took office; but the concerted military
  and naval action for the coercion of the Dutch, which led to the French
  occupation of Antwerp, was carried out under his auspices. The good
  understanding of which this was the symbol characterized also the
  relations of de Broglie and Palmerston during the crisis of the first war
  of Mehemet Ali (<i>q.v.</i>) with the Porte, and in the affairs of the
  Spanish peninsula their common sympathy with constitutional liberty led
  to an agreement for common action, which took shape in the treaty of
  alliance between Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, signed at
  London on the 22nd of April 1834. De Broglie had retired from office in
  the March preceding, and did not return to power till March of the
  following year, when he became head of the cabinet. In 1836, the
  government having been defeated on a proposal to reduce the five per
  cents, he once more resigned, and never returned to official life. He had
  remained in power long enough to prove what honesty of purpose,
  experience of affairs, and common sense can accomplish when allied with
  authority. The debt that France and Europe owed him may be measured by
  comparing the results of his policy with that of his successors under not
  dissimilar circumstances. He had found France isolated and Europe full of
  the rumours of war; he left her strong in the English alliance and the
  respect of Liberal Europe, and Europe freed from the restless
  apprehensions which were to be stirred into life again by the attitude of
  Thiers in the Eastern Question and of Guizot in the affair of the
  "Spanish marriages." From 1836 to 1848 de Broglie held almost completely
  aloof from politics, to which his scholarly temperament little inclined
  him, a disinclination strengthened by the death of his wife on the 22nd
  of September 1838. His friendship for Guizot, however, induced him to
  accept a temporary mission in 1845, and in 1847 to go as French
  ambassador to London. The revolution of 1848 was a great blow to him, for
  he realized that it meant the final ruin of the Liberal monarchy&mdash;in
  his view the political system best suited to France. He took his seat,
  however, in the republican National Assembly and in the Convention of
  1848, and, as a member of the section known as the "Burgraves," did his
  best to stem the tide of socialism and to avert the reaction in favour of
  autocracy which he foresaw. He shared with his colleagues the indignity
  of the <i>coup d'état</i> of the 2nd of December 1851, and remained for
  the remainder of his life one of the bitterest enemies of the imperial
  regime, though he was heard to remark, with that caustic wit for which he
  was famous, that the empire was "the government which the poorer classes
  in France desired and the rich deserved." The last twenty years of his
  life were devoted chiefly to philosophical and literary pursuits. Having
  been brought up by his step-father in the sceptical opinions of the time,
  he gradually arrived at a sincere belief in the Christian religion. "I
  shall die," said he, "a penitent Christian and an impenitent Liberal."
  His literary works, though few of them have been published, were rewarded
  in 1856 by a seat in the French Academy, and he was also a member of
  another branch of the French Institute, the Academy of Moral and
  Political Science. In the labours of those learned bodies he took an
  active and assiduous part. He died on the 25th of January 1870.</p>

  <p>Besides his <i>Souvenirs</i>, in 4 vols. (Paris, 1885-1888), the duc
  de Broglie left numerous works, of which only some have been published.
  Of these may be mentioned <i>Écrits et discours</i> (3 vols., Paris,
  1863); <i>Le Libre Échange et l'impôt</i> (Paris, 1879); <i>Vues sur le
  gouvernement de la France</i> (Paris, 1861). This last was confiscated
  before publication by the imperial government. See Guizot, <i>Le Duc de
  Broglie</i> (Paris, 1870), and <i>Mémoires</i> (Paris, 1858-1867); and
  the histories of Thureau-Dangin and Duvergier de Hauranne.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Jacques Victor Albert, Duc de Broglie</span>
  (1821-1901), his eldest son, was born at Paris on the 13th of June 1821.
  After a brief diplomatic career at Madrid and Rome, the revolution of
  1848 caused him to withdraw from public life and devote himself to
  literature. He had already published a translation of the religious
  system of Leibnitz (1846). He now at once made his mark by his
  contributions to the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i> and the Orleanist and
  clerical organ <i>Le Correspondant</i>, which were afterwards collected
  under the titles of <i>Études morales et littéraires</i> (1853) and
  <i>Questions de religion et d'histoire</i> (1860). These were
  supplemented in 1869 by a volume of <i>Nouvelles études de littérature et
  de morale</i>. His <i>L'Église et l'empire romain au IVe siècle</i>
  (1856-1866) brought him the succession to Lacordaire's seat in the
  Academy in 1862. In 1870 he succeeded his father in the dukedom, having
  previously been known as the prince de Broglie. In the following year he
  was elected to the National <!-- Page 628 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page628"></a>[v.04 p.0628]</span>Assembly for the department of the
  Eure, and a few days later (on the 19th of February) was appointed
  ambassador in London; but in March 1872, in consequence of criticisms
  upon his negotiations concerning the commercial treaties between England
  and France, he resigned his post and took his seat in the National
  Assembly, where he became the leading spirit of the monarchical campaign
  against Thiers. On the replacement of the latter by Marshal MacMahon, the
  duc de Broglie became president of the council and minister for foreign
  affairs (May 1873), but in the reconstruction of the ministry on the 26th
  of November, after the passing of the septennate, transferred himself to
  the ministry of the interior. His tenure of office was marked by an
  extreme conservatism, which roused the bitter hatred of the Republicans,
  while he alienated the Legitimist party by his friendly relations with
  the Bonapartists, and the Bonapartists by an attempt to effect a
  compromise between the rival claimants to the monarchy. The result was
  the fall of the cabinet on the 16th of May 1874. Three years later (on
  the 16th of May 1877) he was entrusted with the formation of a new
  cabinet, with the object of appealing to the country and securing a new
  chamber more favourable to the reactionaries than its predecessor had
  been. The result, however, was a decisive Republican majority. The duc de
  Broglie was defeated in his own district, and resigned office on the 20th
  of November. Not being re-elected in 1885, he abandoned politics and
  reverted to his historical work, publishing a series of historical
  studies and biographies written in a most pleasing style, and especially
  valuable for their extensive documentation. He died in Paris on the 19th
  of January 1901.</p>

  <p>Besides editing the <i>Souvenirs</i> of his father (1886, &amp;c.),
  the <i>Mémoires</i> of Talleyrand (1891, &amp;c.), and the <i>Letters</i>
  of the Duchess Albertine de Broglie (1896), he published <i>Le Secret du

  <p><b>BROHAN, AUGUSTINE SUSANNE</b> (1807-1887), French actress, was born
  in Paris on the 22nd of January 1807. She entered the Conservatoire at
  the age of eleven, and took the second prize for comedy in 1820, and the
  first in 1821. She served her apprenticeship in the provinces, making her
  first Paris appearance at the Odéon in 1832 as Dorine in <i>Tartuffe</i>.
  Her success there and elsewhere brought her a summons to the Comédie
  Française, where she made her <i>début</i> on the 15th of February 1834,
  as Madelon in <i>Les Précieuses ridicules</i>, and Suzanne in <i>Le
  Mariage de Figaro</i>. She retired in 1842, and died on the 16th of
  August 1887.</p>

  <p>Her elder daughter, <span class="sc">Josephine Félicité Augustine
  Brohan</span> (1824-1893), was admitted to the Conservatoire when very
  young, twice taking the second prize for comedy. The soubrette part,
  entrusted for more than 150 years at the Comédie Française to a
  succession of artists of the first rank, was at the moment without a
  representative, and Mdlle Augustine Brohan made her <i>début</i> there on
  the 19th of May 1841, as Dorine in <i>Tartuffe</i>, and Lise in <i>Rivaux
  d'eux-mêmes</i>. She was immediately admitted <i>pensionnaire</i>, and at
  the end of eighteen months unanimously elected <i>sociétaire</i>. She
  soon became a great favourite, not only in the plays of Molière and de
  Regnard, but also in those of Marivaux. On her retirement from the stage
  in 1866, she made an unhappy marriage with Edmond David de Gheest (d.
  1885), secretary to the Belgian legation in Paris.</p>

  <p>Susanne Brohan's second daughter, <span class="sc">Émilie Madeleine
  Brohan</span> (1833-1900), also took first prize for comedy at the
  Conservatoire (1850). She was engaged at once by the Comédie Française,
  but instead of making her <i>début</i> in some play of the
  <i>répertoire</i> of the theatre, the management put on for her benefit a
  new comedy by Scribe and Legouvé, <i>Les Contes de la reine de
  Navarre</i>, in which she created the part of Marguerite on the 1st of
  September 1850. Her talents and beauty made her a success from the first,
  and in less than two years from her <i>début</i> she was elected
  <i>sociétaire</i>. In 1853 she married Mario Uchard, from whom she was
  soon separated, and in 1858 she returned to the Comédie Française in
  leading parts, until her retirement in 1886. Her name is associated with
  a great number of plays, besides those in the classical
  <i>répertoire</i>, notably <i>Le Monde où l'on s'ennuie</i>, <i>Par droit
  de conquête</i>, <i>Les Deux Veuves</i>, and <i>Le Lion amoureux</i>, in
  which, as the "marquise de Maupas", she had one of her greatest
  successes.</p>

  <p><b>BROKE,</b> or <span class="sc">Brooke</span>, <b>ARTHUR</b> (d.
  1563), English author, wrote the first English version of the story of
  Romeo and Juliet. <i>The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Julieit</i>
  (1562) is a rhymed account of the story, taken, not directly from
  Bandello's collection of novels (1554), but from the French translation
  (<i>Histoires tragiques</i>) of Pierre Boaistuau or Boisteau, surnamed
  Launay, and François de Belleforest. Broke adds some detail to the story
  as told by Boisteau. As the poem contains many scenes which are not known
  to exist elsewhere, but which were adopted by Shakespeare in <i>Romeo and
  Juliet</i>, there is no reasonable doubt that it may be regarded as the
  main source of the play. Broke perished by shipwreck in 1563, on his way
  from Newhaven to join the English troops fighting on the Huguenot side in
  France.</p>

  <p>The genesis of the Juliet story, and a close comparison of
  Shakespeare's play with Broke's version, are to be found in a reprint of
  the poem and of William Paynter's prose translation from the <i>Palace of
  Pleasure</i>, edited by Mr P. A. Daniel for the New Shakespere Society
  (1875).</p>

  <p><b>BROKE, SIR PHILIP BOWES VERE,</b> <span class="scac">BART.</span>
  (1776-1841), British rear-admiral, was born at Broke Hall, near Ipswich,
  on the 9th of September 1776, a member of an old Suffolk family. Entering
  the navy in June 1792, he saw active service in the Mediterranean from
  1793 to 1795, and was with the British fleet at the battle of Cape St
  Vincent, 1797. In 1798 he was present at the defeat and capture of the
  French squadron off the north coast of Ireland. From 1799 to 1801 he
  served with the North Sea fleet, and in the latter year was made captain.
  Unemployed for the next four years, he commanded in 1805 a frigate in the
  English and Irish Channels. In 1806 he was appointed to the command of
  the "Shannon", 38-gun frigate, remaining afloat, principally in the Bay
  of Biscay, till 1811. The "Shannon" was then ordered to Halifax, Nova
  Scotia. For a year after the declaration of war between Great Britain and
  the United States in 1812, the frigate saw no important service, though
  she captured several prizes. Broke utilized this period of comparative
  inactivity to train his men thoroughly. He paid particular attention to
  gunnery, and the "Shannon" ere long gained a unique reputation for
  excellence of shooting. Broke's opportunity came in 1813. In May of that
  year the "Shannon" was cruising off Boston, watching the "Chesapeake", an
  American frigate of the same nominal force but heavier armament. On the
  1st of June Broke, finding his water supply getting low, wrote to
  Lawrence, the commander of the "Chesapeake", asking for a meeting between
  the two ships, stating the "Shannon's" force, and guaranteeing that no
  other British ship should take part in the engagement. Before this letter
  could be delivered, however, the "Chesapeake", under full sail, ran out
  of Boston harbour, crowds of pleasure-boats accompanying her to witness
  the engagement. Broke briefly addressed his men. "Don't cheer," he
  concluded, "go quietly to your quarters. I feel sure you will all do your
  duty." As the "Chesapeake" rounded to on the "Shannon's" weather quarter,
  at a distance of about fifty yards, the British frigate received her with
  a broadside. A hundred of the "Chesapeake's" crew were struck down at
  once, Lawrence himself being mortally wounded. A second broadside,
  equally well-aimed, increased the confusion, and, her tiller-ropes being
  shot away, the American frigate drifted foul of the "Shannon". Broke
  sprang on board with some sixty of his men following him. After a brief
  struggle <!-- Page 629 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page629"></a>[v.04 p.0629]</span>the fight was over. Within fifteen
  minutes of the firing of the first shot, the "Chesapeake" struck her
  flag, but Broke himself was seriously wounded. For his services he was
  rewarded with a baronetcy, and subsequently was made a K.C.B. His exploit
  captivated the public fancy, and his popular title of "Brave Broke" gives
  the standard by which his action was judged. Its true significance,
  however, lies deeper. Broke's victory was due not so much to courage as
  to forethought. "The 'Shannon,'" said Admiral Jurien de La Gravière,
  "captured the 'Chesapeake' on the 1st of June 1813; but on the 14th of
  September 1806, when he took command of his frigate, Captain Broke had
  begun to prepare the glorious termination to this bloody affair." Broke's
  wound incapacitated him from further service, and for the rest of his
  life caused him serious suffering. He died in London on the 2nd of
  January 1841.</p>

  <p><b>BROKEN HILL,</b> a silver-mining town of Yancowinna county, New
  South Wales, Australia, 925 m. directly W. by N. of Sydney, and connected
  with Adelaide by rail. Pop. (1901) 27,518. One of the neighbouring mines,
  the Proprietary, is the richest in the world; gold is associated with the
  silver; large quantities of lead, good copper lodes, zinc and tin are
  also found. The problem of the profitable treatment of the sulphide ores
  has been practically solved here. In addition Broken Hill is the centre
  of one of the largest pastoral districts in Australia. The town is the
  seat of the Roman Catholic bishop of Wilcannia.</p>

  <p><b>BROKER</b> (according to the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, from
  Lat. <i>brocca</i>, spit, spike, <i>broccare</i>, to
  "broach"&mdash;another Eng. form of the same word; hence O. Fr. <i>vendre
  à broche</i>, to retail, e.g. wine, from the tap, and thus the general
  sense of dealing; see also for a discussion of the etymology and early
  history of the use of the word, J.R. Dos Passos, <i>Law of
  Stockbrokers</i>, chap. i., New York, 1905). In the primary sense of the
  word, a broker is a mercantile agent, of the class known as general
  agents, whose office is to bring together intending buyers and sellers
  and make a contract between them, for a remuneration called brokerage or
  commission; e.g. cotton brokers, wool brokers or produce brokers.
  Originally the only contracts negotiated by brokers were for the sale or
  purchase of commodities; but the word in its present use includes other
  classes of mercantile agents, such as stockbrokers, insurance-brokers,
  ship-brokers or bill-brokers. Pawnbrokers are not brokers in any proper
  sense of the word; they deal as principals and do not act as agents. In
  discussing the chief questions of modern legal interest in connexion with
  brokers, we shall deal with them, firstly, in the original sense of
  agents for the purchase and sale of goods.</p>

  <p><i>Relations between Broker and Principal.</i>&mdash;A broker has not,
  like a factor, possession of his principal's goods, and, unless expressly
  authorized, cannot buy or sell in his own name; his business is to bring
  into privity of contract his principal and the third party. When the
  contract is made, ordinarily he drops out altogether. Brokers very
  frequently act as factors also, but, when they do so, their rights and
  duties as factors must be distinguished from their rights and duties as
  brokers. It is a broker's duty to carry out his principal's instructions
  with diligence, skill and perfect good faith. He must see that the terms
  of the bargain accord with his principal's orders from a commercial point
  of view, e.g. as to quality, quantity and price; he must ensure that the
  contract of sale effected by him be legally enforceable by his principal
  against the third party; and he must not accept any commission from the
  third party, or put himself in any position in which his own interest may
  become opposed to his principal's. As soon as he has made the contract
  which he was employed to make, in most respects his duty to, and his
  authority from, his principal alike cease; and consequently the law of
  brokers relates principally to the formation of contracts by them.</p>

  <p>The most important formality in English law, in making contracts for
  the sale of goods, with which a broker must comply, in order to make the
  contract legally enforceable by his principal against the third party, is
  contained in section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893, which (in substance
  re-enacting section 17 of the Statute of Frauds) provides as
  follows:&mdash;"A contract for the sale of any goods of the value of ten
  pounds or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the buyer
  shall accept part of the goods as sold, and actually receive the same, or
  give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment, or
  <i>unless some note or memorandum in writing of the contract be made and
  signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf</i>."</p>

  <p>From the reign of James I. till 1884 brokers in London were admitted
  and licensed by the corporation, and regulated by statute; and it was
  common to employ one broker only, who acted as intermediary between, and
  was the agent of both buyer and seller. When the Statute of Frauds was
  passed in the reign of Charles II., it became the practice for the
  broker, acting for both parties, to insert in a formal book, kept for the
  purpose, a memorandum of each contract effected by him, and to sign such
  memorandum on behalf of both parties, in order that there might be a
  written memorandum of the contract of sale, signed by the agent of the
  parties as required by the statute. He would then send to the buyer a
  copy of this memorandum, called the "bought note", and to the seller a
  "sold note", which would run as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I have this day bought for you from A B [or "my principal"] ..."</p>
      <p class="i30">[signed] "M, <i>Broker</i>."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I have this day sold for you to A B [or "my principal"] ..."</p>
      <p class="i30">[signed] "M, <i>Broker</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There was in the earlier part of the 19th century considerable
  discussion in the courts as to whether the entry in a broker's book, or
  the bought and sold notes (singly or together), constituted the statutory
  memorandum; and judicial opinion was not unanimous on the point. But at
  the present day brokers are no longer regulated by statute, either in
  London or elsewhere, and keep no formal book; and as an entry made in a
  private book kept by the broker for another purpose, even if signed,
  would probably not be regarded as a memorandum signed by the agent of the
  parties in that behalf, the old discussion is now of little practical
  interest.</p>

  <p>Under modern conditions of business the written memorandum of the
  contract of sale effected by the broker is usually to be found in a
  "contract note"; but the question whether, in the particular
  circumstances of each case, the contract note affords a sufficient
  memorandum in writing, depends upon a variety of
  considerations&mdash;e.g. whether the transaction is effected through one
  or through two brokers; whether the contract notes are rendered by one
  broker only, or by both; and, if the latter, whether exchanged between
  the brokers, or rendered by each broker to his own client; for under
  present practice any one of these methods may obtain, according to the
  trade in which the transaction is effected, and the nature of the
  particular transaction.</p>

  <p>Where one and the same broker is employed by both seller and buyer,
  bought and sold notes rendered in the old form provide the necessary
  memorandum of the contract. Where two brokers are employed, one by the
  seller and one by the buyer, sometimes one drops out as soon as the terms
  are negotiated, and the other makes out, signs and sends to the parties
  the bought and sold notes. The latter then becomes the agent of both
  parties for the purpose of signing the statutory memorandum, and the
  position is the same as if one broker only had been employed. On the
  other hand, if one broker does not drop out of the transaction, each
  broker remains to the end the agent of his own principal only, and
  neither becomes the agent of the other party for the purpose of signing
  the memorandum. In such a case it is the usual practice for the buyer's
  broker to send to the seller's broker a note of the contract,&mdash;"I,
  acting on account of A. B. [or, "of my principal,"], have this day bought
  <i>from</i> you, acting on account of C. D. [or, "of your
  principal"],"&mdash;and to receive a corresponding note from the seller's
  broker. Thus each of the parties receives through his own agent a
  memorandum signed by the other party's agent. These contract notes are
  usually known as, and serve the purpose of, "bought" and "sold" notes. In
  all the above three cases the broker's duty of compliance with all
  formalities necessary to make the contract of sale legally enforceable is
  performed, <!-- Page 630 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page630"></a>[v.04 p.0630]</span>and both parties obtain a written
  memorandum of the contract upon which they can sue.</p>

  <p>The broker, on performing his duty in accordance with the terms upon
  which he is employed, is entitled to be paid his "brokerage." This
  usually takes the form of a percentage, varying according to the nature
  and conditions of the business, upon the total price of the goods bought
  or sold through him. When he guarantees the solvency of the other party,
  he is said to be employed upon <i>del credere</i> terms, and is entitled
  to a higher rate of remuneration. In some trades it is the custom for the
  selling broker to receive payment from the buyer or his broker; and in
  such case it is his duty to account to his principal for the purchase
  money. A broker who properly expends money or incurs liability on his
  principal's behalf in the course of his employment, is entitled to be
  reimbursed the money, and indemnified against the liability. Not having,
  like a factor, possession of the goods, a broker has no lien by which to
  enforce his rights against his principal. If he fails to perform his
  duty, he loses his right to remuneration, reimbursement and indemnity,
  and further becomes liable to an action for damages for breach of his
  contract of employment, at the suit of his principal.</p>

  <p><i>Relations between Broker and Third Party.</i>&mdash;A broker who
  signs a contract note <i>as broker</i> on behalf of a principal, whether
  named or not, is not personally liable on the contract to the third
  party. But if he makes the contract in such a way as to make himself a
  party to it, the third party may sue either the broker or his principal,
  subject to the limitation that the third party, by his election to treat
  one as the party to the contract, may preclude himself from suing the
  other. In this respect the ordinary rules of the law of agency apply to a
  broker. Generally, a broker has not authority to receive payment, but in
  trades in which it is customary for him to do so, if the buyer pays the
  seller's broker, and is then sued by the seller for the price by reason
  of the broker having become insolvent or absconded, he may set up the
  payment to the broker as a defence to the action by the broker's
  principal. Brokers may render themselves liable for damages in tort for
  the conversion of the goods at the suit of the true owner if they
  negotiate a sale of the goods for a selling principal who has no title to
  the goods.</p>

  <p><i>The Influence of Exchanges.</i>&mdash;The relations between brokers
  and their principals, and also between brokers and third parties as above
  defined, have been to some extent modified in practice by the institution
  since the middle of the 19th century in important commercial centres of
  "Exchanges," where persons interested in a particular trade, whether as
  merchants or as brokers, meet for the transaction of business. By the
  contract of membership of the association in whose hands is vested the
  control of the exchange, every person on becoming a member agrees to be
  bound by the rules of the association, and to make his contracts on the
  market in accordance with them. A governing body or committee elected by
  the members enforces observance of the rules, and members who fail to
  meet their engagements on the market, or to conform to the rules, are
  liable to suspension or expulsion by the committee. All disputes between
  members on their contracts are submitted to an arbitration tribunal
  composed of members; and the arbitrators in deciding the questions
  submitted to them are guided by the rules. A printed book of rules is
  available for reference; and various printed forms of contract suited to
  the various requirements of the business are specified by the rules and
  supplied by the association for the use of members. In order to simplify
  the settlement of accounts between members, particularly in respect of
  "futures," i.e. contracts for future delivery, a weekly or other
  periodical settlement is effected by means of a clearing-house; each
  member paying or receiving in respect of all his contracts which are
  still open, the balance of his weekly "differences," i.e. the difference
  between the contract price and the market price fixed for the settlement,
  or between the last and the present settlement prices.</p>

  <p>As all contracts on the market are made subject to the rules, it
  follows that so far as the rules alter the rights and liabilities
  attached by law, the ordinary law is modified. The most important
  modification in the position of brokers effected by membership of such an
  exchange is due to the rule that as, between themselves, all members are
  principals, on the market no agents are recognized; a broker employed by
  a non-member to buy for him on the market is treated by the rules as
  buying for himself, and is, therefore, personally liable on the contract.
  If it be a contract in futures, he is required to conform to the weekly
  settlement rules. If his principal fails to take delivery, the engagement
  is his and he is required to make good to the member who sold to him any
  difference between the contract and market price at the date of delivery.
  But whilst this practice alters directly the relations of the broker to
  the third party, it also affects or tends to affect indirectly the
  relations of the broker to his own principal. The terms of the contract
  of employment being a matter of negotiation and agreement between them,
  it is open to a broker, if he chooses, to stipulate for particular terms;
  and it is the usual practice of exchanges to supply printed contract
  forms for the use of members in their dealings with non-members who
  employ them as brokers, containing a stipulation that the contract is
  made subject to the rules of the exchange; and frequently also a clause
  that the contract is made with the broker as <i>principal</i>. In
  addition to these express terms, there is in the contract of employment
  the term, implied by law in all trade contracts, that the parties consent
  to be bound by such trade usages as are consistent with the express terms
  of the contract, and reasonable. On executing an order the broker sends
  to his client a contract-note either in the form of the old bought and
  sold notes "I have this day [bought / sold] for you," or, when the
  principal clause is inserted, "I have this day [sold to / bought] from
  you." These are not bought and sold notes proper, for the broker is not
  the agent of the third party for the purpose of signing them as statutory
  memoranda of the sale. But they purport to record the terms of the
  contract of employment, and the principal may treat himself as bound by
  their provisions. Sometimes they are accompanied by a detachable form,
  known as the "client's return contract note," to be filled in, signed and
  returned by the client; but even the "client's return contract note" is
  retained by the client's own broker, and is only a memorandum of the
  terms of employment. The following is a form of contract note rendered by
  a broker to his client for American cotton, bought on the Liverpool
  Cotton Exchange for future delivery. The client's contract note is
  attached to it, and is in precisely corresponding form.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">AMERICAN COTTON</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Delivery Contract Note.</i></p>

  <p>We have this day.............. to/from you .............. lb American
  Cotton, net weight, to be contained in .............. American Bales,
  more or less, to be delivered in Liverpool, during .............. on the
  basis of .......... per lb for ............ on the terms of the rules,

  Association, Limited, whether endorsed hereon or not.</p>

  <p>The contract, of which this is a note, is made between ourselves and
  yourselves, and not by or with any person, whether disclosed or not, on

  into. Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="cenhead">...................</p>

  <p>The contract, of which the above is a note, was made on the date
  specified, within the business hours fixed by the Liverpool Cotton
  Association, Limited.</p>

  <p>Please confirm by signing and returning the contract attached.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above form of contract note illustrates the tendency of exchanges
  to alter the relations between the broker and his principal. The object
  of inserting in the printed form the provision that the contract is made
  subject to the rules of the <!-- Page 631 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page631"></a>[v.04 p.0631]</span>Liverpool Cotton Association is to
  make those rules binding upon the principal, and if he employs his broker
  upon the basis of the printed form, he does bind himself to any
  modification of the relations between himself and his broker which those
  rules may effect. The object of the principal clause in the above and
  similar printed forms is apparently to entitle the broker to sell to or
  buy from his principal on his own account and not as agent at all, thus
  disregarding the duty incumbent upon him as broker of making for his
  principal a contract with a third party.</p>

  <p>It is not possible, except very generally, to state how far exchanges
  have succeeded in imposing their own rules and usages on non-members, but
  it is probably correct to say that in most cases if the question came
  before the courts, the outside client would be held to have accepted the
  rules of the exchange so far as they did not alter the fundamental duties
  to him of his broker. On the other hand, provisions purporting to entitle
  the broker in disregard of his duties as broker himself to act as
  principal, would be rejected by the courts as radically inconsistent with
  the primary object of the contract of brokerage and, therefore,
  meaningless. But it is undoubtedly too often the practice of brokers who
  are members of exchanges to consider themselves entitled to act as
  principals and sell on their own account to their own clients,
  particularly in futures. The causes of this opinion, erroneously, though
  quite honestly held, are probably to be looked for partly in the habit of
  acting as principal on the market in accordance with the rules, partly in
  the forms of contract notes containing "principal clauses" which they
  send to their clients, and perhaps, also, in the occasional difficulty of
  effecting actual contracts on the market at the time when they are
  instructed so to do.</p>

  <p>A <i>stockbroker</i> is a broker who contracts for the sale of stocks
  and shares. Stockbrokers differ from brokers proper chiefly in that
  stocks and shares are not "goods," and the requirement of a memorandum in
  writing, enacted by the Sale of Goods Act 1893, does not apply. Hence
  actions may be brought by the principals to a contract for the sale of
  stocks and shares although no memorandum in writing exists. For instance,
  the jobber, on failing to recover from the buyer's broker the price of
  shares sold, by reason of the broker having failed and been declared a
  defaulter, may sue the buyer whose "name was passed" by the broker. The
  employment of a stockbroker is subject to the rules and customs of the
  Stock Exchange, in accordance with the principles discussed above, which
  apply to the employment of brokers proper. A custom which is illegal,
  such as the Stock Exchange practice of disregarding Leeman's Act (1867),
  which enacts that contracts for the sale of joint-stock bank shares shall
  be void unless the registered numbers of the shares are stated therein,
  is not binding on the client to the extent of making the contract of sale
  valid. But if a client choose to instruct his broker to buy bank shares
  in accordance with that practice, the broker is entitled to be
  indemnified by his client for money which he pays on his behalf, even
  though the contract of sale so made is unenforceable. For further
  information the reader is referred to the article <span class="sc">Stock
  Exchange</span> and to the treatises on stock exchange law.</p>

  <p>An <i>insurance broker</i> is an agent whose business is to effect
  policies of marine insurance. He is employed by the person who has an
  interest to insure, pays the premiums to the underwriter, takes up the
  policy, and receives from the underwriter payment in the event of a loss
  under the policy. By the custom of the trade the underwriter looks solely
  to the broker for payment of premiums, and has no right of action against
  the assured; and, on the other hand, the broker is paid his commission by
  the underwriter, although he is employed by the assured. Usually the
  broker keeps a current account with the underwriter, and premiums and
  losses are dealt with in account. It is only in the event of the
  underwriter refusing to pay on a loss, that the broker drops out and the
  assured sues the underwriter direct. Agents who effect life, fire or
  other policies, are not known as insurance brokers.</p>

  <p><i>Ship-brokers</i> are, firstly, "commission agents," and, secondly,
  very often also ships' managers. Their office is to act as agents for
  owners of ships to procure purchasers for ships, or ships for intending
  purchasers, in precisely the same manner as house-agents act in respect
  of houses. They also act as agents for ship-owners in finding charterers
  for their ships, or for charterers in finding ships available for
  charter, and in either case they effect the charter-party (see <span
  class="sc">Affreightment</span>).</p>

  <p>Chartering brokers are customarily paid by the ship-owner, when the
  charter-party is effected, whether originally employed by him or by the
  charterer. Charter-parties effected through brokers often contain a
  provision&mdash;"<i>2½% on estimated amount of freight to be paid to A B,
  broker, on the signing of this charter-party, and the ship to be
  consigned to him for ship's business at the port of X</i> [inserting the
  name of the port where A B carries on business]." The broker cannot sue
  on the charter-party contract because he is not a party to it, but the
  insertion of the clause practically prevents his right from being
  disputed by the ship-owner. When the broker does the ship's business in
  port, it is his duty to clear her at the customs and generally to act as
  "ship's husband."</p>

  <p>A <i>bill-broker</i> was originally an agent who, for a commission,
  procured for country bankers the discounting of their bills in London.
  But the practice arose of the broker guaranteeing the London banker or
  financier; and finally the brokers ceased to deposit with the London
  bankers the bills they received, and at the present day a bill-broker, as
  a rule, buys bills on his own account at a discount, borrows money on his
  own account and upon his own security at interest, and makes his profit
  out of the difference between the discount and the interest. When acting
  thus the bill-broker is not a broker at all, as he deals as principal and
  does not act as agent.</p>

  <p><b>BROMBERG,</b> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Posen,
  32 m. by rail W.N.W. from the fortress of Thorn, 7 m. W. from the bank of
  the Vistula, and at the centre of an important network of railways,
  connecting it with the strategical points on the Prusso-Russian frontier.
  Pop. (1900) 52,082; (1905) 54,229. Its public buildings comprise two
  Roman Catholic and three Protestant churches, a Jewish synagogue, a
  seminary, high grade schools and a theatre. The town also possesses a
  bronze statue of the emperor William I., a monument of the war of
  1870-71, and a statue of Benkenhoff, the constructor of the Bromberg
  Canal. This engineering work, constructed in 1773-1774, by command of
  Frederick II., connects the Brahe with the Netze, and thus establishes
  communication between the Vistula, the Oder and the Elbe. The principal
  industrial works are iron foundries and machine shops, paper factories
  and flour mills; the town has, moreover, an active trade in agricultural
  and other products. In view of its strategical position, a large garrison
  is concentrated in and about the town. Bromberg is mentioned as early as
  1252. It fell soon afterwards into the hands of the Poles, from whom it
  was taken in 1327 by the Teutonic Order, which held it till 1343, when
  the Poles recaptured it. Destroyed in the course of these struggles, it
  was restored by Casimir of Poland in 1346, and down to the close of the
  16th century it continued to be a flourishing commercial city. It
  afterwards suffered so much from war and pestilence that about 1772, when
  the Prussians took possession, it contained only from five to six hundred
  inhabitants. By the treaty of Tilsit it was transferred to the duchy of
  Warsaw; in 1813 it was occupied by the Russians, and in 1815 was restored
  to Prussia.</p>

  <p><b>BROME, ALEXANDER</b> (1620-1666), English poet, was by profession
  an attorney, and was the author of many drinking songs and of satirical
  verses in favour of the Royalists and against the Rump. He published in
  1661 <i>Songs and other Poems</i>, containing songs on various subjects,
  followed by a series of political songs; ballads, epistles, elegies and
  epitaphs; epigrams and translations. Izaak Walton wrote an introductory
  eclogue for this volume in praise of the writer, and his gaiety and wit
  won for him the title of the "English Anacreon" in Edward Phillips's
  <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i>. Brome published in 1666 a translation of Horace
  by himself and others, and was the author of a comedy entitled <i>The
  Cunning Lovers</i> (1654). He also edited two volumes of Richard Brome's
  plays.</p>

  <p><b>BROME, RICHARD</b> (d. 1652), English dramatist, was originally a
  servant of Ben Jonson, and owed much to his master. The development of
  his plots, the strongly marked characters and the amount of curious
  information to be found in his work, all show Jonson's influence. The
  relation of master and servant developed into friendship, and our
  knowledge of Brome's personal character is chiefly drawn from Ben
  Jonson's lines to him, prefixed to <i>The Northern Lasse</i> (1632), the
  play which made Brome's reputation. Brome's genius lay entirely in
  comedy. He has left fifteen pieces. <i>Five New Playes</i> (ed. by Alex.

  <p><b>BROMELIACEAE</b>, in botany, a natural order of Monocotyledons,
  confined to tropical and sub-tropical America. It includes the pine-apple
  (fig. 1) and the so-called Spanish moss (fig. 2), a rootless plant, which
  hangs in long grey lichen-like festoons from the branches of trees, a
  native of Mexico and the southern United States; the water required for
  food is absorbed from the moisture in the air by peculiar hairs which
  cover the surface of the shoots. The plants are generally herbs with a
  much shortened stem bearing a rosette of leaves and a spike or panicle of
  flowers. They are eminently dry-country plants (xerophytes); the narrow
  leaves are protected from loss of water by a thick cuticle, and have a
  well-developed sheath which embraces the stem and forms, with the sheaths
  of the other leaves of the rosette, a basin in which water collects, with
  fragments of rotting leaves and the like. Peculiar hairs are developed on
  the inner surface of the sheath by which the water and dissolved
  substances are absorbed, thus helping to feed the plant. The leaf-margins
  are often spiny, and the leaf-spines of <i>Puya chilensis</i> are used by
  the natives as fish-hooks. Several species are grown as hot-house plants
  for the bright colour of their flowers or flower-bracts, e.g. species of
  <i>Tillandsia</i>, <i>Billbergia</i>, <i>Aechmea</i> and others.</p>

  <p><b>BROMINE</b> (symbol Br, atomic weight 79.96), a chemical element of
  the halogen group, which takes its name from its pungent unpleasant smell
  (<span title="brômos" class="grk"
  >&beta;&rho;&#x1FF6;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, a stench). It was first
  isolated by A.J. Balard in 1826 from the salts in the waters of the
  Mediterranean. He established its elementary character, and his
  researches were amplified by K.J. Löwig (1803-1890) in <i>Das Brom und
  seine chemischen Verhaltnisse</i> (1829). Bromine does not occur in
  nature in the uncombined condition, but in combination with various
  metals is very widely but sparingly distributed. Potassium, sodium and
  magnesium bromides are found in mineral waters, in river and sea-water,
  and occasionally in marine plants and animals. Its chief commercial
  sources are the salt deposits at Stassfurt in Prussian Saxony, in which
  magnesium bromide is found associated with various chlorides, and the
  brines of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, U.S.A.; small
  quantities are obtained from the mother liquors of Chile saltpetre and
  kelp. In combination with silver it is found as the mineral bromargyrite
  (bromite).</p>

  <p><i>Manufacture.</i>&mdash;The chief centres of the bromine industry
  are Stassfurt and the central district of Michigan. It is manufactured
  from the magnesium bromide contained in "bittern" (the mother liquor of
  the salt industry), by two processes, the continuous and the periodic.
  The continuous process depends upon the decomposition of the bromide by
  chlorine, which is generated in special stills. A regular current of
  chlorine mixed with steam is led in at the bottom of a tall tower filled
  with broken bricks, and there meets a descending stream of hot bittern:
  bromine is liberated and is swept out of the tower together with some
  chlorine, by the current of steam, and then condensed in a worm. Any
  uncondensed bromine vapour is absorbed by moist iron borings, and the
  resulting iron bromide is used for the manufacture of potassium bromide.
  The periodic process depends on the interaction between manganese dioxide
  (pyrolusite), sulphuric acid, and a bromide, and the operation is carried
  out in sandstone stills heated to 60° C., the product being condensed as
  in the continuous process. The substitution of potassium chlorate for
  pyrolusite is recommended when calcium chloride is present in the
  bittern. The crude bromine is purified by repeated shaking with
  potassium, sodium or ferrous bromide and subsequent redistillation.
  Commercial bromine is rarely pure, the chief impurities present in it
  being chlorine, hydrobromic acid, and bromoform (M. Hermann,
  <i>Annalen</i>, 1855, 95, p. 211). E. Gessner (<i>Berichte</i>, 1876, 9,
  p. 1507) removes chlorine by repeated shaking with water, followed by
  distillation over sulphuric acid; hydrobromic acid is removed by
  distillation with pure manganese dioxide, or mercuric oxide, and the
  product dried over sulphuric acid. J.S. Stas, in his stoichiometric
  researches, prepared chemically pure bromine from potassium bromide, by
  converting it into the bromate which was purified by repeated
  crystallization. By heating the bromate it was partially converted into
  the bromide, and the resulting mixture was distilled with sulphuric acid.
  The distillate was further purified by digestion with milk of lime,
  precipitation with water, and further digestion with calcium bromide and
  barium oxide, and was finally redistilled.</p>

  <p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;Bromine at ordinary temperatures is a mobile
  liquid of fine red colour, which appears almost black in thick layers. It
  boils at 59° C. According to Sir W. Ramsay and S. Young, bromine, when
  dried over sulphuric acid, boils at 57.65° C., and when dried over
  phosphorus pentoxide, boils at 58.85° C. (under a pressure of 755.8 mm.),
  forming a deep red vapour, which exerts an irritating and directly
  poisonous action on the respiratory organs. It solidifies at -21° C.
  (Quincke) to a dark brown solid. Its specific gravity is 3.18828 (0/4°),
  latent heat of fusion 16.185 calories, latent heat of vaporization 45.6
  calories, specific heat 0.1071. The specific heat of bromine vapour, at
  constant pressure, is 0.05504 and at constant volume is 0.04251 (K.
  Strecker). Bromine is soluble in water, to the extent of 3.226 grammes of
  bromine per 100 grammes of solution at 15° C., the solubility being
  slightly increased by the presence of potassium bromide. The solution is
  of an orange-red colour, and is quite permanent in the dark, but on
  exposure to light, gradually becomes colourless, owing to decomposition
  into hydrobromic acid and oxygen. By cooling the aqueous solution,
  hyacinth-red octahedra of a crystalline hydrate of composition
  Br·4H<sub>2</sub>O or Br<sub>2</sub>·8H<sub>2</sub>O are obtained
  (Bakhuis Roozeboom, <i>Zeits. phys. Chem.</i>, 1888, 2. p. 449). Bromine
  is readily soluble in chloroform, alcohol and ether.</p>

  <p>Its chemical properties are in general intermediate between those of
  chlorine and iodine; thus it requires the presence of a catalytic agent,
  or a fairly high temperature, to bring about its union with hydrogen. It
  does not combine directly with oxygen, nitrogen or carbon. With the other
  elements it unites to form bromides, often with explosive violence;
  phosphorus detonates in liquid bromine and inflames in the vapour; iron
  is occasionally used to absorb bromine vapour, potassium reacts
  energetically, but sodium requires to be heated to 200° C. The chief use
  of bromine in analytical chemistry is based upon the oxidizing action of
  bromine water. Bromine and bromine water both bleach organic colouring
  matters. <!-- Page 633 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page633"></a>[v.04 p.0633]</span>The use of bromine in the
  extraction of gold (<i>q.v.</i>) was proposed by R. Wagner (<i>Dingler's
  Journal</i>, 218, p. 253) and others, but its cost has restricted its
  general application. Bromine is used extensively in organic chemistry as
  a substituting and oxidizing agent and also for the preparation of
  addition compounds. Reactions in which it is used in the liquid form, in
  vapour, in solution, and in the presence of the so-called "bromine
  carriers," have been studied. Sunlight affects the action of bromine
  vapour on organic compounds in various ways, sometimes retarding or
  accelerating the reaction, while in some cases the products are different
  (J. Schramm, <i>Monatshefte fur Chemie</i>, 1887, 8, p. 101). Some
  reactions, which are only possible by the aid of nascent bromine, are
  carried out by using solutions of sodium bromide and bromate, with the
  amount of sulphuric acid calculated according to the equation 5NaBr +
  NaBrO<sub>3</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 6NaHSO<sub>4</sub> +
  3H<sub>2</sub>O + 6Br. (German Patent, 26642.) The diluents in which
  bromine is employed are usually ether, chloroform, acetic acid,
  hydrochloric acid, carbon bisulphide and water, and, less commonly,
  alcohol, potassium bromide and hydrobromic acid; the excess of bromine
  being removed by heating, by sulphurous acid or by shaking with mercury.
  The choice of solvent is important, for the velocity of the reaction and
  the nature of the product may vary according to the solvent used, thus A.
  Baeyer and F. Blom found that on brominating orthoacetamido-acetophenone
  in presence of water or acetic acid, the bromine goes into the benzene
  nucleus, whilst in chloroform or sulphuric acid or by use of bromine
  vapour it goes into the side chain as well. The action of bromine is
  sometimes accelerated by the use of compounds which behave catalytically,
  the more important of these substances being iodine, iron, ferric
  chloride, ferric bromide, aluminium bromide and phosphorus. For oxidizing
  purposes bromine is generally employed in aqueous and in alkaline
  solutions, one of its most important applications being by Emil Fischer
  (<i>Berichte</i>, 1889, 22, p. 362) in his researches on the sugars. The
  atomic weight of bromine has been determined by J.S. Stas and C. Marignac
  from the analysis of potassium bromide, and of silver bromide. G.P.
  Baxter (<i>Zeit. anorg. Chem.</i> 1906, 50, p. 389) determined the ratios
  Ag: AgBr, and AgCl: Ag Br.</p>

  <p><i>Hydrobromic Acid.</i>&mdash;This acid, HBr, the only compound of
  hydrogen and bromine, is in many respects similar to hydrochloric acid,
  but is rather less stable. It may be prepared by passing hydrogen gas and
  bromine vapour through a tube containing a heated platinum spiral. It
  cannot be prepared with any degree of purity by the action of
  concentrated sulphuric acid on bromides, since secondary reactions take
  place, leading to the liberation of free bromine and formation of sulphur
  dioxide. The usual method employed for the preparation of the gas
  consists in dropping bromine on to a mixture of amorphous phosphorus and
  water, when a violent reaction takes place and the gas is rapidly
  liberated. It can be obtained also, although in a somewhat impure
  condition, by the direct action of bromine on various saturated
  hydrocarbons (e.g. paraffin-wax), while an aqueous solution may be
  obtained by passing sulphuretted hydrogen through bromine water.
  Alexander Scott (<i>Journal of Chem. Soc.</i>, 1900, 77, p. 648) prepares
  pure hydrobromic acid by covering bromine, which is contained in a large
  flask, with a layer of water, and passing sulphur dioxide into the water
  above the surface of the bromine, until the whole is of a pale yellow
  colour; the resulting solution is then distilled in a slow current of air
  and finally purified by distillation over barium bromide. At ordinary
  temperatures hydrobromic acid is a colourless gas which fumes strongly in
  moist air, and has an acid taste and reaction. It can be condensed to a
  liquid, which boils at -64.9° C. (under a pressure of 738.2 mm.), and, by
  still further cooling, gives colourless crystals which melt at -88.5° C.
  It is readily soluble in water, forming the aqueous acid, which when
  saturated at 0° C. has a specific gravity of 1.78. When boiled, the
  aqueous acid loses either acid or water until a solution of constant
  boiling point is obtained, containing 48% of the acid and boiling at 126°
  C. under atmospheric pressure; should the pressure, however, vary, the
  strength of the solution boiling at a constant temperature varies also.
  Hydrobromic acid is one of the "strong" acids, being ionized to a very
  large extent even in concentrated solution, as shown by the molecular
  conductivity increasing by only a small amount over a wide range of
  dilution.</p>

  <p><i>Bromides.</i>&mdash;Hydrobromic acid reacts with metallic oxides,
  hydroxides and carbonates to form bromides, which can in many cases be
  obtained also by the direct union of the metals with bromine. As a class,
  the metallic bromides are solids at ordinary temperatures, which fuse
  readily and volatilize on heating. The majority are soluble in water, the
  chief exceptions being silver bromide, mercurous bromide, palladious
  bromide and lead bromide; the last is, however, soluble in hot water.
  They are decomposed by chlorine, with liberation of bromine and formation
  of metallic chlorides; concentrated sulphuric acid also decomposes them,
  with formation of a metallic sulphate and liberation of bromine and
  sulphur dioxide. The non-metallic bromides are usually liquids, which are
  readily decomposed by water. Hydrobromic acid and its salts can be
  readily detected by the addition of chlorine water to their aqueous
  solutions, when bromine is liberated; or by warming with concentrated
  sulphuric acid and manganese dioxide, the same result being obtained.
  Silver nitrate in the presence of nitric acid gives with bromides a pale
  yellow precipitate of silver bromide, AgBr, which is sparingly soluble in
  ammonia. For their quantitative determination they are precipitated in
  nitric acid solution by means of silver nitrate, and the silver bromide
  well washed, dried and weighed.</p>

  <p>No oxides of bromine have as yet been isolated, but three oxy-acids
  are known, namely hypobromous acid, HBrO, bromous acid, HBrO<sub>2</sub>,
  and bromic acid, HBrO<sub>3</sub>. Hypobromous acid is obtained by
  shaking together bromine water and precipitated mercuric oxide, followed
  by distillation of the dilute solution <i>in vacuo</i> at low temperature
  (about 40° C.). It is a very unstable compound, breaking up, on heating,
  into bromine and oxygen. The aqueous solution is light yellow in colour,
  and possesses strong bleaching properties. Bromous acid is formed by
  adding bromine to a saturated solution of silver nitrate (A. H. Richards,
  <i>J. Soc Chem. Ind.</i>, 1906, 25, p. 4). Bromic acid is obtained by the
  addition of the calculated amount of sulphuric acid (previously diluted
  with water) to the barium salt; by the action of bromine on the silver
  salt, in the presence of water, 5AgBrO<sub>3</sub> + 3Br<sub>2</sub> +
  3H<sub>2</sub>O = 5AgBr + 6HBrO<sub>3</sub>, or by passing chlorine
  through a solution of bromine in water. The acid is only known in the
  form of its aqueous solution; this is, however, very unstable,
  decomposing on being heated to 100° C. into water, oxygen and bromine. By
  reducing agents such, for example, as sulphuretted hydrogen and
  sulphur-dioxide, it is rapidly converted into hydrobromic acid.
  Hydrobromic acid decomposes it according to the equation HBrO<sub>3</sub>
  + 5HBr = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 3Br<sub>2</sub>. Its salts are known as
  bromates, and are as a general rule difficultly soluble in water, and
  decomposed by heat, with evolution of oxygen.</p>

  <p><i>Applications.</i>&mdash;The salts of bromine are widely used in
  photography, especially bromide of silver. For antiseptic purposes it has
  been prepared as "bromum solidificatum," which consists of kieselguhr or
  similar substance impregnated with about 75% of its weight of bromine. In
  medicine it is largely employed in the form of bromides of potassium,
  sodium and ammonium, as well as in combination with alkaloids and other
  substances.</p>

  <p><i>Medicinal Use.</i>&mdash;Bromide of potassium is the safest and
  most generally applicable sedative of the nervous system. Whilst very
  weak, its action is perfectly balanced throughout all nervous tissue, so
  much so that Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton has suggested its action to be due
  to its replacement of sodium chloride (common salt) in the fluids of the
  nervous system. Hence bromide of potassium&mdash;or bromide of sodium,
  which is possibly somewhat safer still though not quite so certain in its
  action&mdash;is used as a hypnotic, as the standard anaphrodisiac, as a
  sedative in mania and all forms of morbid mental excitement, and in
  hyperaesthesia of all kinds. Its most striking success is in epilepsy,
  for which it is the specific remedy. It may be given in doses of from ten
  to fifty grains or more, and may be continued without ill effect for long
  periods in grave cases of epilepsy (<i>grand mal</i>). Of the three
  bromides in common use the potassium salt is the most rapid and certain
  in its action, but may depress the heart in morbid states of that organ;
  in such cases the sodium salt&mdash;of which the base is inert&mdash;may
  be employed. In whooping-cough, when a sedative is required but a
  stimulant is also indicated, ammonium bromide is often invaluable. The
  conditions in which bromides are most frequently used are insomnia,
  epilepsy, whooping-cough, delirium tremens, asthma, migraine, laryngismus
  stridulus, the symptoms often attendant upon the climacteric in women,
  hysteria, neuralgia, certain nervous disorders of the heart, strychnine
  poisoning, nymphomania and spermatorrhoea. Hydrobromic acid is often used
  to relieve or prevent the headache and singing in the ears that may
  follow the administration of quinine and of salicylic acid or
  salicylates.</p>

  <p><b>BROMLEY, SIR THOMAS</b> (1530-1587), English lord chancellor, was
  born in Staffordshire in 1530. He was educated at Oxford University and
  called to the bar at the Middle Temple. Through family influence as well
  as the patronage of Sir Nicholas Bacon, the lord keeper, he quickly made
  progress in his profession. In 1566 he was appointed recorder of London,
  and in 1569 he became solicitor-general. He sat in parliament
  successively for Bridgnorth, Wigan and Guildford. On the death of Sir
  Nicholas Bacon in 1579 he was appointed lord chancellor. As an equity
  judge he showed great and profound knowledge, and his judgment in
  Shelley's case (<i>q.v.</i>) is a landmark in the history of English real
  property law. He presided over the commission which tried Mary, queen of
  Scots, in 1586, but the strain of the trial, coupled with the
  responsibility which her execution involved upon him, proved too much for
  his strength, and he died on the 12th of April 1587. He was buried in
  Westminster Abbey.</p>

  is a chalybeate spring known as St Blaize's Well, which was in high
  repute before the Reformation. The church of St Peter and St Paul, mainly
  Perpendicular, retains a Norman font and other remains of an earlier

  <p><b>BROMLITE</b>, a member of the aragonite group of minerals. It
  consists of an isomorphous mixture of calcium and barium carbonates in
  various proportions, (Ca, Ba) CO<sub>3</sub>, and thus differs chemically
  from barytocalcite (<i>q.v.</i>) which is a double salt of these
  carbonates in equal molecular proportions. Being isomorphous with
  aragonite, it crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, but simple
  crystals are not known. The crystals are invariably complex twins, and
  have the form of doubly terminated pseudo-hexagonal pyramids, like those
  of witherite but more acute; the faces are horizontally striated and are
  divided down their centre by a twin-suture, as represented in the
  adjoining figure. The examination in polarized light of a transverse
  section shows that each compound crystal is built up of six differently
  orientated individuals arranged in twelve segments. The crystals are
  translucent and white, sometimes with a shade of pink. Sp. gr. 3.706;
  hardness 4-4½. The mineral has been found at only two localities, both of
  which are in the north of England. At the Fallowfield lead mine, near
  Hexham in Northumberland, it is associated with witherite; and at Bromley
  Hill, near Alston in Cumberland, it occurs in veins with galena. The
  species was named bromlite by T. Thomson in 1837, and alstonite by A.

  <p><b>BRONCHIECTASIS</b> (Gr. <span title="bronchia" class="grk"

  and <span title="ektasis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F12;&kappa;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, extension),
  dilatation of the bronchi, a condition occurring in connexion with many
  diseases of the lungs. Bronchitis both acute and chronic, chronic
  pneumonia and phthisis, acute pneumonia and broncho-pneumonia, may all
  leave after them a bronchiectasis whose position is determined by the
  primary lesion. Other causes, acting mechanically, are tracheal and
  bronchial obstruction, as from the pressure of an aneurism, new growth,
  &amp;c. It used to be considered a disease of middle age, but of late
  years Dr Walter Carr has shown that the condition is a fairly common one
  among debilitated children after measles, whooping cough, &amp;c. The
  dilatation is commonly cylindrical, more rarely saccular, and it is the
  medium and smaller sized tubes that are generally affected, except where
  the cause is mechanical. The affection is usually of one lung only.
  Emphysema is a very common accompaniment. Though at first the symptoms
  somewhat resemble those of bronchitis, later they are quite distinctive.
  Cough is very markedly paroxysmal in character, and though severe is
  intermittent, the patient being entirely free for many hours at the time.
  The effect of posture is very marked. If the patient lie on the affected
  side, he may be free from cough the whole night, but if he turn to the
  sound side, or if he rises and bends forward, he brings up large
  quantities of bronchial secretion. The expectoration is characterized by
  its abundance and manner of expulsion. Where the dilatation is of the
  saccular variety, it may come up in such quantities and with so much
  suddenness as to gush from the mouth. It is very commonly foetid, as it
  is retained and decomposed <i>in situ</i>. Dyspnoea and haemoptysis
  occasionally occur, but are by no means the rule. If pyrexia is present,
  it is a serious symptom, as it is a sign of septic absorption in the
  bronchi, and may be the forerunner of gangrene. If gangrene does set in,
  it will be accompanied by severe attacks of shivering and sweating. Where
  the disease has lasted long, clubbing of fingers and toes is very common.
  The diagnosis from putrid bronchitis is usually fairly easily made, but
  at times it may be a matter of extreme difficulty to distinguish between
  this condition and a tuberculous cavity in the lung. Nothing can be done
  directly to cure this disease, but the patient's condition can be greatly
  alleviated. Creosote vapour baths are eminently satisfactory. A
  mechanical treatment much recommended by some of the German physicians is
  that of forced expiration.</p>

  <p><b>BRONCHITIS,</b> the name given to inflammation of the mucous
  membrane of the bronchial tubes (see <span class="sc">Respiratory
  System</span>: <i>Pathology</i>). Two main varieties are described,
  specific and non-specific bronchitis. The bronchitis which occurs in
  infectious or specific disorders, as diphtheria, influenza, measles,
  pneumonia, &amp;c., due to the micro-organisms observed in these
  diseases, is known as specific; whereas that which results from extension
  from above, or from chemical or mechanical irritation, is known as
  non-specific. It is convenient to describe it, however, under the
  chemical divisions of <i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i> bronchitis.</p>

  <p><i>Acute bronchitis</i>, like other inflammatory affections of the
  chest, generally arises as the result of exposure to cold, particularly
  if accompanied with damp, or of sudden change from a heated to a cool
  atmosphere. The symptoms vary according to the severity of the attack,
  and more especially according to the extent to which the inflammatory
  action spreads in the bronchial tubes. The disease usually manifests
  itself at first in the form of a catarrh, or common cold; but the
  accompanying feverishness and general constitutional disturbance proclaim
  the attack to be something more severe, and symptoms denoting the onset
  of bronchitis soon present themselves. A short, painful, dry cough,
  accompanied with rapid and wheezing respiration, a feeling of rawness and
  pain in the throat and behind the breast bone, and of oppression or
  tightness throughout the chest, mark the early stages of the disease. In
  some cases, from the first, symptoms of the form of asthma (<i>q.v.</i>)
  known as the <i>bronchitic</i> are superadded, and greatly aggravate the
  patient's suffering.</p>

<p><!-- Page 635 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page635"></a>[v.04 p.0635]</span></p>

  <p>After a few days expectoration begins to come with the cough, at first
  scanty and viscid or frothy, but soon becoming copious and of purulent
  character. In general, after free expectoration has been established the
  more urgent and painful symptoms abate; and while the cough may persist
  for a length of time, often extending to three or four weeks, in the
  majority of instances convalescence advances, and the patient is
  ultimately restored to health, although there is not unfrequently left a
  tendency to a recurrence of the disease on exposure to its exciting
  causes.</p>

  <p>When the ear or the stethoscope is applied to the chest of a person
  suffering from such an attack as that now described, there are heard in
  the earlier stages snoring or cooing sounds, mixed up with others of
  wheezing or fine whistling quality, accompanying respiration. These are
  denominated dry sounds, and they are occasionally so abundant and
  distinct, as to convey their vibrations to the hand applied to the chest,
  as well as to be audible to a bystander at some distance. As the disease
  progresses these sounds become to a large extent replaced by others of
  crackling or bubbling character, which are termed moist sounds or râles.
  Both these kinds of abnormal sounds are readily explained by a reference
  to the pathological condition of the parts. One of the first effects of
  inflammation upon the bronchial mucous membrane is to cause some degree
  of swelling, which, together with the presence of a tough secretion
  closely adhering to it, tends to diminish the calibre of the tubes. The
  respired air as it passes over this surface gives rise to the dry or
  sonorous breath sounds, the coarser being generated in the large, and the
  finer or wheezing sounds in the small divisions of the bronchi. Before
  long, however, the discharge from the bronchial mucous membrane becomes
  more abundant and less glutinous, and accumulates in the tubes till
  dislodged by coughing. The respired air, as it passes through this fluid,
  causes the moist râles above described. In most instances both moist and
  dry sounds are heard abundantly in the same case, since different
  portions of the bronchial tubes are affected at different times in the
  course of the disease.</p>

  <p>Such are briefly the main characteristics presented by an ordinary
  attack of acute bronchitis running a favourable course. The case is,
  however, very different when the inflammation spreads into, or when it
  primarily affects, the minute ramifications of the bronchial tubes which
  are in immediate relation to the air-cells of the lungs, giving rise to
  that form of the disease known as <i>capillary bronchitis</i> or
  <i>broncho-pneumonia</i> (see <span class="sc">Respiratory System</span>:
  <i>Pathology</i>; and <span class="sc">Pneumonia</span>). When this takes
  place all the symptoms already detailed become greatly intensified, and
  the patient's life is placed in imminent peril in consequence of the
  interruption to the entrance of air into the lungs, and thus to the due
  aeration of the blood. The feverishness and restlessness increase, the
  cough becomes incessant, the respiration extremely rapid and laboured,
  the nostrils dilating with each effort, and evidence of impending
  suffocation appears. The surface of the body is pale or dusky, the lips
  are livid, while breathing becomes increasingly difficult, and is
  attended with suffocative paroxysms which render the recumbent posture
  impossible. Unless speedy relief is obtained by successful efforts to
  clear the chest by coughing and expectoration, the patient's strength
  gives way, somnolence and delirium set in and death ensues. All this may
  be brought about in the space of a few days, and such cases, particularly
  among the very young, sometimes prove fatal within forty-eight hours.</p>

  <p>Acute bronchitis must at all times be looked upon as a severe and even
  serious ailment, but there are certain circumstances under which its
  occurrence is a matter of special anxiety to the physician. It is
  pre-eminently dangerous at the extremes of life, and mortality statistics
  show it to be one of the most fatal of the diseases of those periods.
  This is to be explained not only by the well-recognized fact that all
  acute diseases tell with great severity on the feeble frames alike of
  infants and aged people, but more particularly by the tendency which
  bronchitis undoubtedly has in attacking them to assume the capillary
  form, and when it does so to prove quickly fatal. The importance,
  therefore, of early attention to the slightest evidence of bronchitis
  among the very young or the aged can scarcely be overrated.</p>

  <p>Bronchitis is also apt to be very severe when it occurs in persons who
  are addicted to intemperance. Again, in those who suffer from any disease
  affecting directly or indirectly the respiratory functions, such as
  consumption or heart disease, the supervention of an attack of acute
  bronchitis is an alarming complication, increasing, as it necessarily
  does, the <span class="correction" title="'embarassment' in original"
  >embarrassment</span> of breathing. The same remark is applicable to
  those numerous instances of its occurrence in children who are or have
  been suffering from such diseases as have always associated with them a
  certain degree of bronchial irritation, such as measles and
  whooping-cough.</p>

  <p>One other source of danger of a special character in bronchitis
  remains to be mentioned, viz. collapse of the lung. Occasionally a branch
  of a bronchial tube becomes plugged up with secretion, so that the area
  of the lung to which this branch conducts ceases to be inflated on
  inspiration. The small quantity of air imprisoned in the portion of lung
  gradually escapes, but no fresh air enters, and the part collapses and
  becomes of solid consistence. Increased difficulty of breathing is the
  result, and where a large portion of lung is affected by the plugging up
  of a large bronchus, a fatal result may rapidly follow, the danger being
  specially great in the case of children. Fortunately, the obstruction may
  sometimes be removed by vigorous coughing, and relief is then
  obtained.</p>

  <p>With respect to the treatment of acute bronchitis, in those mild cases
  which are more of the nature of a simple catarrh, little else will be
  found necessary than confinement in a warm room, or in bed, for a few
  days, and the use of light diet, together with warm diluent drinks.
  Additional measures are however called for when the disease is more
  markedly developed. Medicines to allay fever and promote perspiration are
  highly serviceable in the earlier stages. Later, with the view of
  soothing the pain of the cough, and favouring expectoration, mixtures of
  tolu, with the addition of some opiate, such as the ordinary paregorics,
  may be advantageously employed. The use of opium, however, in any form
  should not be resorted to in the case of young children without medical
  advice, since its action on them is much more potent and less under
  control than it is in adults. Not a few of the so-called "soothing
  mixtures" have been found to contain opium in quantity sufficient to
  prove dangerous when administered to children, and caution is necessary
  in using them.</p>

  <p>From the outset of the attack the employment of fomentations, or
  especially a turpentine stupe, gives great relief, and occasionally in
  the non-specific form this treatment, combined with a good dose of
  calomel and salts, may render the attack abortive. Some relief is always
  obtained by inhalations, and theoretically, an acute specific bronchitis
  should be successfully treated by inhalation of antiseptic and soothing
  remedies. In practice, however, it is found that the strength cannot be
  sufficiently strong to destroy the bacteria in the bronchial tubes.
  However, much relief is obtained from the use of steam atomizers filled
  with an aqueous solution of compound tincture of benzoin, creosote or
  guaiacol. A still more practicable means of introducing volatile
  antiseptic oils is the globe nebulizer, which throws oleaginous solutions
  in the form of a fine fog, that can be deeply inhaled. Menthol,
  eucalyptol and white pine extract are some of the remedies that may be
  tried dissolved in benzoinol, to which cocaine or opium may be added if
  the cough is troublesome.</p>

  <p>When the bronchitis is of the capillary form, the great object is to
  maintain the patient's strength, and to endeavour to secure the expulsion
  of the morbid secretion from the fine bronchi. In addition to the
  remedies already alluded to, stimulants are called for from the first;
  and should the cough be ineffectual in relieving the bronchial tubes, the
  administration of an emetic dose of sulphate of zinc may produce a good
  effect.</p>

  <p>During the whole course of any attack of bronchitis attention must be
  paid to the due nourishment of the patient; and during the subsequent
  convalescence, which, particularly in elderly persons, is apt to be slow,
  tonics and stimulants may have to be prescribed.</p>

<p><!-- Page 636 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page636"></a>[v.04 p.0636]</span></p>

  <p><i>Chronic bronchitis</i> may arise as the result of repeated attacks
  of the acute form, or it may exist altogether independently. It occurs
  more frequently among persons advanced in life than among the young,
  although no age is exempt from it. The usual history of this form of
  bronchitis is that of a cough recurring during the colder seasons of the
  year, and in its earlier stages, departing entirely in summer, so that it
  is frequently called "winter cough." In many persons subject to it,
  however, attacks are apt to be excited at any time by very slight causes,
  such as changes in the weather; and in advanced cases of the disease the
  cough is seldom altogether absent. The symptoms and auscultatory signs of
  chronic bronchitis are on the whole similar to those pertaining to the
  acute form, except that the febrile disturbance and pain are much less
  marked. The cough is usually more troublesome in the morning than during
  the day. There is usually free and copious expectoration, and
  occasionally this is so abundant as to constitute what is termed
  <i>bronchorrhoea</i>.</p>

  <p>Chronic bronchitis leads to alterations of structure in the affected
  bronchial tubes, their mucous membrane becoming thickened or even
  ulcerated, while occasionally permanent dilatation of the bronchi takes
  place, often accompanied with profuse foetid expectoration. In
  long-standing cases of chronic bronchitis the nutrition of the lungs
  becomes impaired, and dilatation of the air-tubes (<i>emphysema</i>) and
  other complications result, giving rise to more or less constant
  breathlessness.</p>

  <p>Chronic bronchitis may arise secondarily to some other ailment. This
  is especially the case in Bright's disease of the kidneys and in heart
  disease, of both of which maladies it often proves a serious
  complication, also in gout and syphilis. The influence of occupation is
  seen in the frequency in which persons following certain employments
  suffer from chronic bronchitis. Hirt has shown that the inhalation of
  vegetable dust is very liable to produce bronchitis through the
  irritation produced by the dust particles and the growth of organisms
  carried in with the dust. Consequently, millers and grain-shovellers are
  especially liable to it, while next in order come weavers and workers in
  cotton factories.</p>

  <p>The treatment to be adopted in chronic bronchitis depends upon the
  severity of the case, the age of the patient and the presence or absence
  of complications. Attention to the general health is a matter of prime
  importance in all cases of the disease, more particularly among persons
  whose avocations entail exposure, and tonics with cod-liver oil will be
  found highly advantageous. The use of a respirator in very cold or damp
  weather is a valuable means of protection. In those aggravated forms of
  chronic bronchitis, where the slightest exposure to cold air brings on
  fresh attacks, it may become necessary, where circumstances permit, to
  enjoin confinement to a warm room or removal to a more genial climate
  during the winter months.</p>

  <p><b>BRÖNDSTED, PETER OLUF</b> (1780-1842), Danish archaeologist and
  traveller, was born at Fruering in Jutland on the 17th of November 1780.
  After studying at the university of Copenhagen he visited Paris in 1806
  with his friend Georg Koes. After remaining there two years, they went
  together to Italy. Both were zealously attached to the study of
  antiquities; and congeniality of tastes and pursuits induced them, in
  1810, to join an expedition to Greece, where they excavated the temples
  of Zeus in Aegina and of Apollo at Bassae in Arcadia. After three years
  of active researches in Greece, Bröndsted returned to Copenhagen, where,
  as a reward for his labours, he was appointed professor of Greek in the
  university. He then began to arrange and prepare for publication the vast
  materials he had collected during his travels; but finding that
  Copenhagen did not afford him the desired facilities, he exchanged his
  professorship for the office of Danish envoy at the papal court in 1818,
  and took up his abode at Rome. In 1820 and 1821 he visited Sicily and the
  Ionian Isles to collect additional materials for his great work. In 1826
  he went to London, chiefly with a view of studying the Elgin marbles and
  other remains of antiquity in the British Museum, and became acquainted
  with the principal archaeologists of England. From 1828-1832 he resided
  in Paris, to superintend the publication of his <i>Travels</i>, and then
  returned to Copenhagen on being appointed director of the museum of
  antiquities and the collection of coins and medals. In 1842 he became
  rector of the university; but a fall from his horse caused his death on
  the 26th of June. His principal work was the <i>Travels and
  Archaeological Researches in Greece</i> (in German and French,
  1826-1830), of which only two volumes were published, dealing with the
  island of Ceos and the metopes of the Parthenon.</p>

  <p><b>BRONGNIART, ADOLPHE THÉODORE</b> (1801-1876), French botanist, son
  of the geologist Alexandre Brongniart, was born in Paris on the 14th of
  January 1801. He soon showed an inclination towards the study of natural
  science, devoting himself at first more particularly to geology, and
  later to botany, thus equipping himself for what was to be the main
  occupation of his life&mdash;the investigation of fossil plants. In 1826
  he graduated as doctor of medicine with a dissertation on the Rhamnaceae;
  but the career which he adopted was botanical, not medical. In 1831 he
  became assistant to R.L. Desfontaines at the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle,
  and two years later succeeded him as professor, a position which he
  continued to hold until his death in Paris on the 18th of February
  1876.</p>

  <p>Brongniart was an indefatigable investigator and a prolific writer, so
  that he left behind him, as the fruit of his labours, a large number of
  books and memoirs. As early as 1822 he published a paper on the
  classification and distribution of fossil plants (<i>Mém. Mus. Hist.
  Nat.</i> viii.). This was followed by several papers chiefly bearing upon
  the relation between extinct and existing forms&mdash;a line of research
  which culminated in the publication of the <i>Histoire des végétaux
  fossiles</i>, which has earned for him the title of "father of
  palaeobotany." This great work was heralded by a small but most important
  "Prodrome" (contributed to the <i>Grand Dictionnaire d'Hist. Nat.</i>,
  1828, t. lvii.) which brought order into chaos by a classification in
  which the fossil plants were arranged, with remarkably correct insight,
  along with their nearest living allies, and which forms the basis of all
  subsequent progress in this direction. It is of especial botanical
  interest, because, in accordance with Robert Brown's discoveries, the
  Cycadeae and Coniferae were placed in the new group <i>Phanérogames
  gymnospermes</i>. In this book attention was also directed to the
  succession of forms in the various geological periods, with the important
  result (stated in modern terms) that in the Palaeozoic period the
  Pteridophyta are found to predominate; in the Mesozoic, the Gymnosperms;
  in the Cainozoic, the Angiosperms, a result subsequently more fully
  stated in his "Tableau des genres de végétaux fossiles" (D'Orbigny,
  <i>Dict. Univ. d'Hist. Nat.</i>, 1849). But the great <i>Histoire</i>
  itself was not destined to be more than a colossal fragment; the
  publication of successive parts proceeded regularly from 1828 to 1837,
  when the first volume was completed, but after that only three parts of
  the second volume appeared. Brongniart, no doubt, was overwhelmed with
  the continually increasing magnitude of the task that he had undertaken.
  Apart from his more comprehensive works, his most important
  palaeontological contributions are perhaps his observations on the
  structure of <i>Sigillaria</i> (<i>Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat.</i> i., 1839)
  and his researches (almost the last he undertook) on fossil seeds, of
  which a full account was published posthumously in 1880. His activity was
  by no means confined to palaeobotany, but extended into all branches of
  botany, more particularly anatomy and phanerogamic taxonomy. Among his
  achievements in these directions the most notable is the memoir "Sur la
  génération et le développement de l'embryon des Phanérogames" (<i>Ann.
  Sci. Nat.</i> xii., 1827). This is remarkable in that it contains the
  <!-- Page 637 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page637"></a>[v.04
  p.0637]</span>first account of any value of the development of the
  pollen; as also a description of the structure of the pollen-grain, the
  confirmation of G. B. Amici's (1823) discovery of the pollen-tube, the
  confirmation of R. Brown's views as to the structure of the unimpregnated
  ovule (with the introduction of the term "sac embryonnaire"); and in that
  it shows how nearly Brongniart anticipated Amici's subsequent (1846)
  discovery of the entrance of the pollen-tube into the micropyle,
  fertilizing the female cell which then develops into the embryo. Of his
  anatomical works, those of the greatest value are probably the
  "<i>Recherches sur la structure et les fonctions des feuilles</i>"
  (<i>Ann. Sci. Nat.</i> xxi., 1830), and the "Nouvelles Recherches sur
  l'Épiderme" (<i>Ann. Sci. Nat.</i> i., 1834), in which, among other
  important observations, the discovery of the cuticle is recorded; and,
  further, the "Recherches sur l'organisation des tiges des Cycadées"
  (<i>Ann. Sci. Nat.</i> xvi., 1829), giving the results of the first
  investigation of the anatomy of those plants. His systematic work is
  represented by a large number of papers and monographs, many of which
  relate to the flora of New Caledonia; and by his <i>Énumération des
  genres de plantes cultivées au Musée d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris</i>
  (1843), which is an interesting landmark in the history of classification
  in that it forms the starting-point of the system, modified successively
  by A. Braun, A.W. Eichler and A. Engler, which is now adopted in Germany.
  In addition to his scientific and professorial labours, Brongniart held
  various important official posts in connexion with the department of
  education, and interested himself greatly in agricultural and
  horticultural matters. With J.V. Audouin and J.B.A. Dumas, his future
  brothers-in-law, he established the <i>Annales des Sciences
  Naturelles</i> in 1824; he also founded the Société Botanique de France
  in 1854, and was its first president.</p>

  <p><b>BRONGNIART, ALEXANDRE</b> (1770-1847), French mineralogist and
  geologist, son of the eminent architect who designed the Bourse and other
  public buildings of Paris, was born in that city on the 5th of February
  1770. At an early age he studied chemistry, under Lavoisier, and after
  passing through the École des Mines he took honours at the École de
  Médecine; subsequently he joined the army of the Pyrenees as
  <i>pharmacien</i>; but having committed some slight political offence, he
  was thrown into prison and detained there for some time. Soon after his
  release he was appointed professor of natural history in the Collège des
  Quatre Nations. In 1800 he was made director of the Sèvres porcelain
  factory, a post which he retained to his death, and in which he achieved
  his greatest work. In his hands Sèvres became the leading porcelain
  factory in Europe, and the researches of an able band of assistants
  enabled him to lay the foundations of ceramic chemistry. In addition to
  his work at Sèvres, quite enough to engross the entire energy of any
  ordinary man, he continued his more purely scientific work. He succeeded
  Haüy as professor of mineralogy in the Museum of Natural History; but he
  did not confine himself to mineralogy, for it is to him that we owe the
  division of Reptiles into the four orders of Saurians, Batrachians,
  Chelonians and Ophidians. Fossil as well as living animals engaged his
  attention, and in his studies of the strata around Paris he was
  instrumental in establishing the Tertiary formations. In 1816 he was
  elected to the Academy; and in the following year he visited the Alps of
  Switzerland and Italy, and afterwards Sweden and Norway. The result of
  his observations was published from time to time in the <i>Journal des
  Mines</i> and other scientific journals. Wide as was the range of his
  interests his most famous work was accomplished at Sèvres, and his most
  enduring monument is his classic <i>Traité des arts céramiques</i>
  (1844). He died in Paris on the 7th of October 1847.</p>

  <p>His other principal works are :&mdash;<i>Traité élémentaire de
  minéralogie, avec des applications aux arts</i> (2 vols., Paris, 1807);
  <i>Histoire naturelle des crustacés fossiles</i> (Paris, 1822);
  <i>Classification et caractères minéralogiques des roches homogènes et
  hétérogènes</i> (Paris, 1827); the <i>Tableau des terrains qui composent
  l'écorce du globe, ou Essai sur la structure de la partie connue de la
  terre</i> (Paris, 1829); and the <i>Traité des arts céramiques</i>
  (1844). Brongniart was also the coadjutor of Cuvier in the admirable
  <i>Essai sur la géographie minéralogique des environs de Paris</i>
  (Paris, 1811); originally published in <i>Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat.</i>
  (Paris, xi. 1808).</p>

  <p><b>BRONN, HEINRICH GEORG</b> (1800-1862), German geologist, was born
  on the 3rd of March 1800 at Ziegelhausen near Heidelberg. Studying at the
  university at Heidelberg he took his doctor's degree in the faculty of
  medicine in 1821, and in the following year was appointed professor of
  natural history. He now devoted himself to palaeontological studies, and
  to fieldwork in various parts of Germany, Italy and France. From its
  commencement in 1830 to 1862 he assisted in editing the <i>Jahrbuch für
  Mineralogie</i>, &amp;c., continued as <i>Neues Jahrbuch.</i> His
  principal work, <i>Lethaea Geognostica</i> (2 vols., Stuttgart,
  1834-1838; 3rd ed. with F. Römer, 3 vols., 1851-1856), has been regarded
  as one of the foundations of German stratigraphical geology. His
  <i>Handbuch einer Geschichte der Natur</i>, of which the first part was
  issued in 1841, gave a general account of the physical history of the
  earth, while the second part dealt with the life-history, species being
  regarded as direct acts of creation. The third part included his famous
  <i>Index Palaeontologicus</i>, and was issued in 3 vols., 1848-1849, with
  the assistance of H. von Meyer and H. R. Göppert. This record of fossils
  has proved of inestimable value to all palaeontologists. An important
  work on recent and fossil zoology, <i>Die Klassen und Ordnungen des
  Thier-Reichs</i>, was commenced by Bronn. He wrote the volumes dealing
  with Amorphozoa, Actinozoa, and Malacozoa, published 1859-1862; the work
  was continued by other naturalists. In 1861 Bronn was awarded the
  Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London. He died at
  Heidelberg on the 5th of July 1862.</p>

  <p><b>BRONSART VON SCHELLENDORF, PAUL</b> (1832-1891), Prussian general,
  was born at Danzig in 1832. He entered the Prussian Guards in 1849, and
  was appointed to the general staff in 1861 as a captain; after three
  years of staff service he returned to regimental duty, but was soon
  reappointed to the staff, and lectured at the war academy, becoming major
  in 1865 and lieut.-colonel in 1869. During the war of 1870 he was chief
  of a section on the Great General Staff, and conducted the preliminary
  negotiations for the surrender of the French at Sedan. After the war
  Bronsart was made a colonel and chief of staff of the Guard army corps,
  becoming major-general in 1876 and lieut.-general (with a division
  command) in 1881. Two years later he became war minister, and during his
  tenure of the post (1883-1889) many important reforms were carried out in
  the Prussian army, in particular the introduction of the magazine rifle.
  He was appointed in 1889 to command the I. army corps at Königsberg. He
  died on the 23rd of June 1891 at his estate near Braunsberg. Bronsart's
  military writings include two works of great importance&mdash;<i>Ein
  Rückblick auf die taktischen Ruckblicke</i> (2nd ed., Berlin, 1870), a
  pamphlet written in reply to Captain May's <i>Tactical Retrospect of
  1866</i>; and <i>Der Dienst des Generalstabes</i> (1st ed., Berlin, 1876;
  3rd ed. revised by General Meckel, 1893; new ed. by the author's son,
  Major Bronsart von Schellendorf, Berlin, 1904), a comprehensive treatise
  on the duties of the general staff. The third edition of this work was
  soon after its publication translated into English and issued officially
  to the British army as <i>The Duties of the General Staff</i>. Major
  Bronsart's new edition of 1904 was reissued in English by the General
  Staff, under the same title, in 1905.</p>

  <p><b>BRONTË, CHARLOTTE</b> (1816-1855), <b>EMILY</b> (1818-1848), and
  <b>ANNE</b> (1820-1849), English novelists, were three of the six
  children of Patrick Brontë, a clergyman of the Church of England, who for
  the last forty-one years of his life was perpetual incumbent of the
  parish of Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Patrick Brontë was
  born at Emsdale, Co. Down, Ireland, on the 17th of March 1777. His
  parents were of the peasant class, their original name of Brunty
  apparently having been changed by their son on his entry at St John's
  College, Cambridge, in 1802. In the intervening years he had been
  successively a weaver and schoolmaster in his native country. From
  Cambridge <!-- Page 638 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page638"></a>[v.04 p.0638]</span>he became a curate, first at
  Wethersfield in Essex, in 1806, then for a few months at Wellington,
  Salop, in 1809. At the end of 1809 he accepted a curacy at Dewsbury,
  Yorkshire, following up this by one at Hartshead-cum-Clifton in the same
  county. At Hartshead Patrick Brontë married in 1812 Maria Branwell, a
  Cornishwoman, and there two children were born to him, Maria (1813-1825)
  and Elizabeth (1814-1825). Thence Patrick Brontë removed to Thornton,
  some 3 m. from Bradford, and here his wife gave birth to four children,
  Charlotte, Patrick Branwell (1817-1848), Emily Jane, and Anne, three of
  whom were to attain literary distinction.</p>

  <p>In April 1820, three months after the birth of Anne Brontë, her father
  accepted the living of Haworth, a village near Keighley in Yorkshire,
  which will always be associated with the romantic story of the Brontës.
  In September of the following year his wife died. Maria Brontë lives for
  us in her daughter's biography only as the writer of certain letters to
  her "dear saucy Pat," as she calls her lover, and as the author of a
  recently published manuscript, an essay entitled <i>The Advantages of
  Poverty in Religious Concerns</i>, full of a sententiousness much
  affected at the time.</p>

  <p>Upon the death of Mrs Brontë her husband invited his sister-in-law,
  Elizabeth Branwell, to leave Penzance and to take up her residence with
  his family at Haworth. Miss Branwell accepted the trust and would seem to
  have watched over her nephew and five nieces with conscientious care. The
  two eldest of those nieces were not long in following their mother. Maria
  and Elizabeth, Charlotte and Emily, were all sent to the Clergy
  Daughters' school at Cowan Bridge in 1824, and Maria and Elizabeth
  returned home in the following year to die. How far the bad food and
  drastic discipline were responsible cannot be accurately demonstrated.
  Charlotte gibbeted the school long years afterwards in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
  under the thin disguise of "Lowood," and the principal, the Rev. William
  Carus Wilson (1792-1859), has been universally accepted as the
  counterpart of Mr Naomi Brocklehurst in the same novel. But congenital
  disease more probably accounts for the tragedy from which happily
  Charlotte and Emily escaped, both returning in 1825 to a prolonged home
  life at Haworth. Here the four surviving children amused themselves in
  intervals of study under their aunt's guidance with precocious literary
  aspirations. The many tiny booklets upon which they laboured in the
  succeeding years have been happily preserved. We find stories, verses and
  essays, all in the minutest handwriting, none giving any indication of
  the genius which in the case of two of the four children was to add to
  the indisputably permanent in literature.</p>

  <p>At sixteen years of age&mdash;in 1831&mdash;Charlotte Brontë became a
  pupil at the school of Miss Margaret Wooler (1792-1885) at Roe Head,
  Dewsbury. She left in the following year to assist in the education of
  the younger sisters, bringing with her much additional proficiency in
  drawing, French and composition; she took with her also the devoted
  friendship of two out of her ten fellow-pupils&mdash;Mary Taylor
  (1817-1893) and Ellen Nussey (1817-1897). With Miss Taylor and Miss
  Nussey she corresponded for the remainder of her life, and her letters to
  the latter make up no small part of what has been revealed to us of her
  life story. Her next three years at Haworth were varied by occasional
  visits to one or other of these friends. In 1835 she returned to Miss
  Wooler's school at Roe Head as a governess, her sister Emily accompanying
  her as a pupil, but remaining only three months, and Anne then taking her
  place. The year following the school was removed to Dewsbury. In 1838
  Charlotte went back to Haworth and soon afterwards received her first
  offer of marriage&mdash;from a clergyman, Henry Nussey, the brother of
  her friend Ellen. This was followed a little later by a second offer from
  a curate named Bryce. She refused both and took a situation as nursery
  governess, first with the Sidgwicks of Stonegappe, Yorkshire, and later
  with the Whites at Rawdon in the same county. A few months of this,
  however, filled her with an ambition to try and secure greater
  independence as the possessor of a school of her own, and she planned to
  acquire more proficiency in "languages" on the continent, as a
  preliminary step. The aunt advanced some money, and accompanied by her
  sister Emily she became in February 1842 a pupil at the Pensionnat Héger,
  Brussels. Here both girls worked hard, and won the goodwill and indeed
  admiration of the principal teacher, M. Héger, whose wife was at the head
  of the establishment. But the two girls were hastily called back to
  England before the year had expired by the announcement of the critical
  illness of their aunt. Miss Branwell died on the 29th of October 1842.
  She bequeathed sufficient money to her nieces to enable them to
  reconsider their plan of life. Instead of a school at Bridlington which
  had been talked of, they could now remain with their father, utilize
  their aunt's room as a classroom, and take pupils. But Charlotte was not
  yet satisfied with what the few months on Belgian soil had done for her,
  and determined to accept M. Héger's offer that she should return to
  Brussels as a governess. Hence the year 1843 was passed by her at the
  Pensionnat Héger in that capacity, and in this period she undoubtedly
  widened her intellectual sphere by reading the many books in French
  literature that her friend M. Héger lent her. But life took on a very
  sombre shade in the lonely environment in which she found herself. She
  became so depressed that on one occasion she took refuge in the
  confessional precisely as did her heroine Lucy Snowe in <i>Villette</i>.
  In 1844 she returned to her father's house at Haworth, and the three
  sisters began immediately to discuss the possibilities of converting the
  vicarage into a school. Prospectuses were issued, but no pupils were
  forthcoming.</p>

  <p>Matters were complicated by the fact that the only brother, Patrick
  Branwell, had about this time become a confirmed drunkard. Branwell had
  been the idol of his aunt and of his sisters. Educated under his father's
  care, he had early shown artistic leanings, and the slender resources of
  the family had been strained to provide him with the means of entering at
  the Royal Academy as a pupil. This was in 1835. Branwell, it would seem,
  indulged in a glorious month of extravagance in London and then returned
  home. His art studies were continued for a time at Leeds, but it may be
  assumed that no commissions came to him, and at last he became tutor to
  the son of a Mr Postlethwaite at Barrow-in-Furness. Ten months later he
  was a booking-clerk at Sowerby Bridge station on the Leeds &amp;
  Manchester railway, and later at Luddenden Foot. Then he became tutor in
  the family of a clergyman named Robinson at Thorp Green, where his sister
  Anne was governess. Finally he returned to Haworth to loaf at the village
  inn, shock his sisters by his excesses, and to fritter his life away in
  painful sottishness. He died in September 1848, having achieved nothing
  reputable, and having disappointed all the hopes that had been centred in
  him. "My poor father naturally thought more of his <i>only</i> son than
  of his daughters," is one of Charlotte's dreary comments on the tragedy.
  In early years he had himself written both prose and verse; and a foolish
  story invented long afterwards attributed to him some share in his
  sisters' novels, particularly in Emily Brontë's <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.
  But Charlotte distinctly tells us that her brother never knew that his
  sisters had published a line. He was too much under the effects of drink,
  too besotted and muddled in that last year or two of life, to have any
  share in their intellectual enthusiasms.</p>

  <p>The literary life had, however, opened bravely for the three girls
  during those years. In 1846 a volume of verse appeared from the shop of
  Aylott &amp; Jones of Paternoster Row; "<i>Poems</i>, by Currer, Ellis
  and Acton Bell," was on the title-page. These names disguised the
  identity of Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë. The venture cost the
  sisters about £50 in all, but only two copies were sold. There were
  nineteen poems by Charlotte, twenty-one by Emily, and the same number by
  Anne. A consensus of criticism has accepted the fact that Emily's verse
  alone revealed true poetic genius. This was unrecognized then except by
  her sister Charlotte. It is obvious now to all.</p>

  <p>The failure of the poems did not deter the authors from further
  effort. They had each a novel to dispose of. Charlotte Brontë's was
  called <i>The Master</i>, which before it was sent off to London was
  retitled <i>The Professor</i>. Emily's story was entitled <!-- Page 639
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page639"></a>[v.04
  p.0639]</span><i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and Anne's <i>Agnes Gray</i>. All
  these stories travelled from publisher to publisher. At last <i>The
  Professor</i> reached the firm of Smith, Elder &amp; Co., of Cornhill.
  The "reader" for that firm, R. Smith Williams (1800-1875), was impressed,
  as were also his employers. Charlotte Brontë received in August 1847 a
  letter informing her that whatever the merits of <i>The
  Professor</i>&mdash;and it was hinted that it lacked "varied
  interest"&mdash;it was too short for the three-volume form then counted
  imperative. The author was further told that a longer novel would be
  gladly considered. She replied in the same month with this longer novel,
  and <i>Jane Eyre</i> appeared in October 1847, to be wildly acclaimed on
  every hand, although enthusiasm was to receive a counterblast when more
  than a year later, in December 1848, Miss Rigby, afterwards Lady Eastlake
  (1809-1893), reviewed it in the <i>Quarterly</i>.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the novels of Emily and Anne had been accepted by T. C.
  Newby. They were published together in three volumes in December 1847,
  two months later than <i>Jane Eyre</i>, although the proof sheets had
  been passed by the authors before their sister's novel had been sent to
  the publishers. The dilatoriness of Mr Newby was followed up by
  considerable energy when he saw the possibility of the novels by Ellis
  and Acton Bell sailing on the wave of Currer Bell's popularity, and he
  would seem very quickly to have accepted another manuscript by Anne
  Brontë, for <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> was published by Newby in
  three volumes in June 1848. It was Newby's clever efforts to persuade the
  public that the books he published were by the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>
  that led Charlotte and Anne to visit London this summer and interview
  Charlotte's publishers in Cornhill with a view to establishing their
  separate identity. Soon after their return home Branwell died (the 24th
  of September 1848), and less than three months later Emily died also at
  Haworth (the 19th December 1848). Then Anne became ill and on the 24th of
  May 1849 Charlotte accompanied her to Scarborough in the hope that the
  sea air would revive her. Anne died there on the 28th of May, and was
  buried in Scarborough churchyard. Thus in exactly eight months Charlotte
  Brontë lost all the three companions of her youth, and returned to
  sustain her father, fast becoming blind, in the now desolate home at
  Haworth.</p>

  <p>In the interval between the death of Branwell and of Emily, Charlotte
  had been engaged upon a new novel&mdash;<i>Shirley</i>. Two-thirds were
  written, but the story was then laid aside while its author was nursing
  her sister Anne. She completed the book after Anne's death, and it was
  published in October 1849. The following winter she visited London as the
  guest of her publisher, Mr George Smith, and was introduced to
  Thackerary, to whom she had dedicated <i>Jane Eyre</i>. The following
  year she repeated the visit, sat for her portrait to George Richmond, and
  was considerably lionized by a host of admirers. In August 1850 she
  visited the English lakes as the guest of Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, and
  met Mrs Gaskell, Miss Martineau, Matthew Arnold and other interesting men
  and women. During this period her publishers assiduously lent her books,
  and her criticisms of them contained in many letters to Mr George Smith
  and Mr Smith Williams make very interesting reading. In 1851 she received
  a third offer of marriage, this time from Mr James Taylor, who was in the
  employment of her publishers. A visit to Miss Martineau at Ambleside and
  also to London to the Great Exhibition made up the events of this year.
  On her way home she visited Manchester and spent two days with Mrs
  Gaskell. During the year 1852 she worked hard with a new novel,
  <i>Villette</i>, which was published in January of 1853. In September of
  that year she received a visit from Mrs Gaskell at Haworth; in May 1854
  she returned it, remaining three days at Manchester, and planning with
  her hostess the details of her marriage, for at this time she had
  promised to unite herself with her father's curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls
  (1817-1906), who had long been a pertinacious suitor for her hand but had
  been discouraged by Mr Brontë. The marriage took place in Haworth church
  on the 29th of June 1854, the ceremony being performed by the Rev.
  Sutcliffe Sowden, Miss Wooler and Miss Nussey acting as witnesses. The
  wedded pair spent their honeymoon in Ireland, returning to Haworth, where
  they made their home with Mr Brontë, Mr Nicholls having pledged himself
  to continue in his position as curate to his father-in-law. After less
  than a year of married life, however, Charlotte Nicholls died of an
  illness incidental to childbirth, on the 31st of March 1855. She was
  buried in Haworth church by the side of her mother, Branwell and Emily.
  The father followed in 1861, and then her husband returned to Ireland,
  where he remained some years afterwards, dying in 1906.</p>

  <p>The bare recital of the Brontë story can give no idea of its undying
  interest, its exceeding pathos. Their life as told by their biographer
  Mrs Gaskell is as interesting as any novel. Their achievement, however,
  will stand on its own merits. Anne Brontë's two novels, it is true,
  though constantly reprinted, survive principally through the exceeding
  vitality of the Brontë tradition. As a hymn writer she still has a place
  in most religious communities. Emily is great alike as a novelist and as
  a poet. Her "Old Stoic" and "Last Lines" are probably the finest
  achievement of poetry that any woman has given to English literature. Her
  novel <i>Wuthering Heights</i> stands alone as a monument of intensity
  owing nothing to tradition, nothing to the achievement of earlier
  writers. It was a thing apart, passionate, unforgettable, haunting in its
  grimness, its grey melancholy. Among women writers Emily Brontë has a
  sure and certain place for all time. As a poet or maker of verse
  Charlotte Brontë is undistinguished, but there are passages of pure
  poetry of great magnificence in her four novels, and particularly in
  <i>Villette</i>. The novels <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Villette</i> will
  always command attention whatever the future of English fiction, by
  virtue of their intensity, their independence, their rough
  individuality.</p>

  <p>The <i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i>, by Mrs Gaskell, was first
  published in 1857. Owing to the many controversial questions it aroused,
  as to the identity of Lowood in <i>Jane Eyre</i> with Cowan Bridge
  school, as to the relations of Branwell Brontë with his employer's wife,
  as to the supposed peculiarities of Mr Brontë, and certain other minor
  points, the third edition was considerably changed. The <i>Life</i> has
  been many times reprinted, but may be read in its most satisfactory form
  in the Haworth edition (1902), issued by the original publishers, Smith,
  Elder &amp; Co. To this edition are attached a great number of letters
  written by Miss Brontë to her publisher, George Smith. The first new
  material supplied to supplement Mrs Gaskell's <i>Life</i> was contained
  in <i>Charlotte Brontë: a Monograph</i>, by T. Wemyss Reid (1877). This
  book inspired Mr A.C. Swinburne to issue separately a forcible essay on
  Charlotte and Emily Brontë, under the title of <i>A Note on Charlotte
  Brontë</i> (1877). A further collection of letters written by Miss Brontë
  was contained in <i>Charlotte Brontë and her Circle</i>, by Clement
  Shorter (1896), and interesting details can be gathered from the <i>Life
  of Charlotte Brontë</i>, by Augustine Birrell (1887), <i>The Brontës in
  Ireland</i>, by William Wright, D.D. (1893), <i>Charlotte Brontë and her
  Sisters</i>, by Clement Shorter (1906), and the Brontë Society
  publications, edited by Butler Wood (1895-1907). Miss A. Mary F. Robinson
  (Madame Duclaux) wrote a separate biography of Emily Brontë in 1883, and
  an essay in her <i>Grands Écrivains d'outre-Manche</i>. <i>The Brontës:
  Life and Letters</i>, by Clement Shorter (1907), contains the whole of C.
  Brontë's letters in chronological order.</p>

  <p>(C. K. S.)</p>

  <p><b>BRONTE,</b> a town of the province of Catania, Sicily, on the
  western slopes of Mt. Etna, 24 m. N.N.W. of Catania direct, and 34 m. by
  rail. Pop. (1901) 20,366. It was founded by the emperor Charles V. The
  town, with an extensive estate which originally belonged to the monastery
  of Maniacium (Maniace), was granted, as a dukedom, to Nelson by Ferdinand
  IV. of Naples in 1799.</p>

  <p><b>BRONX, THE,</b> formerly a district comprising several towns in
  Westchester county, New York, U.S.A., now (since 1898) the northernmost
  of the five boroughs of New York City (<i>q.v.</i>). Several settlements
  in the Bronx were made by the English and the Dutch between 1640 and
  1650.</p>

  <p><b>BRONZE,</b> an alloy formed wholly or chiefly of copper and tin in
  variable proportions. The word has been etymologically connected with the
  same root as appears in "brown," but according to M.P.E. Berthelot (<i>La
  Chimie au moyen âge</i>) it is a place-name derived from <i>aes
  Brundusianum</i> (cf. Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> xxxiii. ch. ix. §45,
  "specula optima apud majores fuerunt Brundusiana, stanno et aere
  mixtis"). A Greek MS. of about the 11th century in the library of St
  Mark's, Venice, contains <!-- Page 640 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page640"></a>[v.04 p.0640]</span>the form <span title="brontêsion" class="grk"
  >&beta;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&#x1F75;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
  and gives the composition of the alloy as 1 lb of copper with 2 oz. of
  tin. The product obtained by adding tin to copper is more fusible than
  copper and thus better suited for casting; it is also harder and less
  malleable. A soft bronze or <i>gun-metal</i> is formed with 16 parts of
  copper to 1 of tin, and a harder gun-metal, such as was used for bronze
  ordnance, when the proportion of tin is about doubled. The <i>steel
  bronze</i> of Colonel Franz Uchatius (1811-1881) consisted of copper
  alloyed with 8% of tin, the tenacity and hardness being increased by
  cold-rolling. Bronze containing about 7 parts of copper to 1 of tin is
  hard, brittle and sonorous, and can be tempered to take a fine edge.
  <i>Bell-metal</i> varies considerably in composition, from about 3 to 5
  parts of copper to 1 of tin. In <i>speculum metal</i> there are 2 to 2½
  parts of copper to 1 of tin. Statuary bronze may contain from 80 to 90%
  of copper, the residue being tin, or tin with zinc and lead in various
  proportions. The bronze used for the British and French copper coinage
  consists of 95% copper, 4% tin and 1% zinc. Many copper-tin alloys
  employed for machinery-bearings contain a small proportion of zinc, which
  gives increased hardness. "Anti-friction metals," also used in bearings,
  are copper-tin alloys in which the amount of copper is small and there is
  antimony in addition. Of this class an example is "Babbitt's metal,"
  invented by Isaac Babbitt (1799-1862); it originally consisted of 24
  parts of tin, 8 parts of antimony and 4 parts of copper, but in later
  compositions for the same purpose the proportion of tin is often
  considerably higher. Bronze is improved in quality and strength when
  fluxed with phosphorus. Alloys prepared in this way, and known as
  <i>phosphor bronze</i>, may contain only about 1% of phosphorus in the
  ingot, reduced to a mere trace after casting, but their value is
  nevertheless enhanced for purposes in which a hard strong metal is
  required, as for pump plungers, valves, the bushes of bearings, &amp;c.
  Bronze again is improved by the presence of manganese in small quantity,
  and various grades of <i>manganese bronze</i>, in some of which there is
  little or no tin but a considerable percentage of zinc, are extensively
  used in mechanical engineering. Alloys of copper with aluminium, though
  often nearly or completely destitute of tin, are known as <i>aluminium
  bronze</i>, and are valuable for their strength and the resistance they
  offer to corrosion. By the addition of a small quantity of silicon the
  tensile strength of copper is much increased; a sample of such <i>silicon
  bronze</i>, used for telegraph wires, on analysis was found to consist of
  99.94% of copper, 0.03% of tin, and traces of iron and silicon.</p>

  <p>The bronze (Gr. <span title="chalkos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, Lat. <i>aes</i>) of
  classical antiquity consisted chiefly of copper, alloyed with one or more
  of the metals, zinc, tin, lead and silver, in proportions that varied as
  times changed, or according to the purposes for which the alloy was
  required. Among bronze remains the copper is found to vary from 67 to
  95%. From the analysis of coins it appears that for their bronze coins
  the Greeks adhered to an alloy of copper and tin till 400 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, after which time they used also lead with
  increasing frequency. Silver is rare in their bronze coins. The Romans
  also used lead as an alloy in their bronze coins, but gradually reduced
  the quantity, and under Caligula, Nero, Vespasian and Domitian, coined
  pure copper coins; afterwards they reverted to the mixture of lead. So
  far the words <span title="chalkos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> and <i>aes</i> may be
  translated as bronze. Originally, no doubt, <span title="chalkos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> was the name for pure
  copper. It is so employed by Homer, who calls it <span title="eruthros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&rho;&upsilon;&theta;&rho;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> (red), <span
  title="aithups" class="grk">&alpha;&#x1F34;&theta;&upsilon;&psi;</span>
  (glittering), <span title="phaennos" class="grk"
  >&phi;&alpha;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> (shining), terms
  which apply only to copper. But instead of its following from this that
  the process of alloying copper with other metals was not practised in the
  time of the poet, or was unknown to him, the contrary would seem to be
  the case from the passage (<i>Iliad</i> xviii. 474) where he describes
  Hephaestus as throwing into his furnace copper, tin, silver and gold to
  make the shield of Achilles, so that it is not always possible to know
  whether when he uses the word <span title="chalkos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> he means copper pure
  or alloyed. Still more difficult is it to make this distinction when we
  read of the mythical Dactyls of Ida in Crete or the Telchines or Cyclopes
  being acquainted with the smelting of <span title="chalkos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>. It is not, however,
  likely that later Greek writers, who knew bronze in its true sense, and
  called it <span title="chalkos" class="grk"
  >&chi;&alpha;&lambda;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, would have employed
  this word without qualification for objects which they had seen unless
  they had meant it to be taken as bronze. When Pausanias (iii. 17. 6)
  speaks of a statue, one of the oldest figures he had seen of this
  material, made of separate pieces fastened together with nails, we
  understand him to mean literally bronze, the more readily since there
  exist very early figures and utensils of bronze so made.</p>

  <p><b>BRONZE AGE,</b> the name given by archaeologists to that stage in
  human culture, intermediate between the Stone and Iron Ages, when
  weapons, utensils and implements were, as a general rule, made of bronze.
  The term has no absolute chronological value, but marks a period of
  civilization through which it is believed that most races passed at one
  time or another. The "finds" of stone and bronze, of bronze and iron, and
  even of stone and iron implements together in tumuli and sepulchral
  mounds, suggest that in many countries the three stages in man's progress
  overlapped. From the similarity of types of weapons and implements of the
  period found throughout Europe a relatively synchronous commencement has
  been inferred for the Bronze Age in Europe, fixed by most authorities at
  between 2000 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to 1800 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> But it must have been earlier in some countries,
  and is certainly known to have been later in others; while the Mexicans
  and Peruvians were still in their bronze age in recent times. Not a few
  archaeologists have denied that there ever was a distinct Bronze Age.
  They have found their chief argument in the fact that weapons of these
  ages have been found side by side in prehistoric burial-places. But when
  it is admitted that the ages must have overlapped, it is fairly easy to
  undertand the mixed "finds." The beginning, the prevalence and duration
  of the Bronze Age in each country would have been ordered by the
  accessibility of the metals which form the alloy. Thus in some lands
  bronze may have continued to be a substance of extreme value until the
  Iron Age was reached, and in tumuli in which more than one body was
  interred, as was frequently the case, it would only be with the remains
  of the richer tenants of the tomb that the more valuable objects would be
  placed. There is, moreover, much reason to believe that sepulchral mounds
  were opened from age to age and fresh interments made, and in such a
  practice would be found a simple explanation of the mixing of implements.
  Another curious fact has been seized on by those who argue against the
  existence of a Bronze Age. Among all the "finds" examined in Europe there
  is a most remarkable absence of copper implements. The sources of tin in
  Europe are practically restricted to Cornwall and Saxony. How then are we
  to explain on the one hand the apparent stride made by primitive man when
  from a Stone Age civilization he passed to a comparatively advanced
  metallurgical skill? On the other, how account for a comparatively
  synchronous commencement of bronze civilization when one at least of the
  metals needed for the alloy would have been naturally difficult of
  access, if not unknown to many races? The answer is that there can be but
  little doubt that the knowledge of bronze came to the races of Europe
  from outside. Either by the Phoenicians or by the Greeks metallurgy was
  taught to men who no sooner recognized the nature and malleable
  properties of copper than they learnt that by application of heat a
  substance could be manufactured with tin far better suited to their
  purposes. Copper would thus have been but seldom used unalloyed; and the
  relatively synchronous appearance of bronze in Europe, and the scanty
  "finds" of copper implements, are explained. We may conclude then that
  there was a Bronze Age in most countries; that it was the direct result
  of increasing intercommunication of races and the spread of commerce; and
  that the discovery of metals was due to information brought to Stone-Age
  man in Europe by races which were already skilful metallurgists.</p>

  <p>The Bronze Age in Europe is characterized by weapons, utensils and
  implements, distinct in design and size from those in use in the
  preceding or succeeding stage of man's civilization. Moreover&mdash;and
  this has been employed as an argument in favour of the foreign origin of
  the knowledge of bronze&mdash;all the <!-- Page 641 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page641"></a>[v.04 p.0641]</span>objects in one
  part of Europe are identical in pattern and size with those found in
  another part. The implements of the Bronze Age include swords, awls,
  knives, gouges, hammers, daggers and arrow-heads. A remarkable
  confirmation of the theory that the Bronze Age culture came from the East
  is to be found in the patterns of the arms, which are distinctly
  oriental; while the handles of swords and daggers are so narrow and short
  as to make it unlikely that they would be made for use by the
  large-handed races of Europe. The Bronze Age is also characterized by the
  fact that cremation was the mode of disposal of the dead, whereas in the
  Stone Age burial was the rule. Barrows and sepulchral mounds strictly of
  the Bronze Age are smaller and less imposing than those of the Stone Age.
  Besides varied and beautiful weapons, frequently exhibiting high
  workmanship, amulets, coronets, diadems of solid gold, and vases of
  elegant form and ornamentation in gold and bronze are found in the
  barrows. These latter appear to have been used as tribal or family
  cemeteries. In Denmark as many as seventy deposits of burnt bones have
  been found in a single mound, indicating its use through a long
  succession of years. The ornamentation of the period is as a rule
  confined to spirals, bosses and concentric circles. What is remarkable is
  that the swords not only show the design of the cross in the shape of the
  handle, but also in tracery what is believed to be an imitation of the
  Svastika, that ancient Aryan symbol which was probably the first to be
  made with a definite intention and a consecutive meaning. The pottery is
  all "hand-made," and the bulk of the objects excavated are cinerary urns,
  usually found full of burnt bones. These vary from 12 to 18 in. in
  height. Their decoration is confined to a band round the upper part of
  the pot, or often only a projecting flange lapped round the whole rim. A
  few have small handles, formed of pierced knobs of clay and sometimes
  projecting rolls of clay, looped, as it were, all round the urn. The
  ornamentation consists of dots, zigzags, chevrons or crosses. The lines
  were frequently made by pressing a twisted thong of skin against the
  moist clay; the patterns in all cases being stamped into the pot before
  it was hardened by fire.</p>

  <p><b>BRONZING,</b> a process by which a bronze-like surface is imparted
  to objects of metal, plaster, wood, &amp;c. On metals a green bronze
  colour is sometimes produced by the action of such substances as vinegar,
  dilute nitric acid and sal-ammoniac. An antique appearance may be given
  to new bronze articles by brushing over the clean bright metal with a
  solution of sal-ammoniac and salt of sorrel in vinegar, and rubbing the
  surface dry, the operation being repeated as often as necessary. Another
  solution for the same purpose is made with sal-ammoniac, cream of tartar,
  common salt and silver nitrate. With a solution of platinic chloride
  almost any colour can be produced on copper, iron, brass or new bronze,
  according to the dilution and the number of applications. Articles of
  plaster and wood may be bronzed by coating them with size and then
  covering them with a bronze powder, such as Dutch metal, beaten into fine
  leaves and powdered. The bronzing of gun-barrels may be effected by the
  use of a strong solution of antimony trichloride.</p>

  <p><b>BRONZINO, IL,</b> the name given to <span class="sc">Angelo
  Allori</span> (1502-1572), the Florentine painter. He became the
  favourite pupil of J. da Pontormo. He painted the portraits of some of
  the most famous men of his day, such as Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio.
  Most of his best works are in Florence, but examples are in the National
  Gallery, London, and elsewhere.</p>

  <p><b>BRONZITE,</b> a member of the pyroxene group of minerals, belonging
  with enstatite and hypersthene to the orthorhombic series of the group.
  Rather than a distinct species, it is really a ferriferous variety of
  enstatite, which owing to partial alteration has acquired a bronze-like
  sub-metallic lustre on the cleavage surfaces. Enstatite is magnesium
  metasilicate, MgSiO<sub>3</sub>, with the magnesia partly replaced by
  small amounts (up to about 5%) of ferrous oxide; in the bronzite variety,
  (Mg,Fe)SiO<sub>3</sub>, the ferrous oxide ranges from about 5 to 14%, and
  with still more iron there is a passage to hypersthene. The ferriferous
  varieties are liable to a particular kind of alteration, known as
  "schillerization," which results in the separation of the iron as very
  fine films of oxide and hydroxides along the cleavage cracks of the
  mineral. The cleavage surfaces therefore exhibit a metallic sheen or
  "schiller," which is even more pronounced in hypersthene than in
  bronzite. The colour of bronzite is green or brown; its specific gravity
  is about 3.2-3.3, varying with the amount of iron present. Like
  enstatite, bronzite is a constituent of many basic igneous rocks, such as
  norites, gabbros, and especially peridotites, and of the serpentines
  which have been derived from them. It also occurs in some crystalline
  schists.</p>

  <p>Bronzite is sometimes cut and polished, usually in convex forms, for
  small ornamental objects, but its use for this purpose is less extensive
  than that of hypersthene. It often has a more or less distinct fibrous
  structure, and when this is pronounced the sheen has a certain
  resemblance to that of cat's-eye. Masses sufficiently large for cutting
  are found in the norite of the Kupferberg in the Fichtelgebirge, and in
  the serpentine of Kraubat near Leoben in Styria. In this connexion
  mention may be made of an altered form of enstatite or bronzite known as
  <i>bastite</i> or <i>schiller-spar</i>. Here, in addition to
  schillerization, the original enstatite has been altered by hydration and
  the product has approximately the composition of serpentine. In colour
  bastite is brown or green with the same metallic sheen as bronzite. The
  typical locality is Baste in the Radauthal, Harz, where patches of pale
  greyish-green bastite are embedded in a darker-coloured serpentine. This
  rock when cut and polished makes an effective decorative stone, although
  little used for that purpose.</p>

  <p><b>BROOCH,</b> or <span class="sc">Broach</span> (from the Fr.
  <i>broche</i>, originally an awl or bodkin; a spit is sometimes called a
  broach, and hence the phrase "to broach a barrel"; see <span
  class="sc">Broker</span>), a term now used to denote a clasp or fastener
  for the dress, provided with a pin, having a hinge or spring at one end,
  and a catch or loop at the other.</p>

  <p>Brooches of the safety-pin type (<i>fibulae</i>) were extensively used
  in antiquity, but only within definite limits of time and place. They
  seem to have been unknown to the Egyptians, and to the oriental nations
  untouched by Greek influence. In lands adjacent to Greece, they do not
  occur in Crete or at Hissarlik. The place of origin cannot as yet be
  exactly determined, but it would seem to have been in central Europe,
  towards the close of the Bronze Age, somewhat before 1000 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> The earliest form is little more than a pin,
  bent round for security, with the point caught against the head. One such
  actual pin has been found. In its next simplest form, very similar to
  that of the modern safety-pin (in which the coiled spring forces the
  point against the catch), it occurs in the lower city of Mycenae, and in
  late deposits of the Mycenaean Age, such as at Enkomi in Cyprus. It
  occurs also (though rarely) in the "terramare" deposits of the Po valley,
  in the Swiss lake-dwellings of the later Bronze Age, in central Italy, in
  Hungary and in Bosnia. (fig. 1).<a name="FnAnchor_151"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Early type from Peschiera.
  </div>
  <p>From the comparatively simple initial form, the fibula developed in
  different lines of descent, into different shapes, varying according to
  the structural feature which was emphasized. On account of the number of
  local variations, the subject is extremely complex, but the main lines of
  development were approximately as follows.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the Bronze Age the safety-pin was arched into a
  bow, so as to include a greater amount of stuff in its compass.</p>

  <p>In the older Iron Age or "Hallstatt period" the bow and its
  accessories are thickened and modified in various directions, so as to
  give greater rigidity, and prominences or surfaces for decoration. The
  chief types have been conveniently classed by <!-- Page 642 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page642"></a>[v.04 p.0642]</span>Montelius in
  four main groups, according to the characteristic forms:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. The wire of the catch-plate is hammered into a flat disk, on which
  the pin rests (fig. 2)</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/brooch_2.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/brooch_2.png"

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Type I. with disk
    for catch-plate.</p>
  </div>
  <p>II. The bow is thickened towards the middle, so as to assume the
  "leech" shape, or it is hollowed out underneath, into the "boat" form.
  The catch-plate is only slightly turned up, but it becomes elongated, in
  order to mask the end of a long pin (fig. 3).</p>

  <p>III. The catch-plate is flattened out as in group I., but additional
  convolutions are added to the bow (fig. 4).</p>

  <p>IV. The bow is convoluted (but the convolutions are sometimes
  represented by knobs); the catch-plate develops as in group II. (fig. 5).
  For further examples of the four types, see <i>Antiquities of Early Iron
  Age in British Museum</i>, p. 32.</p>

  <p>Among the special variations of the early form, mention should be made
  of the fibulae of the geometric age of Greece, with an exaggerated
  development of the vertical portion of the catch-plate (fig. 6).</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:22%;">
      <a href="images/brooch_3.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/brooch_3.png"

    turned-up and elongated catch-plate. <i>a</i>, "Leech" fibula;
    <i>b</i>, "Boat" fibula; <i>c.</i> variation of "Boat" fibula.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The example shown in fig. 7 is an ornate development of type II.
  above.</p>

  <p>In the later Iron Age (or early La Tène period) the prolongation of
  the catch-plate described in the second and fourth groups above has a
  terminal knob ornament, which is reflexed upwards, at first slightly
  (fig. 8), and then to a marked extent, turning back towards the bow.</p>

  <p>A far-reaching change in the design was at the same time brought about
  by a simple improvement in principle, apparently introduced within the
  area of the La Tène culture. Instead of a unilateral spring&mdash;that
  is, of one coiled on one side only of the bow as commonly in the modern
  safety-pin&mdash;the brooch became bilateral. The spring was coiled on
  one side of the axis of the bow, and thence the wire was taken to the
  other side of the axis, and again coiled in a corresponding manner before
  starting in a straight line to form the pin. Once invented, the bilateral
  spring became almost universal, and its introduction serves to divide the
  whole mass of ancient fibulae into an older and a younger group.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/brooch_4.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/brooch_4.png"

    <p class="poem"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.&mdash;Type III with
    disk for catch-plate, and convoluted bow.</p>
  </div>
  <p>With the progress of the La Tène period (300-1 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) the reflection of the catch-plate terminal
  became yet more marked, until it became practically merged in the bow
  (fig. 9). Meanwhile, the bilateral spring described above was developing
  into two marked projections on each side of the axis. In order to give
  the double spring strength and protection it was given a metal core, and
  a containing tube. When the core had been provided the pin was no longer
  necessarily a continuation of the bow, and it became in fact a separate
  member, as in a modern brooch of a non-safety-pin type, and was no longer
  actuated by its own spring.</p>

  <p>The T-shaped or "cross-bow" fibula was thus developed. During the
  first centuries of the Empire it attained great size and importance
  (figs. 10-12). The form is conveniently dated at its highest development
  by its occurrence on the ivory diptych of Stilicho at Monza (c. <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 400).</p>

  <p>In the tombs of the Frankish and kindred Teutonic tribes between the
  5th and 9th centuries the crossbar of the T becomes a yet more
  elaborately decorated semicircle, often surrounded by radial knobs and a
  chased surface. The base of the shaft is flattened out, and is no less
  ornate (fig. 13). At the beginning of this period the fibula of King
  Childeric (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 481) has a singularly
  complicated pin-fastening.</p>

  <p>So far we have traced the history of the safety-pin form of brooch.
  Concurrently with it, other forms of brooch were developed in which the
  safety-pin principle is either absent or effectually disguised. One such
  form is that of the circular medallion brooch. It is found in Etruscan
  deposits of a fully developed style, and is commonly represented in Greek
  and Roman sculptures as a stud to fasten the cloak on the shoulder. In
  the Roman provinces the circular brooches are very numerous, and are
  frequently decorated with inlaid stone, paste or enamel. Another kind of
  brooch, also known from early times, is in the form of an animal. In the
  early types the animal is a decorative appendage, but in later examples
  it forms the body of the brooch, to which a pin like the modern
  brooch-pin is attached underneath. Both of these shapes, namely the
  medallion and the animal form, are found in Frankish cemeteries, together
  with the later variations of the T-shaped brooch described above. Such
  brooches were made in gold, silver or bronze, adorned with precious
  stones, filigree work, or enamel; but whatever the richness of the
  material, the pin was nearly always of iron. The Scandinavian or northern
  group of T-shaped brooches are in their early forms indistinguishable
  from those of the Frankish tombs, but as time went on they became more
  massive, and richly decorated with intricate devices (perhaps brought in
  by Irish missionary influence), into which animal forms were introduced.
  The period covered is from the 5th to the 8th centuries.</p>

  <p>The T-form, the medallion-form, and (occasionally) the animal forms
  occur in Anglo-Saxon graves in England. In Kent the medallion-form
  predominates. The Anglo-Saxon brooches <!-- Page 643 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page643"></a>[v.04 p.0643]</span>were exquisite
  works of art, ingeniously and tastefully constructed. They are often of
  gold, with a central boss, exquisitely decorated, the flat part of the
  brooch being a mosaic of turquoises, garnets on gold foil, mother of
  pearl, &amp;c. arranged in geometric patterns, and the gold work enriched
  with filigree or decorated with dragonesque engravings.</p>

  <p>The Scandinavian brooches of the Viking period (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 800-1050) were oval and convex, somewhat in the
  form of a tortoise. In their earliest form they occur in the form of a
  frog-like animal, itself developed from the previous Teutonic T-shaped
  type. With the introduction of the intricate system of ornament described
  above, the frog-like animal is gradually superseded by purely decorative
  lines. The convex bowls are then worked <i>à jour</i> with a perforated
  upper shell of chased work over an under shell of impure bronze, gilt on
  the convex side. These outer cases are at last decorated with open
  crown-like ornament and massive projecting bosses. The geographical
  distribution of these peculiar brooches indicates the extent of the
  conquests of the Northmen. They occur in northern Scotland, England,
  Ireland, Iceland, Normandy and Livonia.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The Celtic group is characterized by the penannular form of the ring
  of the brooch and the greater length of the pin. The penannular ring,
  inserted through a hole at the head of the long pin, could be partially
  turned when the pin had been thrust through the material in such a way
  that the brooch became in effect a buckle. These brooches are usually of
  bronze or silver, chased or engraved with intricate designs of interlaced
  or dragonesque work in the style of the illuminated Celtic manuscripts of
  the 7th, 8th and 9th centuries. The Hunterston brooch, which was found at
  Hawking Craig in Ayrshire, is a well-known example of this style. Silver
  brooches of immense size, some having pins 15 in. in length, and the
  penannular ring of the brooch terminating in large knobs resembling
  thistle heads, are occasionally found in Viking hoards of this period,
  consisting of bullion, brooches and Cufic and Anglo-Saxon coins buried on
  Scottish soil. In medieval times the form of the brooch was usually a
  simple, flat circular disk, with open centre, the pin being equal in
  length to the diameter of the brooch. They were often inscribed with
  religious and talismanic <i>formulae</i>. The Highland brooches were
  commonly of this form, but the disk was broader, and the central opening
  smaller in proportion to the size of the brooch. They were ornamented in
  the style so common on Highland powder-horns, with engraved patterns of
  interlacing work and foliage, arranged in geometrical spaces, and
  sometimes mingled with figures of animals.</p>

  <p><b>BROOKE, FULKE GREVILLE,</b> <span class="scac">1ST BARON</span>
  (1554-1628), English poet, only son of Sir Fulke Greville, was born at
  Beauchamp Court, Warwickshire. He was sent in 1564, on the same day as
  his life-long friend, Philip Sidney, to Shrewsbury school. He
  matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1568. Sir Henry Sidney,
  president of Wales, gave him in 1576 a post connected with the court of
  the Marches, but he resigned it in 1577 to go to court with Philip
  Sidney. Young Greville became a great favourite with Queen Elizabeth, who
  treated him with less than her usual caprice, but he was more than once
  disgraced for leaving the country against her wishes. Philip Sidney, Sir
  Edward Dyer and Greville were members of the "Areopagus," the literary
  clique which, under the leadership of Gabriel Harvey, supported the
  introduction of classical metres into English verse. Sidney and Greville
  arranged to sail with Sir Francis Drake in 1585 in his expedition against
  the Spanish West Indies, but Elizabeth peremptorily forbade Drake to take
  them with him, and also refused Greville's request to be allowed to join
  Leicester's army in the Netherlands. Philip Sidney, who took part in the
  campaign, was killed on the 17th of October 1586, and Greville shared
  with Dyer the legacy of his books, while in his <i>Life of the Renowned
  Sir Philip Sidney</i> he raised an enduring monument to his friend's
  memory. About 1591 Greville served for a short time in Normandy under
  Henry of Navarre. This was his last experience of war. In 1583 he became
  secretary to the principality of Wales, and he represented Warwickshire
  in parliament in 1592-1593, 1597, 1601 and 1620. In 1598 he was made
  treasurer of the navy, and he retained the office through the early years
  of the reign of James I. In 1614 he became chancellor and under-treasurer
  of the exchequer, and throughout the reign he was a valued supporter of
  the king's party, although in 1615 he advocated the summoning of a
  parliament. In 1618 he became commissioner of the treasury, and in 1621
  he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Brooke, a title
  which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother, Elizabeth
  Willoughby. He received from James I. the grant of Warwick Castle, in the
  restoration of which he is said to have spent £20,000. He died on the
  30th of September 1628 in consequence of a wound inflicted by a servant
  who was disappointed at not being named in his master's will. Brooke was
  buried in St Mary's church, Warwick, and on his tomb was inscribed the
  epitaph he had composed for himself: "Folk Grevill Servant to Queene
  Elizabeth Conceller to King James Frend to Sir Philip Sidney. Trophaeum
  Peccati."</p>

  <p>A rhyming elegy on Brooke, published in Huth's <i>Inedited Poetical
  Miscellanies</i>, brings charges of extreme penuriousness against him,
  but of his generous treatment of contemporary writers there is abundant
  testimony. His only works published during his lifetime were four poems,
  one of which is the elegy on Sidney which appeared in <i>The Phoenix
  Nest</i> (1593), and the <i>Tragedy of Mustapha</i>. A volume of his
  works appeared in 1633, another of <i>Remains</i> in 1670, and his
  biography of Sidney in 1652. He wrote two tragedies on the Senecan model,
  <i>Alaham</i> and <i>Mustapha</i>. The scene of Alaham is laid in Ormuz.
  The development of the piece fully bears out the gloom of the prologue,
  in which the ghost of a former king of Ormuz reveals the magnitude of the
  curse about to descend on the doomed family. The theme of <i>Mustapha</i>
  is borrowed from Madeleine de Scudéry's <i>Ibrahim ou l'illustre
  Bassa</i>, and turns on the ambition of the sultana Rossa. The choruses
  of these plays are really philosophical dissertations, and the connexion
  with the rest of the drama is often very slight. In <i>Mustapha</i>, for
  instance, the third chorus is a dialogue between Time and Eternity, while
  the fifth consists of an invective against the evils of superstition,
  followed by a chorus of priests that does nothing to dispel <!-- Page 644
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page644"></a>[v.04 p.0644]</span>the
  impression of scepticism contained in the first part. He tells us himself
  that the tragedies were not intended for the stage. Charles Lamb says
  they should rather be called political treatises. Of Brooke Lamb says,
  "He is nine parts Machiavel and Tacitus, for one of Sophocles and
  Seneca.... Whether we look into his plays or his most passionate
  love-poems, we shall find all frozen and made rigid with intellect." He
  goes on to speak of the obscurity of expression that runs through all
  Brooke's poetry, an obscurity which is, however, due more to the
  intensity and subtlety of the thought than to any lack of mere verbal
  lucidity.</p>

  <p>It is by his biography of Sidney that Fulke Greville is best known.
  The full title expresses the scope of the work. It runs: <i>The Life of
  the Renowned Sr. Philip Sidney. With the true Interest of England as it
  then stood in relation to all Forrain Princes: And particularly for
  suppressing the power of Spain Stated by Him: His principall Actions,
  Counsels, Designes, and Death. Together with a short account of the
  Maximes and Policies used by Queen Elizabeth in her Government</i>. He
  includes some autobiographical matter in what amounts to a treatise on
  government. He had intended to write a history of England under the
  Tudors, but Robert Cecil refused him access to the necessary state
  papers.</p>

  <p>Brooke left no sons, and his barony passed to his cousin, Robert
  Greville (<i>c.</i> 1608-1643), who thus became 2nd Lord Brooke. This
  nobleman was imprisoned by Charles I. at York in 1639 for refusing to
  take the oath to fight for the king, and soon became an active member of
  the parliamentary party; taking part in the Civil War he defeated the
  Royalists in a skirmish at Kineton in August 1642. He was soon given a
  command in the midland counties, and having seized Lichfield he was
  killed there on the 2nd of March 1643. Brooke, who is eulogized as a
  friend of toleration by Milton, wrote on philosophical, theological and
  current political topics. In 1746 his descendant, Francis Greville, the
  8th baron (1710-1773), was created earl of Warwick, a title still in his
  family.</p>

  <p>Dr A.B. Grosart edited the complete works of Fulke Greville for the
  <i>Fuller Worthies Library</i> in 1870, and made a small selection,
  published in the <i>Elizabethan Library</i> (1894). Besides the works
  above mentioned, the volumes include <i>Poems of Monarchy, A Treatise of
  Religion, A Treatie of Humane Learning, An Inquisition upon Fame and
  Honour, A Treatie of Warres, Caelica in CX Sonnets</i>, a collection of
  lyrics in various forms, a letter to an "Honourable Lady," a letter to
  Grevill Varney in France, and a short speech delivered on behalf of
  Francis Bacon, some minor poems, and an introduction including some of
  the author's letters. The life of Sidney was reprinted by Sir S. Egerton
  Brydges in 1816; and with an introduction by N. Smith in the "Tudor and
  Stuart Library" in 1907; <i>Caelica</i> was reprinted in M.F. Crow's
  "Elizabethan Sonnet Cycles" in 1898. See also an essay in Mrs. C.C.
  Stopes's <i>Shakespeare's Warwickshire Contemporaries</i> (1907).</p>

  <p><b>BROOKE, HENRY</b> (<i>c.</i> 1703-1783), Irish author, son of
  William Brooke, rector of Killinkere, Co. Cavan, was born at Rantavan in
  the same county, about 1703. His mother was a daughter of Simon Digby,
  bishop of Elphin. Dr Thomas Sheridan was one of his schoolmasters, and he
  was entered at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1720; in 1724 he was sent to
  London to study law. He married his cousin and ward, Catherine Meares,
  before she was fourteen. Returning to London he published a philosophical
  poem in six books entitled <i>Universal Beauty</i> (1735). He attached
  himself to the party of the prince of Wales, and took a small house at
  Twickenham near to Alexander Pope. In 1738 he translated the first and
  second books of Tasso's <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i>, and in the next year
  he produced a tragedy, <i>Gustavas Vasa, the Deliverer of his
  Country</i>. This play had been rehearsed for five weeks at Drury Lane,
  but at the last moment the performance was forbidden. The reason of this
  prohibition was a supposed portrait of Sir Robert Walpole in the part of
  Trollio. In any case the spirit of fervent patriotism which pervaded the
  play was probably disliked by the government. The piece was printed and
  sold largely, being afterwards put on the Irish stage under the title of
  <i>The Patriot</i>. This affair provoked a satirical pamphlet from Samuel
  Johnson, entitled "A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage
  from the malicious and scandalous Aspersions of Mr Brooke" (1739). His
  wife feared that his connexion with the opposition was imprudent, and
  induced him to return to Ireland. He interested himself in Irish history
  and literature, but a projected collection of Irish stories and a history
  of Ireland from the earliest times were abandoned in consequence of
  disputes about the ownership of the materials. During the Jacobite
  rebellion of 1745 Brooke issued his <i>Farmer's Six Letters to the
  Protestants of Ireland</i> (collected 1746) the form of which was
  suggested by Swift's <i>Drapier's Letters</i>. For this service he
  received from the government the post of barrack-master at Mullingar,
  which he held till his death. He wrote other pamphlets on the Protestant
  side, and was secretary to an association for promoting projects of
  national utility. About 1760 he entered into negotiations with leading
  Roman Catholics, and in 1761 he wrote a pamphlet advocating alleviation
  of the penal laws against them. He is said to have been the first editor
  of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, established at Dublin in 1763. Meanwhile
  he had been obliged to mortgage his property in Cavan, and had removed to
  Co. Kildare. Subsequently a bequest from Colonel Robert Brooke enabled
  him to purchase an estate near his old home, and he spent large sums in
  attempting to reclaim the waste-land. His best-known work is the novel
  entitled <i>The Fool of Quality; or the History of Henry Earl of
  Moreland</i>, the first part of which was published in 1765; and the
  fifth and last in 1770. The characters of this book, which relates the
  education of an ideal nobleman by an ideal merchant-prince, are gifted
  with a "passionate and tearful sensibility," and reflect the real humour
  and tenderness of the writer. Brooke's religious and philanthropic temper
  recommended the book to John Wesley, who edited (1780) an abridged
  edition, and to Charles Kingsley, who published it with a eulogistic
  notice in 1859. Brooke had a large family, but only two children survived
  him. His wife's death seriously affected him, and he died at Dublin in a
  state of mental infirmity on the 10th of October 1783.</p>

  <p>His daughter, Charlotte Brooke, published <i>The Poetical Works of
  Henry Brooke</i> in 1792, but was able to supply very little biographical
  material. Other sources for Brooke's biography are C. H. Wilson,
  <i>Brookiana</i> (2 vols., 1804), and a biographical preface by E. A.
  Baker prefixed to a new edition (1906) of <i>The Fool of Quality</i>.
  Brooke's other works include several tragedies, only some of which were
  actually staged. He also wrote: <i>Jack the Giant Queller</i> (1748), an
  operatic satire, the repetition of which was forbidden on account of its
  political allusions; "Constantia, or the Man of Lawe's Tale" (1741),
  contributed to George Ogle's <i>Canterbury Tales modernized; Juliet
  Grenville; or the History of the Human Heart</i> (1773), a novel; and
  some fables contributed to Edward Moore's <i>Fables for the Female
  Sex</i> (1744).</p>

  <p><b>BROOKE, SIR JAMES</b> (1803-1868), English soldier, traveller and
  raja of Sarawak, was born at Coombe Grove near Bath, on the 29th of April
  1803. His father, a member of the civil service of the East India
  Company, had long lived in Bengal. His mother was a woman of superior
  mind, and to her care he owed his careful early training. He received the
  ordinary school education, entered the service of the East India Company,
  and was sent out to India about 1825. On the outbreak of the Burmese War
  he was despatched with his regiment to the valley of the Brahmaputra;
  and, being dangerously wounded in an engagement near Rungpore, was
  compelled to return home (1826). After his recovery he travelled on the
  continent before going to India, and circumstances led him soon after to
  leave the service of the company. In 1830 he made a voyage to China, and
  during his passage among the islands of the Indian Archipelago, so rich
  in natural beauty, magnificence and fertility, but occupied by a
  population of savage tribes, continually at war with each other, and
  carrying on a system of piracy on a vast scale and with relentless
  ferocity, he conceived the great design of rescuing them from barbarism
  and bringing them within the pale of civilization. His purpose was
  confirmed by observations made during a second visit to China, and on his
  return to England he applied himself in earnest to making the necessary
  preparations. Having succeeded on the death of his father to a large
  property, he bought and equipped a yacht, the "Royalist," of 140 tons
  burden, and for three years tested its capacities and trained his crew of
  <!-- Page 645 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page645"></a>[v.04
  p.0645]</span>twenty men, chiefly in the Mediterranean. At length, on the
  27th of October 1838, he sailed from the Thames on his great adventure.
  On reaching Borneo, after various delays, he found the raja Muda Hassim,
  uncle of the reigning sultan, engaged in war in the province of Sarawak
  with several of the Dyak tribes, who had revolted against the sultan. He
  offered his aid to the raja; and with his crew, and some Javanese who had
  joined them, he took part in a battle with the insurgents, and they were
  defeated. For his services the title of raja of Sarawak was conferred on
  him by Muda Hassim, the former raja being deprived in his favour. It was,
  however, some time before the sultan could be induced to confirm his
  title (September 1841). During the next five years Raja Brooke was
  engaged in establishing his power, in making just reforms in
  administration, preparing a code of laws and introducing just and humane
  modes of dealing with the degraded subjects of his rule. But this was not
  all. He looked forward to the development of commerce as the most
  effective means of putting an end to the worst evils that afflicted the
  archipelago; and in order to make this possible, the way must first be
  cleared by the suppression, or a considerable diminution, of the
  prevailing piracy, which was not only a curse to the savage tribes
  engaged in it, but a standing danger to European and American traders in
  those seas. Various expeditions were therefore organized and sent out
  against the marauders, Dyaks and Malays, and sometimes even Arabs.
  Captain (afterwards Admiral Sir Harry) Keppel, and other commanders of
  British ships of war, received permission to co-operate with Raja Brooke
  in these expeditions. The pirates were attacked in their strongholds,
  they fought desperately, and the slaughter was immense. Negotiations with
  the chiefs had been tried, and tried in vain. The capital of the sultan
  of Borneo was bombarded and stormed, and the sultan with his army routed.
  He was, however, soon after restored to his dominion. So large was the
  number of natives, pirates and others, slain in these expeditions, that
  the "head-money" awarded by the British government to those who had taken
  part in them amounted to no less than £20,000. In October 1847 Raja
  Brooke returned to England, where he was well received by the government;
  and the corporation of London conferred on him the freedom of the city.
  The island of Labuan, with its dependencies, having been acquired by
  purchase from the sultan of Borneo, was erected into a British colony,
  and Raja Brooke was appointed governor and commander-in-chief. He was
  also named consul-general in Borneo. These appointments had been made
  before his arrival in England. The university of Oxford conferred on him
  the honorary degree of D.C.L., and in 1848 he was created K.C.B. He soon
  after returned to Sarawak, and was carried thither by a British
  man-of-war. In the summer of 1849 he led an expedition against the
  Seribas and Sakuran Dyaks, who still persisted in their piratical
  practices and refused to submit to British authority. Their defeat and
  wholesale slaughter was a matter of course. At the time of this
  engagement Sir James Brooke was lying ill with dysentery. He visited
  twice the capital of the sultan of Sala, and concluded a treaty with him,
  which had for one of its objects the expulsion of the sea-gypsies and
  other tribes from his dominions. In 1851 grave charges with respect to
  the operations in Borneo were brought against Sir James Brooke in the
  House of Commons by Joseph Hume and other members, especially as to the
  "head-money" received. To meet these accusations, and to vindicate his
  proceedings, he came to England. The evidence adduced was so conflicting
  that the matter was at length referred to a royal commission, to sit at
  Singapore. As the result of its investigation the charges were declared
  to be "not proven." Sir James, however, was soon after deprived of the
  governorship of Labuan, and the head-money was abolished. In 1867 his
  house in Sarawak was attacked and burnt by Chinese pirates, and he had to
  fly from the capital, Kuching. With a small force he attacked the
  Chinese, recovered the town, made a great slaughter of them, and drove
  away the rest. In the following year he came to England, and remained
  there for three years. During this time he was attacked by paralysis, a
  public subscription was raised, and an estate in Devonshire was bought
  and presented to him. He made two more visits to Sarawak, and on each
  occasion had a rebellion to suppress. He spent his last days on his
  estate at Burrator in Devonshire, and died there, on the 11th of June
  1868, being succeeded as raja of Sarawak by his nephew. Sir James Brooke
  was a man of the highest personal character, and he displayed rare
  courage both in his conflicts in the East and under the charges advanced
  against him in England.</p>

  <p>His <i>Private Letters</i> (1838 to 1853) were published in 1853.
  Portions of his <i>Journal</i> were edited by Captains Munday and Keppel.

  <p><b>BROOKE, STOPFORD AUGUSTUS</b> (1832- ), English divine and man of
  letters, born at Letterkenny, Donegal, Ireland, in 1832, was educated at
  Trinity College, Dublin. He was ordained in the Church of England in
  1857, and held various charges in London. From 1863 to 1865 he was
  chaplain to the empress Frederick in Berlin, and in 1872 he became
  chaplain in ordinary to Queen Victoria. But in 1880 he seceded from the
  Church, being no longer able to accept its leading dogmas, and officiated
  as a Unitarian minister for some years at Bedford chapel, Bloomsbury.
  Bedford chapel was pulled down about 1894, and from that time he had no
  church of his own, but his eloquence and powerful religious personality
  continued to make themselves felt among a wide circle. A man of
  independent means, he was always keenly interested in literature and art,
  and a fine critic of both. He published in 1865 his <i>Life and Letters
  of F. W. Robertson</i> (of Brighton), and in 1876 wrote an admirable
  primer of <i>English Literature</i> (new and revised ed., 1900), followed
  in 1892 by <i>The History of Early English Literature</i> (2 vols., 1892)
  down to the accession of Alfred, and <i>English Literature from the
  Beginnings to the Norman Conquest</i> (1898). His other works include
  various volumes of sermons; <i>Poems</i> (1888); <i>Dove Cottage</i>
  (1890); <i>Theology in the English Poets&mdash;Cowper, Coleridge,
  Wordsworth, Burns</i> (1874); <i>Tennyson, his Art and Relation to Modern
  Life</i> (1894); <i>The Poetry of Robert Browning</i> (1902); <i>On Ten
  Plays of Shakespeare</i> (1905); and <i>The Life Superlative</i>
  (1906).</p>

  <p><b>BROOK FARM,</b> the name applied to a tract of land in West
  Roxbury, Massachusetts, on which in 1841-1847 a communistic experiment
  was unsuccessfully tried. The experiment was one of the practical
  manifestations of the spirit of "Transcendentalism," in New England,
  though many of the more prominent transcendentalists took no direct part
  in it. The project was originated by George Ripley, who also virtually
  directed it throughout. In his words it was intended "to insure a more
  natural union between intellectual and manual labour than now exists; to
  combine the thinker and the worker, as far as possible, in the same
  individual; to guarantee the highest mental freedom by providing all with
  labour adapted to their tastes and talents, and securing to them the
  fruits of their industry; to do away with the necessity of menial
  services by opening the benefits of education and the profits of labour
  to all; and thus to prepare a society of liberal, intelligent and
  cultivated persons whose relations with each other would permit a more
  simple and wholesome life than can be led amidst the pressure of our
  competitive institutions." In short, its aim was to bring about the best
  conditions for an ideal civilization, reducing to a minimum the labour
  necessary for mere existence, and by this and by the simplicity of its
  social machinery saving the maximum of time for mental and spiritual
  education and development. At a time when Ralph Waldo Emerson could write
  to Thomas Carlyle, "We are all a little wild here with numberless
  projects of social reform; not a reading man but has a draft of a new
  community in his waistcoat pocket,"&mdash;the Brook Farm project
  certainly did not appear as impossible a scheme as many others that were
  in the air. At all events it enlisted the co-operation of men whose
  subsequent careers show them to have been something more than
  visionaries. The association bought a tract of land about 10 m. from
  Boston, and in the summer of 1841 began its enterprise with about twenty
  members. In September the "Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and
  Education" was formally organized, the members <!-- Page 646 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page646"></a>[v.04 p.0646]</span>signing the
  Articles of Association and forming an unincorporated joint-stock
  company. The farm was assiduously, if not very skilfully, cultivated, and
  other industries were established&mdash;most of the members paying by
  labour for their board&mdash;but nearly all of the income, and sometimes
  all of it, was derived from the school, which deservedly took high rank
  and attracted many pupils. Among these were included George William
  Curtis and his brother James Burrill Curtis, Father Isaac Thomas Hecker
  (1819-1888), General Francis C. Barlow (1834-1896), who as
  attorney-general of New York in 1871-1873 took a leading part in the
  prosecution of the "Tweed Ring." For three years the undertaking went on
  quietly and simply, subject to few outward troubles other than financial,
  the number of associates increasing to seventy or eighty. It was during
  this period that Nathaniel Hawthorne had his short experience of Brook
  Farm, of which so many suggestions appear in the <i>Blithedale
  Romance</i>, though his preface to later editions effectually disposed of
  the idea&mdash;which gave him great pain&mdash;that he had either drawn
  his characters from persons there, or had meant to give any actual
  description of the colony. Emerson refused, in a kind and characteristic
  letter, to join the undertaking, and though he afterwards wrote of Brook
  Farm with not uncharitable humour as "a perpetual picnic, a French
  Revolution in small, an age of reason in a patty-pan," among its founders
  were many of his near friends. In 1844 the growing need of a more
  scientific organization, and the influence which F.M.C. Fourier's
  doctrines, as modified by Albert Brisbane (1809-1890), had gained in the
  minds of Ripley and many of his associates, combined to change the whole
  plan of the community. It was transformed, with the strong approval of
  all its chief members and the consent of the rest, into a Fourierist
  "phalanx" in 1845. There was an accession of new members, a momentary
  increase of prosperity, a brilliant new undertaking in the publication of
  a weekly journal, the <i>Harbinger</i>, in which Ripley, Charles A. Dana,
  Francis G. Shaw and John S. Dwight were the chief writers, and to which
  James Russell Lowell, J.G. Whittier, George William Curtis, Parke Godwin,
  T.W. Higginson, Horace Greeley and many more now and then contributed.
  But the individuality of the old Brook Farm was gone. The association was
  not rescued even from financial troubles by the change. With increasing
  difficulty it kept on till the spring of 1846, when a fire which
  destroyed its nearly completed "phalanstery" brought losses which caused,
  or certainly gave the final ostensible reason for, its dissolution. The
  experiment was abandoned in the autumn of 1847. Besides Ripley and
  Hawthorne, the principal members of the community were Charles A. Dana,
  John S. Dwight, Minot Pratt (<i>c.</i> 1805-1878), the head farmer, who,
  like George Partridge Bradford (1808-1890), left in 1845, and Warren
  Burton (1810-1866) a preacher and, later, a writer on educational
  subjects. Indirectly connected with the experiment, also, as visitors for
  longer or shorter periods but never as regular members, were Emerson,
  Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes A. Brownson, Theodore Parker and William
  Henry Channing, Margaret Fuller and Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. The estate
  itself, after passing through various hands, came in 1870 into the
  possession of the "Association of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for
  Works of Mercy," which established here an orphanage, known as the
  "Martin Luther Orphan Home."</p>

  <p>The best account of Brook Farm is Lindsay Swift's <i>Brook Farm, Its
  Members, Scholars and Visitors</i> (New York, 1900). <i>Brook Farm:
  Historic and Personal Memoirs</i> (Boston, 1894), is by Dr J.T. Codman,
  one of the pupils in the school. See also Morris Hillquit's <i>History of
  Socialism in the United States</i> (New York, 1903).</p>

  <p><b>BROOKITE,</b> one of the three modifications in which titanium
  dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) occurs in nature; the other minerals with the
  same chemical composition, but with different physical and
  crystallographic characters, being rutile (<i>q.v.</i>) and anatase
  (<i>q.v.</i>) The two latter are tetragonal in crystallization, whilst
  brookite is orthorhombic. The name was given by A. Lévy in 1825 in honour
  of the English mineralogist H.J. Brooke (1771-1857). Two types of
  brookite crystals may be distinguished. The commoner type of crystals are
  thin and tabular, and often terminated by numerous small and brilliant
  faces (fig. 1); the faces of the orthopinacoid (<i>a</i>) and of the
  prisms (<i>m</i>, <i>l</i>) are vertically striated. These crystals are
  of a rich reddish-brown colour and are often translucent. Crystals of the
  second type have the appearance of six-sided bipyramids (fig. 2) owing to
  the equal development of the prism <i>m</i> {110} and the pyramid
  <i>e</i> {122}; these crystals are black and opaque, and constitute the
  variety known as arkansite.</p>

  <p>The lustre of brookite is metallic-adamantine. There is no distinct
  cleavage (rutile and anatase have cleavages); hardness 5½-6; sp. gr. 4.0.
  The optical characters are interesting: the optic axes for red and for
  blue light lie in planes at right angles to each other, whilst for
  yellow-green light the crystals are uniaxial. The acute bisectrix of the
  optic axes is perpendicular to the orthopinacoid (<i>a</i>) for all
  colours, so that this phenomenon of the crossing of the optic axial
  planes may be readily observed in the thin tabular crystals of the
  first-mentioned type.</p>

  <p>Brookite occurs only as crystals, never in compact masses, and is
  usually associated with either anatase or rutile. The crystals are found
  attached to the walls of cavities in decomposed igneous rocks and
  crystalline schists; it is also found as minute isolated crystals in many
  sedimentary rocks. The best-known locality is Fronolen near Tremadoc in
  North Wales, where crystals of the thin tabular habit occur with
  crystallized quartz, albite and anatase on the walls of crevices in
  diabase. Similar crystals of relatively large size are found attached to
  gneiss at several places in the Swiss and Tirolese Alps. Thicker crystals
  of prismatic, rather than tabular, habit and of a rich red colour
  combined with considerable transparency and brilliancy are found in the
  gold-washings of the Sanarka river in the southern Urals. The arkansite
  variety occurs with rutile in the elaeolite-syenite of Magnet Cove in Hot
  Spring county, Arkansas. Minute crystals of brookite have been detected
  with anatase and rutile in the iron-ore of Cleveland in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>Crystals of brookite, as well as of anatase and rutile, have been
  prepared artificially by the interaction of steam and titanium fluoride,
  the particular modification of titanium dioxide which results depending
  on the temperature at which the reaction takes place. Brookite is liable
  to become altered to rutile: aggregates of rutile needles with the form
  of brookite (arkansite) are not uncommon at Magnet Cove, Arkansas.</p>

  <p><b>BROOKLIME</b>, known botanically as <i>Veronica Beccabunga</i>
  (natural order Scrophulariaceae), a succulent herb growing on margins of
  brooks and ditches in the British Isles, and a native of Europe, north
  Africa and north and western Asia. It has smooth spreading branches,
  blunt oblong leaves and small bright blue or pink flowers.</p>

  <p><b>BROOKLINE</b>, a township of Norfolk county, Massachusetts, U.S.A.,
  about 3 m. S.W. of Boston, lying immediately S. of the Back Bay district.
  Pop. (1890) 12,103; (1900) 19,935, of whom 6536 were foreign-born; (1910,
  census) 27,792. The area of the township in 1906 was 6.75 sq. m. It is
  served by the Boston &amp; Albany railway, and is connected with Boston
  by an electric line. Brookline is the wealthiest of the residential
  suburbs of Boston; and contains a number of beautiful estates and homes.
  Within its limits are the villages of Cottage Farm, Longwood, and
  Reservoir Station, or Chestnut Hill&mdash;the Chestnut Hill reservoir is
  just beyond the township. Brookline has an excellent public library. At
  Clyde Park are the grounds and club-house of the Boston Country Club.
  Brookline has long been regarded as a model city suburb. It is connected
  with <!-- Page 647 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page647"></a>[v.04
  p.0647]</span>Boston Common by boulevards of the Metropolitan Park
  System. The first settlement was probably made about 1635, and it was
  called Muddy River until 1705, when it was created a township under the
  name of Brookline. Up to 1793 it belonged to Suffolk county, of which
  Boston is a part, and since that time it has belonged to Norfolk county;
  but Boston has in its growth almost surrounded it, and because of its
  great wealth there has been a long struggle for and against its merger in
  Boston. Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape gardener, had his
  home in Brookline, where there are various examples of his work.</p>

  1630-1906</i>(Allston, Mass., 1907).</p>

  <p><b>BROOKLYN,</b> formerly a city of New York state, U.S.A., but since
  1898 a borough of New York City (<i>q.v.</i>), situated at the S.W.
  extremity of Long Island. It is conterminous with Kings county, and is
  bounded N. by the borough of Queens, from which it is in part separated
  by Newtown Creek; E. by the borough of Queens and Jamaica Bay; S. by the
  Atlantic Ocean; W. by Gravesend Bay, the Narrows, Upper New York Bay and
  East river, which separate it from Staten Island, Jersey City and the
  borough of Manhattan. It has a water-front of 33 m. and extends over an
  area of 77.62 sq. m. Pop. (1860) 279,122; (1870) 419,921; (1880) 599,495;
  (1890, then Kings county) 838,547; (1900) 1,166,582; (1905, state census)
  1,358,686; (1910) 1,634.351. In 1900 only 310,501, or 26.6%, were
  native-born of native white parents; 355,697 were foreign-born, 18,367
  were negroes, and 1206 were Chinese. Out of 332,715 males of voting age
  (21 years and over), 15,415 were illiterate (unable to write), and of
  these 14,159 were foreign-born.</p>

  <p>Brooklyn is connected with Manhattan by three bridges across the East
  river&mdash;the lowest, known as the Brooklyn, opened in 1883; another,
  known as the Williamsburg or East River bridge, opened in 1903; and a
  third, the Manhattan, was opened in 1909. And a tunnel directly across
  from the south terminus of Manhattan was completed in 1907. Ferries ply
  at frequent intervals between numerous points on its west water-front and
  points in Manhattan; there is also ferry connexion with Jersey City.
  Brooklyn is served directly by the Long Island railway; by about fifty
  regular coast-wise and trans-Atlantic steamship lines; and by elevated or
  surface car lines on a large number of its streets. Subway lines, begun
  in 1904, connect Brooklyn with the subway system of Manhattan.</p>

  <p><i>Streets and Buildings.</i>&mdash;The surface of Brooklyn in the
  west section, from the lower course of the East river to Gravesend Bay,
  varies in elevation from a few inches to nearly 200 ft. above sea-level,
  the highest points being in Prospect Park; but steep street grades even
  in this section are rare, and elsewhere the surface is either only
  slightly undulating or, as in the east and south, flat. Most of the
  streets are from 60 to 100 ft. wide. The principal business thoroughfare
  is Fulton Street, which begins at Fulton ferry nearly under the Brooklyn
  bridge, runs to City Hall Park, and thence across the north central
  section of the borough. In the City Hall Park are the old city hall (now
  the borough hall), the hall of records, and the county court-house. Two
  blocks to the north (on Washington Street) is the post-office, a fine
  granite Romanesque building. The manufacturing and shipping districts are
  mostly along the west water-front. Here, on Wallabout Bay at the bend of
  the East river to the westward, is the New York navy yard, the principal
  navy yard of the United States, established in 1801, and commonly but
  incorrectly called the Brooklyn navy yard. It occupies altogether about
  144 acres, contains a trophy park, parade grounds, the United States
  Naval Lyceum (founded 1833), officers' quarters, barracks, and three
  large dry docks (respectively 564, 465 and 307 ft. long), foundries and
  machine shops. A naval hospital (having accommodation for about 500
  patients) to the east is separated from the navy yard by the largest and
  most interesting of Brooklyn's markets, the Wallabout (about 45 acres).
  The buildings of this market are Dutch in style and have a quaint clock
  tower. A little to the north of the navy yard are immense refineries of
  sugar. About 2 m. to the south, opposite Governor's Island, is the
  Atlantic Basin of 40 acres, with a wharfage of about 3 m. and brick and
  granite warehouses used largely for the storage of grain. A little
  farther south, on Gowanus Bay, is another basin, the Erie, of 161 acres,
  protected by a breakwater 1 m. in length, occupied by piers, warehouses,
  lumber depots and some of the largest dry docks in the United States; it
  also provides protection during winter to hundreds of canal boats. In
  this vicinity, too, are several yards for building yachts, launches and
  other boats. At the lower end of the west water-front, facing the
  Narrows, are a United States reservation and the harbour defences of Fort
  Hamilton.</p>

  <p>For a considerable portion of its inhabitants Brooklyn is only a place
  of residence, their business interests being in the borough of Manhattan;
  hence Brooklyn has been called the "city of homes" and the "dormitory of
  New York." Residential districts with social lines more or less
  distinctly drawn are numerous. The oldest is that on Brooklyn (or
  Columbia) Heights, west of City Hall Park, rising abruptly from the river
  to a height of from 70 to 100 ft., and commanding a delightful view of
  the harbour. Here are hotels, large apartment-houses, many private
  residences and a number of clubs, including the Brooklyn, the Crescent,
  the Hamilton, the Jefferson and the Germania. On Park Slope, immediately
  west of Prospect Park, and St Mark's Avenue, in another part of the
  borough, are also attractive residential districts. The south shore of
  the borough has various summer pleasure resorts, of which Coney Island is
  the most popular.</p>

  <p><i>Parks and Cemeteries.</i>&mdash;One of the most attractive features
  of Brooklyn is Prospect Park, occupying about 516 acres of high ground in
  the west central part of the borough, on a site made memorable by the
  battle of Long Island. Its large variety of trees and shrubs, including
  oak, hickory, elm, maple, chestnut, birch, ash, cedar, pine, larch and
  sumach, its flower gardens, a palm house, ponds, a lake of 61 acres for
  boating, skating and curling, a parade ground of 40 acres for other
  athletic sports, a menagerie, and numerous pieces of statuary, are among
  its objects of interest or beauty. From the southern entrance to this
  park, Ocean Parkway, a fine boulevard, 210 ft. wide and planted with six
  rows of trees, extends 5½ m. south to Seaside Park (15 acres), on
  Brighton Beach, Coney Island. From the same entrance Fort Hamilton
  Parkway extends 4½ m. south-east to Fort Hamilton, and to Dyker Beach
  Park (144 acres) which face the lower end of the Narrows; and from Fort
  Hamilton, Shore Road and Bay Ridge Parkway extend north 4½ m. to Bay
  Ridge Park overlooking Upper New York Bay. From the northern entrance to
  Prospect Park, Eastern Parkway, another fine boulevard, 200 ft. wide,
  extends east 2½ m. to a point from which Rockaway Parkway runs 3 m.
  south-east to Canarsie Beach Park (40 acres), on Jamaica Bay; and
  extensions of Eastern Parkway run north-east through Highland Park (55
  acres), to Brooklyn Forest Park (535 acres, on the border of the borough
  of Queens), abounding in beautiful trees and delightful views. Half a
  mile east of the borough hall is Washington or Fort Greene Park (30
  acres), laid out on the site of earthworks (known as Fort Greene)
  constructed during the War of Independence, and commanding good
  views.</p>

  <p>Greenwood cemetery, one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the United
  States, ½ m. east of Prospect Park, occupies about 478 acres. Among the
  principal monuments are those erected to Roger Williams, S.F.B. Morse,
  Elias Howe, De Witt Clinton (colossal bronze statue by Henry Kirke
  Brown), Henry Ward Beecher, Peter Cooper, Horace Greeley, Henry Bergh,
  Henry George and James Gordon Bennett. At the main entrance is a
  beautiful gateway (of elaborately wrought brown stone), 142 ft. wide and
  having a central tower 100 ft. in height. Along the north-east border of
  the borough are Cypress Hills cemetery (400 acres), adjoining Brooklyn
  Forest Park, and the cemetery of the Evergreens (about 375 acres),
  adjoining Highland Park and partly in the borough of Queens.</p>

<p><!-- Page 648 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page648"></a>[v.04 p.0648]</span></p>

  <p>In the plaza at the northern entrance to Prospect Park is a soldiers'
  and sailors' memorial arch (80 ft. in width and 71 ft. in height),
  adorned with high-reliefs of Lincoln and Grant on horseback (by O'Donovan
  and Eakins) and with three large bronze groups (by Frederick MacMonnies).
  Immediately within the park there is a statue (also by MacMonnies) of
  J.S.T. Stranahan (1808-1898), who did more than any other man for the
  development of Brooklyn's system of parks and boulevards. On the slope of
  Lookout Hill (185 ft.) within the park is a shaft erected in 1895 to the
  memory of the Maryland soldiers who valiantly defended the rear of the
  American army at the battle of Long Island. A bronze statue of Abraham
  Lincoln overlooks the lake. In Fort Greene Park is a monument to the
  memory of the soldiers who died in the British prison ships during the
  War of Independence, many of them having been buried in a vault below.
  Facing the borough hall is a statue in bronze (by J.Q.A. Ward) of Henry
  Ward Beecher, mounted on a granite pedestal with a figure at one side to
  commemorate Beecher's sympathy for the slave. A fine bronze statue of
  Alexander Hamilton (by W.O. Partridge, b. 1861) stands at the entrance of
  the Hamilton Club in Clinton Street and one of U.S. Grant (also by
  Partridge) stands at the entrance of the Union League Club in Bedford
  Avenue.</p>

  <p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences
  embraces twenty-six departments, of which those of music, philology and
  the fine arts have each more than 1000 members; the total membership of
  all departments in 1906 was 5894. The museum building of this institution
  is in Institute Park, which is separated from Prospect Park on the
  north-east by Flatbush Avenue. It contains, besides paintings and
  statuary, special collections for service in nearly all of the
  departments; among its purely art collections the most notable is that of
  J.J.J. Tissot's water-colour drawings, to illustrate the life of Christ.
  Since 1890 the Institute has received appropriations from the city, but
  it is maintained chiefly by private contributions. It is the outgrowth of
  the Apprentices' Library Association, founded in 1824, of which General
  Lafayette laid the corner-stone on the 4th of July of that year. In 1888
  Franklin W. Hooper (b. 1851), who did much to increase the efficiency of
  the work of the Institute, became director. Pratt Institute, founded in
  1887 by Charles Pratt (1830-1891), and the residuary legatee of his wife,
  who died in 1907, is one of the most successful manual and industrial
  training schools in the country, and its kindergarten normal is one of
  the best known in the United States. The Polytechnic Institute, opened in
  1855, is a high-grade school of science and liberal arts. It has two
  general departments, the college of arts and engineering and the
  preparatory school, which are conducted independently of one another. In
  connexion with the college there is provision for graduate study and for
  night courses, and there are teachers' courses to which women are
  admitted. The Packer Collegiate Institute, opened as the successor of the
  Brooklyn Female Academy, in 1854, and endowed by Mrs Harriet L. Packer,
  an institution for women, has primary, preparatory, academic and
  collegiate departments. Adelphi College, opened in 1896, is for both
  sexes and gives special attention to normal training; it is the outgrowth
  of Adelphi Academy, founded in 1869, now the preparatory department. St
  Francis' College, opened in 1858, and St John's College, opened in 1870,
  are institutions maintained by Roman Catholics. Here, too, are the law
  school of St Lawrence University, the Long Island Hospital Medical
  College, with a training school for nurses, the Brooklyn College of
  Pharmacy and several schools of music. Brooklyn's public schools rank
  especially high; among them there is a commercial high school and a
  manual training high school. Among the larger libraries of the borough
  are the Brooklyn public library, those of the Long Island Historical
  Society, on Brooklyn Heights, of Pratt Institute, and of the King's
  County Medical Society, and a good law library. The <i>Brooklyn Daily
  Eagle</i>, which occupies an attractive building near the borough hall,
  has been a newspaper of strong influence in the community. It was
  established in 1841 as a Democratic organ, and Walt Whitman was its
  editor for about a year during its early history.</p>

  <p>Brooklyn is well provided with charitable institutions, and has long
  been known as the "city of churches," probably from the famous clergymen
  who have lived there. Among them were Henry Ward Beecher, pastor of
  Plymouth church (Congregational) from 1847 to 1887; Lyman Abbott, pastor
  of the same church from 1887 to 1898; Thomas De Witt Talmage, pastor of
  the Brooklyn Tabernacle (Presbyterian) from 1869 to 1894; Richard Salter
  Storrs (1821-1900), pastor of the church of the Pilgrims (Congregational)
  from 1846 to 1899; and Theodore L. Cuyler (1822-1909), pastor of the
  Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian church from 1860 to 1890.</p>

  <p><i>Manufactures and Commerce.</i>&mdash;The borough of Brooklyn is one
  of the most important manufacturing centres in the United States, most of
  the factories being located along or near the East river north of the
  Brooklyn bridge. The total value of the manufactured products in 1890 was
  $270,823,754 and in 1900, $342,127,124, an increase during the decade of
  26.3%. In 1905 the total value of the borough's manufactured product
  (under the factory system) was $373,462,930, or 15% of the total
  manufactured product of the state of New York. Brooklyn's largest
  manufacturing industry is the refining of sugar, about one-half of the
  sugar consumed in the United States being refined here; in 1900 the
  product of the sugar and molasses refining establishments was valued at
  $77,942,997. Brooklyn is also an important place for the milling of
  coffee and spices (the 1905 product was valued at $15,274,092), the
  building of small boats, and the manufacture of foundry and machine shop
  products, malt liquors, barrels, shoes, chemicals, paints, cordage,
  twine, and hosiery and other knitted goods. Of its large commerce, grain
  is the chief commodity; it is estimated that about four-fifths of that
  exported from the port of New York is shipped from here, and the
  borough's grain elevators have an estimated storage capacity of about
  20,000,000 bushels.</p>

  <p>The water-supply system is owned and operated by the borough; the
  water is derived from streams flowing southward in the sparsely settled
  area east of the borough, and also from driven wells in the same region;
  it is pumped by ten engines at Ridgewood to a reservoir having a capacity
  of about 300,000,000 gallons, while a part of it is re-pumped to a high
  service reservoir near the north entrance to Prospect Park for the
  service of the most elevated part of the borough. Besides this system
  some towns in the south section recently annexed have their own
  water-supply.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The first settlement within the present limits
  of Brooklyn was made in 1636, when some Dutch farmers took up their
  residence along the shore of Gowanus Bay. About the same time other Dutch
  farmers founded Flatlands (at first called Amersfoort), on Jamaica Bay,
  and a few Walloons founded Wallabout, where the navy yard now is. In 1642
  a ferry was established across East river from the present foot of Fulton
  Street, and a settlement grew up here which was known as The Ferry. The
  next year Lady Deborah Moody with some followers from New England founded
  Gravesend near the southern extremity of the borough. Finally, in the
  year 1645, a settlement was established near the site of the present
  borough hall, and was called Breuckelen (also spelled Breucklyn,
  Breuckland, Brucklyn, Broucklyn, Brookland and Brookline) until about the
  close of the 18th century, when its orthography became fixed as Brooklyn.
  The name, Breuckelen, meaning marsh land, seems to have been suggested by
  the resemblance of the situation of the settlement to that of Breuckelen,
  Holland. Of the other towns which were later united to form the borough,
  New Utrecht was settled about 1650, Flatbush (at first called Medwoud,
  Midwout or Midwood) about 1651, Bushwick and Williamsburg in 1660. All of
  the settlements were for a long time chiefly agricultural communities.
  Flatbush was for a few years immediately preceding 1675 the largest; but
  Brooklyn was the first (1646) to have a township organization, and within
  a few years Wallabout, Gowanus, The Ferry, and Bedford&mdash;a new
  settlement to the south-east of Wallabout, established in 1662&mdash;were
  included within its jurisdiction. In 1654 the municipal privileges of
  Brooklyn as well as of two of the other towns were enlarged, <!-- Page
  649 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page649"></a>[v.04
  p.0649]</span>but with Dutch rule there was general discontent, and when,
  in 1664, Colonel Richard Nicolls came to overthrow it and establish
  English rule these towns offered no resistance. Nicolls erected the
  region composed of Long Island, Staten Island and Westchester into a
  county under the name of Yorkshire, and divided it into three ridings, of
  which Staten Island, the present county of Kings, and the town of Newtown
  in Queens, formed one. In 1683 the present county of Kings was organized
  by the first colonial legislature. During the War of Independence the
  chief event was the battle of Long Island, fought on the 27th of August
  1776. In 1816, when the population of the town of Brooklyn was about
  4500, its most populous section was incorporated as a village; and in
  1834, when its population had increased to 23,310, the whole town was
  incorporated as a city. By 1850 its population had increased to 138,882.
  In 1855 Williamsburg, which had been incorporated as a city in 1851, and
  the town of Bushwick were annexed. Other annexations followed until the
  city of Brooklyn was conterminous with Kings county; and finally, on the
  1st of January 1898, the city of Brooklyn became a borough of New York
  City.</p>

  <p><b>BROOKS, CHARLES WILLIAM SHIRLEY</b> (1816-1874), English novelist,
  playwright and journalist, was born on the 29th of April 1816. He was the
  son of a London architect, and was articled in 1832 to a solicitor for
  five years. He became parliamentary reporter for the <i>Morning
  Chronicle</i>, and in 1853 was sent by that paper as special commissioner
  to investigate the subject of labour and the poor in southern Russia,
  Egypt and Syria; the result of his inquiries appearing first in the form
  of letters to the editor, and afterwards in a separate volume, under the
  title of <i>The Russians of the South</i> (1856). He wrote, sometimes
  alone, sometimes in conjunction with others, slight dramatic pieces of
  the burlesque kind, among which may be mentioned <i>Anything for a
  Change</i> (1848), <i>The Daughter of the Stars</i> (1850). Brooks was
  for many years on the staff of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>,
  contributing the weekly article on the politics of the day, and the two
  series entitled "Nothing in the Papers" and "By the Way." In 1851 he
  joined the staff of <i>Punch</i>, and noteworthy among his numerous
  contributions were the weekly satirical summaries of the parliamentary
  debates, entitled "The Essence of Parliament." His long service as
  newspaper reporter gave him special aptitude for this playful parody. In
  1870, on the death of Mark Lemon, "dear old Shirley," as his friends used
  to call him, was chosen to succeed to the editorial chair. His first
  novel, <i>Aspen Court</i>, was published in 1855. It was followed by
  <i>The Gordian Knot</i> (1860), <i>The Silver Cord</i> (1861) and
  <i>Sooner or Later</i> (1868). Brooks was a great letter-writer,
  deliberately cultivating the practice as an art, and imitating the style
  in vogue before newspapers and telegraphs suppressed private letters. He
  had an astonishing memory, was brilliant as an epigrammatist, was a great
  reader and a most genial companion. He was in his element with a group of
  children, reading to them, sharing their fun and always remembering the
  birthdays. He died in London, on the 23rd of February 1874, and was
  buried near his friends Leech and Thackeray, in Kensal Green
  cemetery.</p>

  <p><b>BROOKS, PHILLIPS</b> (1835-1893), American clergyman and author,
  was born in Boston, Mass., on the 13th of December 1835. Through his
  father, William Gray Brooks, he was descended from the Rev. John Cotton;
  through his mother, Mary Ann Phillips, a woman of rare force of character
  and religious faith, he was a great-grandson of the founder of Phillips
  Academy, Andover, Mass. Of the six sons, four&mdash;Phillips, Frederic,
  Arthur and John Cotton&mdash;entered the ministry of the Protestant
  Episcopal Church. Phillips Brooks prepared for college at the Boston
  Latin school and graduated at Harvard in 1855. After a short and
  unsuccessful experience as a teacher in the Boston Latin school, he began
  in 1856 to study for the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church in
  the theological seminary at Alexandria, Virginia. In 1859 he graduated,
  was ordained deacon by Bishop William Meade of Virginia, and became
  rector of the church of the Advent, Philadelphia. In 1860 he was ordained
  priest, and in 1862 became rector of the church of the Holy Trinity,
  Philadelphia, where he remained seven years, gaining an increasing name
  as preacher and patriot. Endowed by inheritance with a rich religious
  character, evangelical traditions, ethical temper and strong intellect,
  he developed, by wide reading in ancient and modern literature, a
  personality and attitude of mind which appealed to the characteristic
  thought and life of the period. With Tennyson, Coleridge, Frederic D.
  Maurice and F. W. Robertson he was in strong sympathy. During the Civil
  War he upheld with power the cause of the North and the negro, and his
  sermon on the death of President Lincoln was an eloquent expression of
  the character of both men. In 1869 he became rector of Trinity church,
  Boston. In 1877 the present church was finished, the architect being his
  friend H. H. Richardson. Here Phillips Brooks preached Sunday after
  Sunday to great congregations, until he was consecrated bishop of
  Massachusetts in 1891. In 1886 he declined an election as assistant
  bishop of Pennsylvania. He was for many years an overseer and preacher of
  Harvard University, his influence upon the religious life of the
  university being deep and wide. In 1881 he declined an invitation to be
  the sole preacher to the university and professor of Christian ethics. On
  the 30th of April 1891 he was elected sixth bishop of Massachusetts, and
  on the 14th of October was consecrated to that office in Trinity church,
  Boston. After a brief but great episcopate of fifteen months, he died,
  unmarried, on the 23rd of January 1893. Phillips Brooks was a tall,
  well-proportioned man of fine physique, his height being six feet four
  inches. In character he was pure, simple, endowed with excellent judgment
  and a keen sense of humour, and quick to respond to any call for
  sympathy. When kindled by his subject it seemed to take possession of him
  and pour itself out with overwhelming speed of utterance, with heat and
  power. His sympathy with men of other ways and thought, and with the
  truth in other ecclesiastical systems gained for him the confidence and
  affection of men of varied habits of mind and religious traditions, and
  was thus a great factor in gaining increasing support for the Episcopal
  Church. As years went by his influence as a religious leader became
  unique. The degree of S.T.D. had been conferred upon him by the
  universities of Harvard (1877), and of Columbia (1887), and the degree of
  D.D. by the university of Oxford, England (1885). In 1877 he published a
  course of lectures upon preaching, which he had delivered at the
  theological school of Yale University, and which are an expression of his
  own experience. In 1879 appeared the Bohlen Lectures on "The Influence of
  Jesus." In 1878 he published his first volume of sermons, and from time
  to time issued other volumes, including <i>Sermons Preached in English
  Churches</i> (1883).</p>

  <p><b>BROOM,</b> known botanically as <i>Cytisus</i>, or <i>Sarothamnus,
  scoparius</i>, a member of the natural order Leguminosae, a shrub found
  on heaths and commons in the British Isles, and also in Europe (except
  the north) and temperate Asia. The leaves are small, and the function of
  carbon-assimilating is shared by the green stems. The bright yellow
  flowers scatter their pollen by an explosive mechanism; the weight of a
  bee alighting on the flower causes the keel to split and the pollen to be
  shot out on to the insect's body. When ripe the black pods explode with a

  reputation as a diuretic; the seeds have similar properties.</p>

  <p>"Butcher's broom," a very different plant, known botanically as

  is a small evergreen shrub found in copses and woods, but rare in the
  southern half of England. The stout angular stems bear leaves reduced to
  small scales, which subtend flattened leaf-like branches (cladodes) with
  a sharp apex. The small whitish flowers are borne on the face of the
  cladodes, and are succeeded by a bright red berry.</p>

  <p><b>BROOME, WILLIAM</b> (1689-1745), English scholar and poet, the son
  of a farmer, was born at Haslington, Cheshire, where he was baptized on
  the 3rd of May 1689. He was educated at Eton, where he became captain of
  the school, and at St John's College, Cambridge. He collaborated with
  John Ozell and William Oldisworth in a translation (1712) of the
  <i>Iliad</i> from the French version of Madame Dacier, and he contributed
  in the same year some verses to <i>Lintot's Miscellany</i>. He was
  introduced to Pope, who was at that time engaged on his translation of
  the <i>Iliad</i>. Pope asked Broome to make a digest for him of the notes
  of Eustathius, the 12th-century annotator of Homer. This task Broome
  executed to Pope's entire satisfaction, refusing any payment. He was
  rector of Sturston, Norfolk, and his prosperity was further assured by
  his marriage in 1716 with a rich widow, Mrs Elizabeth Clarke. When Pope
  undertook the translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>, he engaged Elijah Fenton
  and Broome to assist him. Broome's facility in verse had gained for him
  at college the nickname of "the poet," and he adapted his style very
  closely to Pope's. He translated the 2nd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 12th, 16th,
  18th and 23rd books, and practically provided all the notes. He was a
  vain, talkative man, and did not fail to make known his real share in the
  translation, of which Pope had given a very misleading account in the
  "proposals" issued to subscribers. He casually mentioned Broome as his
  coadjutor, as though his assistance was of an entirely subsidiary
  character. His influence over Broome was so strong that the latter was
  induced to write a note at the end of the translation minimizing his own
  share and implicating Fenton, who, moreover, had not wished his name to
  appear, in the deception. "If my performance," he said, "has merit either
  in these [the notes] or in any part of the translation, namely the 6th,
  11th and 18th books, it is but just to attribute it to the judgment and
  care of Mr Pope, by whose hand every sheet was corrected." For the
  <i>Odyssey</i> Pope received £4500, of which Broome, who had provided a
  third of the text and the notes, received £570. He had hoped to secure
  fame from his connexion with Pope, and when he found that Pope had no
  intention of praising him he complained bitterly of being underpaid. Pope
  thought that Broome's garrulity had caused the reports which were being
  circulated to his disadvantage, and ungenerously made satirical allusions
  to him in the <i>Dunciad</i><a name="FnAnchor_161"
  href="#Footnote_161"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and the <i>Bathos</i>. After
  these insults Broome's patience gave way, and there is a gap in his
  correspondence with Pope, but in 1730 the intercourse was renewed on
  friendly terms. In 1728 the degree of LL.D. was conferred on him by the
  university of Cambridge, and he was presented to the rectory of Pulham,
  Norfolk, and subsequently by Charles, 1st Earl Cornwallis, who had been
  his friend at Cambridge, to two livings, Oakley Magna in Essex, and Eye
  in Suffolk. He died at Bath on the 16th of November 1745.</p>

  <p>Broome was also the author of some translations from Anacreon printed
  in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and of <i>Poems on Several
  Occasions</i> (1727). His poems are included in Johnson's and other
  collections of the British poets. His connexion with Pope is exhaustively
  discussed in Elwin and Courthope's edition of Pope's <i>Works</i> (viii.
  pp. 30-186), where the correspondence between the two is reproduced.</p>

  <p><b>BROOM-RAPE,</b> known botanically as <i>Orobanche</i>, a genus of
  brown leafless herbs growing attached to the roots of other plants from
  which they derive their nourishment. The usually stout stem bears
  brownish scales, and ends in a spike of yellow, reddish-brown or purplish
  flowers, with a gaping two-lipped corolla. Several species occur in the
  British Isles; the largest, <i>Orobanche major</i>, is parasitic on roots
  of shrubby leguminous plants, and has a stout stem 1 to 2 ft. high.</p>

  <p><b>BROSCH, MORITZ</b> (1829-1907), German historian, was born at
  Prague on the 7th of April 1829, was educated at Prague and Vienna, and
  became a journalist. Later he devoted himself to historical study, and he
  died on the 14th of July 1907 at Venice, where he had resided for over
  thirty years. To the series <i>Geschichte der europäischen Staaten</i>
  Brosch contributed <i>England 1509-1550</i> (6 vols., Gotha, 1884-1899),
  a continuation of the work of J.M. Lappenberg and R. Pauli, and <i>Der
  Kirchenstaat</i> (Gotha, 1880-1882). He gave further proof of his
  interest in English history by writing <i>Lord Bolingbroke und die Whigs
  und Tories seiner Zeit</i> (Frankfort, 1883), and <i>Oliver Cromwell und
  die puritanische Revolution</i> (Frankfort, 1886). He also wrote
  <i>Julius II. und die Gründung des Kirchenstaats</i> (Gotha, 1878), while
  one of his last pieces of work was to contribute a chapter on "The height
  of the Ottoman power" to vol. iii. of the <i>Cambridge Modern
  History</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BROSSES, CHARLES DE</b> (1709-1777), French magistrate and scholar,
  was born at Dijon and studied law with a view to the magistracy. The bent
  of his mind, however, was towards literature and science, and, after a
  visit to Italy in 1739 in company with his friend Jean Baptiste de
  Lacurne de Sainte-Palaye, he published his <i>Lettres sur l'état actuel
  de la mile souterraine d'Herculée</i> (Dijon, 1750), the first work upon
  the ruins of Herculaneum. It was during this Italian tour that he wrote
  his famous letters on Italy, which remained in MS. till long after his
  death. In 1760 he published a dissertation, <i>Du culte des dieux
  fétiches</i>, which was afterwards inserted in the <i>Encyclopédie
  méthodique</i>. At the solicitation of his friend Buffon, he undertook
  his <i>Histoire des navigations aux terres australes</i>, which was
  published in 1756, in two vols. 4to, with maps. It was in this work that
  de Brosses first laid down the geographical divisions of Australasia and
  Polynesia, which were afterwards adopted by John Pinkerton and succeeding
  geographers. He also contributed to the <i>Encyclopédie</i> the articles
  "Langues," "Musique," "Étymologic." In 1765 appeared his work on the
  origin of language, <i>Traite de la formation mécanique des langues</i>,
  the merits of which are recognized by E. B. Tylor in <i>Primitive
  Culture</i>. De Brosses had been occupied, during a great part of his
  life, on a translation of Sallust, and in attempting to supply the lost
  chapters in that celebrated historian. At length in 1777 he published
  <i>L'Histoire du septième siècle de la république romaine</i>, 3 vols.
  4to, to which is prefixed a learned life of Sallust, reprinted at the
  commencement of the translation of that historian by Jean Baptiste Dureau
  de La Malle. These literary occupations did not prevent the author from
  discharging with ability his official duties as first president of the
  parliament of Burgundy, nor from carrying on a constant and extensive
  correspondence with the most distinguished literary characters of his
  time. In 1758 he succeeded the marquis de Caumont in the Académie des
  Belles-lettres; but when in 1770 he presented himself at the French
  Academy, his candidature was rejected owing to Voltaire's opposition on
  personal grounds. Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote several
  memoirs and dissertations in the collections of the Academy of
  Inscriptions, and in those of the Academy of Dijon, and he left behind
  him several MSS., which were unfortunately lost during the Revolution.
  His letters on Italy were, however, found in MS. in the confiscated
  library by his son, the <i>émigré</i> officer René de Brosses, and were
  first published in 1799, in the uncritical edition of Antoine Serieys,
  under the title of <i>Lettres historiques et critiques</i>. A fresh
  edition, freed from errors and interpolations, by R. Colomb, with the
  title <i>L'Italie il y a cent ans</i>, was issued in 1836; and two
  subsequent reprints appeared, one edited by Poulet-Malassis, under the
  title <i>Lettres familières</i> (1858); the other, a re-impression of
  Colomb's edition, under that of <i>Le Président de Brosses en Italic</i>
  (1858).</p>

  <p><b>BROTHER</b>, a male person in his relation to the other children of
  the same father and mother. "Brother" represents in English the Teutonic
  branch of a word common to the Indo-European languages, of. Ger.
  <i>Bruder</i>, Dutch <i>broeder</i>, Dan. and Swed. <i>broder</i>,
  &amp;c. In Celtic languages, Gaelic and Irish have <i>brathair</i>, and
  Welsh <i>brawd</i>; in Greek the word is <span title="phratêr" class="grk"
  >&phi;&rho;&#x1F71;&tau;&eta;&rho;</span>, in Lat. <i>frater</i>, from
  which come the Romanic forms, Fr. <i>frère</i>, Ital. <i>fratello</i>;
  the Span. <i>fray</i>, Port. <i>frei</i>, like the Ital. <i>frate</i>,
  <i>fra</i>, are only used of "friars." The Span. <i>hermano</i> and the
  Port. <i>irm&#x101;o</i>, the regular words for brother, are from Lat.
  <i>germanus</i>, born of the same father and mother. The Sanskrit word is
  <i>bhr&#x101;t&#x101;r</i>, and the ultimate Indo-European root is
  generally taken to be <i>bhar</i>, to bear (cf. M. H. Ger. <i>barn</i>,
  Scot, <i>bairn</i>, child, and such words as "birth," "burden").
  "Brother" has often been loosely used of kinsmen generally, or for
  members of the same tribe; also for quite fictitious relationships,
  <i>e.g.</i> "blood-brothers," through a sacramental rite of mutual
  blood-tasting, "foster-brothers," because suckled by the same nurse.
  Christianity, through the idea of the universal fatherhood of God,
  conceives all men as brothers; but in a narrower sense "the brethren" are
  the members of the Church, or, in a narrower still, of a confraternity or
  "brotherhood" within the Church. This latter idea is reproduced in those
  fraternal societies, <i>e.g.</i> the Freemasons, the members of which
  become "brothers" by initiation. "Brother" is also used symbolically, as
  implying equality, by sovereigns in addressing one another, and also by
  bishops.</p>

  <p><b>BROTHERS, RICHARD</b> (1757-1824), British religious fanatic, was
  born in Newfoundland on Christmas day, 1757, and educated at Woolwich. He
  entered the navy and served under Keppel and Rodney. In 1783 he became
  lieutenant, and was discharged on half-pay. He travelled on the
  continent, made an unhappy marriage in 1786, and again went to sea. But
  he felt that the military calling and Christianity were incompatible and
  abandoned the former (1789). Further scruples as to the oath required on
  the receipt of his half-pay reduced him to serious pecuniary straits
  (1791), and he divided his time between the open air and the workhouse,
  where he developed the idea that he had a special divine commission, and
  wrote to the king and the parliament to that effect. In 1793 he declared
  himself the apostle of a new religion, "the nephew of the Almighty, and
  prince of the Hebrews, appointed to lead them to the land of Canaan." At
  the end of 1794 he began to print his interpretations of prophecy, his
  first book being <i>A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times</i>.
  In consequence of prophesying the death of the king and the end of the
  monarchy, he was arrested for treason in 1795, and confined as a criminal
  lunatic. His case was, however, brought before parliament by his ardent
  disciple, Nathaniel Halhed, the orientalist, a member of the House of
  Commons, and he was removed to a private asylum in Islington. Here he
  wrote a variety of prophetic pamphlets, which gained him many believers,
  amongst them William Sharp, the engraver, who afterwards deserted him for
  Joanna Southcott. Brothers, however, had announced that on the 19th of
  November 1795 he was to be "revealed" as prince of the Hebrews and ruler
  of the world; and when this date passed without any such manifestation,
  what enthusiasm he had aroused rapidly dwindled, despite the fact that
  some of his earlier political predictions (<i>e.g.</i> the violent death
  of Louis XVI.) had been fulfilled. He died in London on the 25th of
  January 1824, in the house of John Finlayson, who had secured his
  release, and who afterwards pestered the government with an enormous
  claim for Brothers's maintenance. The supporters of the Anglo-Israelite
  theory claim him as the first writer on their side.</p>

  <p><b>BROTHERS OF COMMON LIFE,</b> a religious community formerly
  existing in the Catholic Church. Towards the end of his career Gerhard
  Groot (<i>q.v.</i>) retired to his native town of Deventer, in the
  province of Overyssel and the diocese of Utrecht, and gathered about him
  a number of those who had been "converted" by his preaching or wished to
  place themselves under his spiritual guidance. With the assistance of
  Florentius Radewyn, who resigned for the purpose a canonry at Utrecht, he
  was able to carry out a long-cherished idea of establishing a house
  wherein devout men might live in community without the monastic vows. The
  first such community was established at Deventer in the house of
  Floentius himself (<i>c.</i> 1380); and Thomas à Kempis, who lived in it
  from 1392 to 1399, has left a description of the manner of life
  pursued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"They humbly imitated the manner of the Apostolic life, and having one
  heart and mind in God, brought every man what was his own into the common
  stock, and receiving simple food and clothing avoided taking thought for
  the morrow. Of their own will they devoted themselves to God, and all
  busied themselves in obeying their rector or his vicar .... They laboured
  carefully in copying books, being instant continually in sacred study and
  devout meditation. In the morning, having said Matins, they went to the
  church (for Mass) .... Some who were priests and were learned in the
  divine law preached earnestly in the church."</p>

<p><!-- Page 652 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page652"></a>[v.04 p.0652]</span></p>

  <p>Other houses of the Brothers of Common Life, otherwise called the
  "Modern Devotion," were in rapid succession established in the chief
  cities of the Low Countries and north and central Germany, so that there
  were in all upwards of forty houses of men; while those of women doubled
  that figure, the first having been founded by Groot himself at
  Deventer.</p>

  <p>The ground-idea was to reproduce the life of the first Christians as
  described in Acts iv. The members took no vows and were free to leave
  when they chose; but so long as they remained they were bound to observe
  chastity, to practise personal poverty, putting all their money and
  earnings into the common fund, to obey the rules of the house and the
  commands of the rector, and to exercise themselves in self-denial,
  humility and piety. The rector was chosen by the community and was not
  necessarily a priest, though in each house there were a few priests and
  clerics. The majority, however, were laymen, of all kinds and
  degrees&mdash;nobles, artisans, scholars, students, labouring men. The
  clerics preached and instructed the people, working chiefly among the
  poor; they also devoted themselves to the copying of manuscripts, in
  order thereby to earn something for the common fund; and some of them
  taught in the schools. Of the laymen, the educated copied manuscripts,
  the others worked at various handicrafts or at agriculture. After the
  religious services of the morning the Brothers scattered for the day's
  work, the artisans going to the workshops in the city,&mdash;for the idea
  was to live and work in the world, and not separated from it, like the
  monks. Their rule was that they had to earn their livelihood, and must
  not beg. This feature seemed a reflection on the mendicant orders, and
  the idea of a community life without vows and not in isolation from
  everyday life, was looked upon as something new and strange, and even as
  bearing affinities to the Beghards and other sects, at that time causing
  trouble to both Church and state. And so opposition arose to the Modern
  Devotion, and the controversy was carried to the legal faculty at Cologne
  University, which gave a judgment strongly in their favour. The question,
  for all that, was not finally settled until the council of Constance
  (1414), when their cause was triumphantly defended by Pierre d'Ailly and
  Gerson. For a century after this the Modern Devotion flourished
  exceedingly, and its influence on the revival of religion in the
  Netherlands and north Germany in the 15th century was wide and deep. It
  has been the fashion to treat Groot and the Brothers of Common Life as
  "Reformers before the Reformation"; but Schulze, in the Protestant
  <i>Realencyklopädie</i>, is surely right in pronouncing this view quite
  unhistorical&mdash;except on the theory that all interior spiritual
  religion is Protestant: he shows that at the Reformation hardly any of
  the Brothers embraced Lutheranism, only a single community going over as
  a body to the new religion. During the second half of the 16th century
  the institute gradually declined, and by the middle of the 17th all its
  houses had ceased to exist.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The chief authorities are
  Thomas à Kempis, <i>Lives of Groot and his Disciples</i> and <i>Chronicle
  of Mount St Agnes</i> (both works translated by J.P. Arthur, the former
  under the title <i>Founders of the New Devotion</i>, 1905); Busch,
  <i>Chronicle of Windesheim</i> (ed. Grube, 1887). Much has been written
  on the subject in Dutch and German; in English, S. Kettlewell, <i>Thomas
  à Kempis and the Brothers of Common Life</i> (1882) (but see Arthur in
  the Prefaces to above-named books); for a shorter sketch, F.R. Cruise,
  <i>Thomas à Kempis</i> (1887). An excellent article in Herzog-Hauck,
  <i>Realencyklopädie</i> (3rd ed.), "Brüder des gemeinsamen Lebens,"
  supplies copious information with references to all the literature; see
  also Max Heimbucher, <i>Orden und Kongregationen</i> (1897), ii. § 123.
  The part played by the Brothers of Common Life in the religious and
  educational movements of the time may be studied in Ludwig Pastor's
  <i>History of the Popes from the close of the Middle Ages</i>, or J.
  Janssen's <i>History of the German People</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BROUGH, ROBERT</b> (1872-1905), British painter, was born at
  Invergordon, Ross-shire. He was educated at Aberdeen, and, whilst
  apprenticed for over six years as lithographer to Messrs Gibb &amp; Co.,
  attended the night classes at the local art school. He then entered the
  Royal Scottish Academy, and in the first year took the Stuart prize for
  figure painting, the Chalmers painting bursary, and the Maclaine-Walters
  medal for composition. After two years in Paris under J.P. Laurens and
  Benjamin-Constant at Julian's <i>atelier</i>, he settled in Aberdeen in
  1894 as a portrait painter and political cartoonist. A portrait of Mr
  W.D. Ross first drew attention to his talent in 1896, and in the
  following year he scored a marked success at the Royal Academy with his
  "Fantaisie en Folie," now at the National Gallery of British Art (Tate
  Gallery). Two of his paintings, "'Twixt Sun and Moon" and "Childhood of
  St Anne of Brittany," are at the Venice municipal gallery. Brough's art
  is influenced by Raeburn and by modern French training, but it strikes a
  very personal note. Robert Brough met his death from injuries received in
  a railway disaster in 1905, his early death being a notable loss to
  British art.</p>

  <p><b>BROUGHAM, JOHN</b> (1814-1880), British actor, was born at Dublin
  on the 9th of May 1814, and was educated for a surgeon. Owing to family
  misfortunes he was thrown upon his own resources and made his first
  appearance on the London stage in 1830, at the Tottenham Street theatre
  in <i>Tom and Jerry</i>, in which he played six characters. In 1831 he
  was a member of Madame Vestris's company, and wrote his first play, a
  burlesque. He remained with Madame Vestris as long as she and Charles
  Mathews retained Covent Garden, and he collaborated with Dion Boucicault
  in writing <i>London Assurance</i>, Dazzle being one of his best parts.
  In 1840 he managed the Lyceum theatre, for which he wrote several light
  burlesques, but in 1842 he moved to the United States, where he became a
  member of W.E. Burton's company, for which he wrote several comedies.
  Later he was the manager of Niblo's Garden, and in 1850 opened Brougham's
  Lyceum, which, like his next speculation, the lease of the Bowery
  theatre, was not financially a success. He was later connected with
  Wallack's and Daly's theatres, and wrote plays for both. In 1860 he
  returned to London, where he adapted or wrote several plays, including
  <i>The Duke's Motto</i> for Fechter. After the Civil War he returned to
  New York. Brougham's theatre was opened in 1869 with his comedy <i>Better
  Late than Never</i>, but this managerial experience was also unfortunate,
  and he took to playing with various stock companies. His last appearance
  was in 1879 as O'Reilly, the detective, in Boucicault's <i>Rescued</i>,
  and he died in New York on the 7th of June 1880. Brougham was the author
  of nearly 100 plays, most of them now forgotten. He was the founder of
  the Lotus Club in New York, and for a time its president. He also edited
  there in 1852 a comic paper called <i>The Lantern</i>, and published two
  collections of miscellaneous writings, <i>A Basket of Chips</i> and
  <i>The Bunsby Papers</i>. Brougham is said to have been the original of
  Harry Lorrequer in Charles Lever's novel. He was twice married, in 1838
  to Emma Williams (d. 1865), and in 1844 to Mrs Annette Hawley (d. 1870),
  both actresses.</p>

  <p><b>BROUGHAM,</b> a four-wheeled closed carriage, seating two or more
  persons, and drawn by a single horse or pair, or propelled by motor. The
  modern "brougham" has developed and taken its name from the "odd little
  kind of garden-chair" described by Thomas Moore, which the first Lord
  Brougham had made by a coachmaker to his own design.</p>

  <p><b>BROUGHAM</b> <span class="scac">AND</span> <b>VAUX, HENRY PETER
  BROUGHAM,</b> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1778-1868), lord
  chancellor of England, was born at Edinburgh on the 19th of September
  1778. He was the eldest son of Henry Brougham and Eleanora, daughter of
  the Rev. James Syme. In his later years he was wont to trace his paternal
  descent to Uduardus de Broham, in the reign of Henry II., but no real
  connexion has been established between the ancient lords of Brougham
  castle, whose inheritance passed by marriage from the Viponts into the
  family of the De Cliffords, and the Broughams of Scales Hall, from whom
  the chancellor was really descended. Entering the high school of
  Edinburgh when barely seven, he left, having risen to be head of the
  school, in 1791. He entered the university of Edinburgh in 1792, and
  devoted himself chiefly to the study of natural science and mathematics,
  contributing in 1795 a paper to the Royal Society on some new phenomenon
  of light and colours, which was printed in the <i>Transactions</i> of
  that body. A paper on porisms was published in the same manner in 1798,
  and in 1803 his scientific <!-- Page 653 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page653"></a>[v.04 p.0653]</span>reputation was so far established
  that he was elected F.R.S., But in spite of his taste for mathematical
  reasoning, Brougham's mind was not an accurate or exact one; and his
  pursuit of physical science was rather a favourite recreation than a
  solid advantage to him.</p>

  <p>For two years of his university career he had attended lectures in
  civil law, and having adopted law as a profession he was admitted to the
  faculty of advocates in 1800. It does not appear that he ever held a
  brief in the court of session, but he went a circuit or two, where he
  defended or prosecuted a few prisoners, and played a series of tricks on
  the presiding judge, Lord Eskgrove, which almost drove that learned
  person to distraction. The Scottish bar, however, as he soon perceived,
  offered no field sufficiently ample for his talents and his ambition. He
  resolved to go to London, where he had already appeared as junior counsel
  in a Scottish appeal to the House of Lords. In 1803 he entered at
  Lincoln's Inn, and in 1808 he was called to the English bar. In the
  meantime he had turned to literature as a means of subsistence. When in
  1802 the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was founded by the young and aspiring
  lights of the northern metropolis, Brougham was the most ready, the most
  versatile and the most satirical of all its contributors. To the first
  twenty numbers he contributed eighty articles, wandering through every
  imaginable subject,&mdash;science, politics, colonial policy, literature,
  poetry, surgery, mathematics and the fine arts. The prodigious success of
  the <i>Review</i>, and the power he was known to wield in it, made him a
  man of mark from his first arrival in London. He obtained the friendship
  of Lord Grey and the leading Whig politicians. His wit and gaiety made
  him an ornament of society, and he sought to extend his literary and
  political reputation by the publication of an elaborate work on the
  colonial policy of the empire. In 1806, Fox being then in office, he was
  appointed secretary to a mission of Lord Rosslyn and Lord St Vincent to
  the court of Lisbon, with a view to counteract the anticipated French
  invasion of Portugal. The mission lasted two or three months; Brougham
  came home out of humour and out of pocket; and meantime the death of Fox
  put an end to the hopes of the Whigs.</p>

  <p>Brougham was disappointed by the abrupt fall of the ministry, and
  piqued that his Whig friends had not provided him with a seat in
  parliament. Nevertheless, he exerted his pen with prodigious activity
  during the election of 1809; and Lord Holland declared that he had filled
  the booksellers' shops with articles and pamphlets. The result was small.
  No seat was placed at his disposal, and he was too poor to contest a
  borough. He was fortunate at this time to ally himself with the movement
  for the abolition of the slave-trade, and he remained through life not
  only faithful, but passionately attached to the cause. Indeed, one of the
  first measures he carried in the House of Commons was a bill to make the
  slave-trade felony, and he had the happiness, as chancellor of England,
  to take a part in the final measure of negro emancipation throughout the
  colonies.</p>

  <p>Previous to his entering on practice at the English bar, Brougham had
  acquired some knowledge of international law, and some experience of the
  prize courts. This circumstance probably led to his being retained as
  counsel for the Liverpool merchants who had petitioned both Houses of
  Parliament against the Orders in Council. Brougham conducted the
  lengthened inquiry which took place at the bar of the House, and he
  displayed on this occasion a mastery over the principles of political
  economy and international law which at that time was rare. Nevertheless,
  he was unsuccessful, and it was not until 1812, when he was himself in
  parliament, that he resumed his attack on the Orders in Council, and
  ultimately conquered. It was considered inexpedient and impossible that a
  man so gifted, and so popular as Brougham had now become, should remain
  out of parliament, and by the influence of Lord Holland the duke of
  Bedford was induced to return him to the House of Commons for the borough
  of Camelford. He took his seat early in 1810, having made a vow that he
  would not open his mouth for a month. The vow was kept, but kept for that
  month only. He spoke in March in condemnation of the conduct of Lord
  Chatham at Walcheren, and he went on speaking for the rest of his life.
  In four months, such was the position he had acquired in the House that
  he was regarded as a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal party,
  then in the feeble hands of George Ponsonby. However, the Tories
  continued in power. Parliament was dissolved. Camelford passed into other
  hands. Brougham was induced to stand for Liverpool, with Thomas Creevey
  against Canning and General Gascoyne. The Liberals were defeated by a
  large majority, and what made the sting of defeat more keen was that
  Creevey retained his old seat for Thetford, while Brougham was left out
  in the cold.</p>

  <p>He remained out of parliament during the four eventful years from 1812
  to 1816, which witnessed the termination of the war, and he did not
  conceal his resentment against the Whigs. But in the years he spent out
  of parliament occurrences took place which gave ample employment to his
  bustling activity, and led the way to one of the most important passages
  of his life. He had been introduced in 1809 to the princess of Wales
  (afterwards Queen Caroline). But it was not till 1812 that the princess
  consulted him on her private affairs, after the rupture between the
  prince regent and the Whigs had become more decided. From that time,
  Brougham, in conjunction with Samuel Whitbread, became one of the
  princess's chief advisers; he was attached to her service, not so much
  from any great liking or respect for herself, as from an indignant sense
  of the wrongs and insults inflicted upon her by her husband. Brougham
  strongly opposed her departure from England in 1814, as well as her
  return in 1820 on the accession of George IV.</p>

  <p>In 1816 he had again been returned to parliament for Winchelsea, a
  borough of the earl of Darlington, and he instantly resumed a commanding
  position in the House of Commons. He succeeded in defeating the
  continuance of the income-tax; he distinguished himself as an advocate
  for the education of the people; and on the death of Romilly he took up
  with ardour the great work of the reform of the law. Nothing exasperated
  the Tory party more than the select committee which sat, with Brougham in
  the chair, in 1816 and the three following years, to investigate the
  state of education of the poor in the metropolis. But he was as far as
  ever from obtaining the leadership of the party to which he aspired.
  Indeed, as was pointed out by Lord Lansdowne in 1817, the opposition had
  no recognized efficient leaders; their warfare was carried on in separate
  courses, indulging their own tastes and tempers, without combined action.
  Nor was Brougham much more successful at the bar. The death of George
  III. suddenly changed this state of things. Queen Caroline at once, in
  April 1820, appointed Brougham her attorney-general, and Denman her
  solicitor-general; and they immediately took their rank in court
  accordingly; this was indeed the sole act of royal authority on the part
  of the unhappy queen. In July Queen Caroline came from St Omer to
  England; ministers sent down to both Houses of Parliament the secret
  evidence which they had long been collecting against her; and a bill was
  brought into the House of Lords for the deposition of the queen, and the
  dissolution of the king's marriage. The defence of the queen was
  conducted by Brougham, assisted by Denman, Lushington and Wilde, with
  equal courage and ability. His conduct of the defence was most able, and
  he wound up the proceedings with a speech of extraordinary power and
  effect. The peroration was said to have been written and rewritten by him
  seventeen times. At moments of great excitement such declamation may be
  of value, and in 1820 it was both heard and read with enthusiasm. But to
  the calmer judgment of later generations this celebrated oration seems
  turgid and overstrained. Such immense popular sympathy prevailed on the
  queen's behalf, that the ministry did not proceed with the bill in the
  Commons, and the result was a virtual triumph for the queen.</p>

  <p>This victory over the court and the ministry raised Henry Brougham at
  once to the pinnacle of fame. He shared the triumph of the queen. His
  portrait was in every shop window. A piece of plate was presented to him,
  paid for by a penny subscription of peasants and mechanics. He refused to
  accept a sum of £4000 which the queen herself placed at his disposal;
  <!-- Page 654 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page654"></a>[v.04
  p.0654]</span>he took no more than the usual fees of counsel, while his
  salary as Her Majesty's attorney-general remained unpaid, until it was
  discharged by the treasury after her death. But from that moment his
  fortune was made at the bar. His practice on the northern circuit
  quintupled. One of his finest speeches was a defence of a Durham
  newspaper which had attacked the clergy for refusing to allow the bells
  of churches to be tolled on the queen's death; and by the admission of
  Lord Campbell, a rival advocate and an unfriendly critic, he rose
  suddenly to a position unexampled in the profession. The meanness of
  George IV. and of Lord Eldon refused him the silk gown to which his
  position at the bar entitled him, and for some years he led the circuit
  as an outer barrister, to the great loss of the senior members of the
  circuit, who could only be employed against him. His practice rose to
  about £7000 a year, but it was again falling off before he became
  chancellor.</p>

  <p>It may here be mentioned that in 1825 the first steps were taken,
  under the auspices of Brougham, for the establishment of a university in
  London, absolutely free from all religious or sectarian distinctions. In
  1827 he contributed to found the "Society for the Diffusion of Useful
  Knowledge"&mdash;an association which gave an immense impulse to sound
  popular literature. Its first publication was an essay on the "Pleasures
  and Advantages of Science" written by himself. In the following year
  (1828) he delivered his great speech on law reform, which lasted six
  hours, in a thin and exhausted House,&mdash;a marvellous effort,
  embracing every part of the existing system of judicature.</p>

  <p>The death of Canning, the failure of Lord Goderich, and the accession
  of the duke of Wellington to power, again changed the aspect of affairs.
  The progress of the movement for parliamentary reform had numbered the
  days of the Tory government. At the general election of 1830 the county
  of York spontaneously returned Brougham to the new House of Commons as
  their representative. The parliament met in November. Brougham's first
  act was to move for leave to bring in a bill to amend the representation
  of the people; but before the debate came on the government was defeated
  on another question; the duke resigned, and Earl Grey was commanded by
  William IV. to form an administration.</p>

  <p>Amongst the difficulties of the new premier and the Whig party were
  the position and attitude of Brougham. He was not the leader of any
  party, and had no personal following in the House of Commons. Moreover,
  he himself had repeatedly declared that nothing would induce him to
  exchange his position as an independent member of parliament for any
  office, however great. On the day following the resignation of the Tory
  government, he reluctantly consented to postpone for one week his motion
  on parliamentary reform. The attorney-generalship was offered to him and
  indignantly refused. He himself affirms that he desired to be master of
  the rolls, which would have left him free to sit in the House of Commons.
  But this was positively interdicted by the king, and objected to by Lord
  Althorp, who declared that he could not undertake to lead the House with
  so insubordinate a follower behind him. But as it was impossible to leave
  Brougham out of the ministry, it was determined to offer him the
  chancellorship. Brougham himself hesitated, or affected to hesitate, but
  finally yielded to the representations of Lord Grey and Lord Althorp. On
  the 22nd of November the great seal was delivered to him by the king, and
  he was raised to the peerage as Baron Brougham and Vaux. His
  chancellorship lasted exactly four years.</p>

  <p>Lord Brougham took a most active and prominent part in all the great
  measures promoted by Grey's government, and the passing of the Reform
  Bill was due in a great measure to the vigour with which he defended it.
  But success developed traits which had hitherto been kept in the
  background. His manner became dictatorial and he exhibited a restless
  eccentricity, and a passion for interfering with every department of
  state, which alarmed the king. By his insatiable activity he had
  contrived to monopolize the authority and popularity of the government,
  and notwithstanding the immense majority by which it was supported in the
  reformed parliament, a crisis was not long in arriving. Lord Grey
  resigned, but very much by Brougham's exertions the cabinet was
  reconstructed under Lord Melbourne, and he appeared to think that his own
  influence in it would be increased. But the irritability of his temper
  and the egotism of his character made it impossible for his colleagues to
  work with him, and the extreme mental excitement under which he laboured
  at this time culminated during a journey to Scotland in a behaviour so
  extravagant, that it gave the final stroke to the confidence of the king.
  At Lancaster he joined the bar-mess, and spent the night in an orgy. In a
  country house he lost the great seal, and found it again in a game of
  blindman's-buff. At Edinburgh, in spite of the coldness which had sprung
  up between himself and the Grey family, he was present at a banquet given
  to the late premier, and delivered a harangue on his own services and his
  public virtue. All this time he continued to correspond with the king in
  a strain which created the utmost irritation and amazement at
  Windsor.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the meeting of parliament in November the king dismissed
  his ministers. The chancellor, who had dined at Holland House, called on
  Lord Melbourne on his way home, and learned the intelligence. Melbourne
  made him promise that he would keep it a secret until the morrow, but the
  moment he quitted the ex-premier he sent a paragraph to <i>The Times</i>
  relating the occurrence, and adding that "the queen had done it all."
  That statement, which was totally unfounded, was the last act of his
  official life. The Peel ministry, prematurely and rashly summoned to
  power, was of no long duration, and Brougham naturally took an active
  part in overthrowing it. Lord Melbourne was called upon in April 1835 to
  reconstruct the Whig government with his former colleagues. But,
  formidable as he might be as an opponent, the Whigs had learned by
  experience that Brougham was even more dangerous to them as an ally, and
  with one accord they resolved that he should not hold the great seal or
  any other office. The great seal was put in commission, to divert for a
  time his resentment, and leave him, if he chose, to entertain hopes of
  recovering it. These hopes, however, were soon dissipated; and although
  the late chancellor assumed an independent position in the House of
  Lords, and even affected to protect the government, his resentment
  against his "noble friends" soon broke out with uncontrolled vehemence.
  Throughout the session of 1835 his activity was undiminished. Bills for
  every imaginable purpose were thrown by him on the table of the House,
  and it stands recorded in Hansard that he made no less than 221 reported
  speeches in parliament in that year. But in the course of the vacation a
  heavier blow was struck: Lord Cottenham was made lord chancellor.
  Brougham's daring and arrogant spirit sank for a time under the shock,
  and during the year 1836 he never spoke in parliament. Among the numerous
  expedients resorted to in order to keep his name before the public, was a
  false report of his death by a carriage accident, sent up from
  Westmorland in 1839. He was accused, with great probability, of being
  himself the author of the report. Such credence did it obtain that all
  the newspapers of October 22, excepting <i>The Times</i>, had obituary
  notices. However, for more than thirty years after his fall he continued
  to take an active part in the judicial business of the House of Lords,
  and in its debates; but it would have been better for his reputation if
  he had died earlier. His reappearance in parliament on the accession of
  Queen Victoria was marked by sneers at the court, and violent attacks on
  the Whigs for their loyal and enthusiastic attachment to their young
  sovereign; and upon the outbreak of the insurrection in Canada, and the
  miscarriage of Lord Durham's mission, he overwhelmed his former
  colleagues, and especially Lord Glenelg, with a torrent of invective and
  sarcasm, equal in point of oratory to the greatest of his earlier
  speeches. Indeed, without avowedly relinquishing his political
  principles, Brougham estranged himself from the whole party by which
  those principles were defended; and his conduct in general during the
  years following his loss of office revealed his character in a very
  unfavourable light. He continued, however, to render judicial services in
  the privy council, and the House of Lords. The privy council, especially
  when hearing appeals from the colonies, India, and the courts maritime
  and ecclesiastical was his favourite tribunal; its vast range of <!--
  Page 655 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page655"></a>[v.04
  p.0655]</span>jurisdiction, varied by questions of foreign and
  international law, suited his discursive genius. He had remodelled the
  judicial committee in 1833, and it still remains one of the most useful
  of his creations.</p>

  <p>In the year 1860 a second patent was conferred upon him by Queen
  Victoria, with a reversion of his peerage to his youngest brother,
  William Brougham (d. 1886). The preamble of this patent stated that this
  unusual mark of honour was conferred upon him by the crown as an
  acknowledgment of the great services he had rendered, more especially in
  promoting the abolition of slavery, and the emancipation of the negro
  race. The peerage was thus perpetuated in a junior branch of the family,
  Lord Brougham himself being without an heir. He had married in 1821 Mrs
  Spalding (d. 1865), daughter of Thomas Eden, and had two daughters, the
  survivor of whom died in 1839. Brougham's last days were passed at
  Cannes, in the south of France. An accident having attracted his
  attention to the spot about the year 1838, when it was little more than a
  fishing village on a picturesque coast, he bought there a tract of land
  and built on it. His choice and his example made it the sanatorium of
  Europe. He died there on the 7th of May 1868, in the ninetieth year of
  his age.</p>

  <p>The verdict of the time has proved that there was nothing of
  permanence, and little of originality in the prodigious efforts of
  Brougham's genius. He filled the office of chancellor during times
  burning with excitement, and he himself embodied and expressed the
  fervour of the times. He affected at first to treat the business of the
  court of chancery as a light affair, though in truth he had to work hard
  to master the principles of equity, of which he had no experience. His
  manner in court was desultory and dictatorial. Sometimes he would crouch
  in his chair, muffled in his wig and robes, like a man asleep; at other
  times he would burst into restless activity, writing letters, working
  problems, interrupting counsel. But upon the whole Brougham was a just
  and able judge, though few of his decisions are cited as landmarks of the
  law.</p>

  <p>As a parliamentary figure Brougham's personality excited for many
  years an immense amount of public interest, now somewhat hard to
  comprehend. His boundless command of language, his animal spirits and
  social powers, his audacity and well-stored memory enabled him to
  dominate the situation. His striking and almost grotesque personal
  appearance, added to the effect of his voice and manner&mdash;a tall
  disjointed frame, with strong bony limbs and hands, that seemed to
  interpret the power of his address; strange angular motions of the arms;
  the incessant jerk of his harsh but expressive features; the modulations
  of his voice, now thundering in the loudest tones of indignation, now
  subdued to a whisper&mdash;all contributed to give him the magical
  influence such as is excited by a great actor. But his eccentricity rose
  at times to the verge of insanity; and with all his powers he lacked the
  moral elevation which inspires confidence and wins respect.</p>

  <p>The activity of Lord Brougham's pen was only second to the volubility
  of his tongue. He carried on a vast and incessant correspondence of
  incredible extent. For thirty years he contributed largely to the
  <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and he continued to write in that journal even
  after he held the great seal. The best of his writings, entitled
  "Sketches of the Statesmen of the time of George III.", first appeared in
  the <i>Review</i>. These were followed by the "Lives of Men of Letters
  and Science," of the same period. Later in life he edited Paley's
  <i>Natural Theology</i>; and he published a work on political philosophy,
  besides innumerable pamphlets and letters to public men on the events of
  the day. He published an incorrect translation of Demosthenes' <i>De
  Corona</i>. A novel entitled <i>Albert Lunel</i> was attributed to him. A
  fragment of the <i>History of England under the House of Lancaster</i>
  employed his retirement. In 1838 was published an edition of his speeches
  in four volumes, elaborately corrected by himself. The last of his works
  was his posthumous <i>Autobiography</i>. Ambitious as he was of literary
  fame, and jealous of the success of other authors, he has failed to
  obtain any lasting place in English literature. His style was slovenly,
  involved and incorrect; and his composition bore marks of haste and
  carelessness, and nowhere shows any genuine originality of thought. The
  collected edition of his works and speeches carefully revised by himself
  (Edinburgh, 1857 and 1872) is the best. His <i>Autobiography</i> is of
  some value from the original letters with which it is interspersed. But
  Lord Brougham's memory was so much impaired when he began to write his
  recollections that no reliance can be placed on his statements, and the
  work abounds in manifest errors. Nor was his regard for truth at any time
  unimpeachable, and the accounts which he gave of more than one
  transaction in which he played a prominent part were found on
  investigation to be unfounded.</p>

  <p>The best modern account of Brougham is J.B. Atlay's, in his
  <i>Victorian Chancellors</i> (1906); Lord Campbell's, in <i>Lives of the
  Chancellors</i>, is spiteful, and by an unfriendly though well-informed
  critic; the Rev. W. Hunt's judicious and careful biography in the
  <i>D.N.B.</i> is somewhat lacking in colour; Henry Reeve's article in the
  9th ed. of the <i>Ency. Brit.</i>, which is frequently drawn upon above,
  now requires a good many corrections in points of fact and perspective,
  but gives a brilliant picture by an appreciative critic, much "behind the
  scenes." See also references in the <i>Greville Memoirs</i> and
  <i>Creevey Papers</i>; S. Walpole, <i>History of England</i> (1890); J.A.

  <p><b>BROUGHTON, HUGH</b> (1549-1612), English scholar and divine, was
  born at Owlbury, Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, in 1549. He was educated by
  Bernard Gilpin at Houghton-le-Spring and at Cambridge, where he became
  fellow of St John's and then of Christ's, and took orders. Here he laid
  the foundation of the Hebrew scholarship for which he was afterwards so
  distinguished. From Cambridge he went to London, where his eloquence
  gained him many and powerful friends. In 1588 he published his first
  work, "a little book of great pains," entitled <i>A Concent of
  Scripture</i>. This work, dealing with biblical chronology and textual
  criticism, was attacked at both universities, and the author was obliged
  to defend it in a series of lectures. In 1589 he went to Germany, where
  he frequently engaged in discussions both with Romanists and with the
  learned Jews whom he met at Frankfort and elsewhere. In 1591 he returned
  to England, but his Puritan leanings incurred the hostility of Whitgift.
  Accordingly in 1592 he once more went abroad, and cultivated the
  acquaintance of the principal scholars of Europe, including Scaligeri and
  Rabbi Elias. Such was the esteem in which he was held, even by his
  opponents, that he might have had a cardinal's hat if he had been willing
  to change his faith. In 1599 he published his "Explication" of the
  article "He descended into hell," in which he maintained that Hades means
  simply the abode of departed spirits, not the place of torment. On the
  accession of James he returned to England; but not being engaged to
  co-operate in the new translation of the Bible (though he had for some
  years planned a similar work), he retired to Middleburg in Holland, where
  he preached to the English congregation. In 1611 he returned to England,
  where he died on the 4th of August 1612.</p>

  <p>Some of his works were collected and published in a large folio volume
  in 1662, with a sketch of his life by John Lightfoot, but many of his
  theological MSS. remain still unedited in the British Museum.</p>

  became very intimate with Byron, who accompanied him on a tour in Spain,
  Greece and Turkey in 1809. Hobhouse was present at the battle of Dresden
  in August 1813, and, following the allied army into France, saw Louis

  pamphlet entitled <i>The substance of some letters written by an
  Englishman resident in Paris during the last reign of the emperor
  Napoleon</i>. This caused some offence in England and more in France, and
  the French translation was seized by the government and both translator
  and printer were imprisoned. A further period of travel with Byron
  followed, and at this time Hobhouse wrote some notes to the fourth canto
  of <i>Childe Harold</i>. This canto was afterwards dedicated to him, and
  a revised edition of a part of his notes entitled <i>Historical
  illustrations of the fourth canto of "Childe Harold" containing
  dissertations on the ruins of Rome and an essay on Italian
  literature</i>, was published in 1818. In February 1819 Hobhouse was the
  Radical candidate at a by-election for the representation of the city of
  Westminster, but he failed to secure election. He had already gained some
  popularity by writing in favour of reform, and in 1819 he issued <i>A
  defence of the People in reply to Lord Erskine's "Two Defences of the
  Whigs,"</i> followed by <i>A trifling mistake in Thomas, Lord Erskine's
  recent preface</i>. The House of Commons declared this latter pamphlet a
  breach of privilege; its author was arrested on the 14th of December
  1819, and in spite of an appeal to the court of king's bench he remained
  in custody until the end of the following February. But this proceeding
  only increased his popularity, and at the general election of 1820 he was
  returned for Westminster. Hobhouse shared Byron's enthusiasm for the
  liberation of Greece; after the poet's death in 1824 he proved his will,
  and superintended the arrangements for his funeral. In parliament he
  proved a valuable recruit to the party of reform; and having succeeded
  his father as 2nd baronet in 1831, was appointed secretary at war in the
  ministry of Earl Grey in February 1832, and was made a privy councillor.
  He effected some reforms and economies during his tenure of this office,
  but, unable to carry out all his wishes, became chief secretary for
  Ireland in March 1833. He had only held this post for a few weeks when,
  in consequence of his refusal to vote with the government against the
  abolition of the house and window tax, he resigned both his office and
  his seat in parliament. At the subsequent election he was defeated, but
  joined the cabinet as first commissioner of woods and forests when Lord
  Melbourne took office in July 1834, and about the same time was returned
  at a by-election as one of the members for Nottingham. In Melbourne's
  government of 1835 he was president of the board of control, in which
  position he strongly supported the Indian policy of Lord Auckland; he
  returned to the same office in July 1846 as a member of Lord John
  Russell's cabinet; and in February 1851 he went to the House of Lords as
  Baron Broughton of Broughton Gyfford. He left office when Russell
  resigned in February 1852, and took little part in political life, being
  mainly occupied in literary pursuits and in correspondence. He died in
  London on the 3rd of June 1869.</p>

  <p>He had married in July 1828 Lady Julia Tomlinson Hay, daughter of
  George, 7th marquess of Tweeddale, by whom he had three daughters, but
  being without heir male the barony lapsed on his death, the baronetcy
  passing to his nephew, Charles Parry Hobhouse. Lord Broughton was a
  partner in Whitbread's brewery, a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of
  the founders of the Royal Geographical Society. He was responsible for
  the passing of the Vestry Act of 1831, and is said to have first used the
  phrase "his majesty's opposition." He was a good classical scholar, and
  although not eloquent, an able debater. In addition to the works already
  enumerated he wrote <i>A journey through Albania and other provinces of
  Turkey in Europe and Asia to Constantinople during the years 1809 and
  1810</i> (London, 1813), revised edition (London, 1855); and <i>Italy:
  Remarks made in Several Visits from the Year 1816 to 1854</i> (London,
  1859). A collection of his diaries, correspondence and memoranda is in
  the British Museum.</p>

  <p><b>BROUGHTY FERRY,</b> a municipal and police burgh, seaport and
  watering-place of Forfarshire, Scotland, on the Firth of Tay, 4 m. E. of
  Dundee by the North British railway. Pop. (1901) 10,484. The name is a
  corruption of Brugh or Burgh Tay, in allusion to the fortress standing on
  the rock that juts into the Firth. It is believed that a stronghold has
  occupied this site since Pictish times. The later castle, built in 1498,
  fell into the hands of the English in 1547 and was held by them for three
  years. Gradually growing more or less ruinous it was acquired by
  government in 1855, repaired, strengthened and converted into a Tay
  defence, mounting several heavy guns. Owing to its healthy and convenient
  situation, Broughty Ferry has become a favourite residence of Dundee
  merchants. Fishery and shipping are carried on to a limited extent.
  Before the erection of the Tay Bridge the town was the scene of much
  traffic, as the railway ferry from Tayport was then the customary access
  to Dundee from the south. Monifieth (pop. 2134), 2¼ m. north-east of
  Broughty Ferry, with a station on the North British railway, is noted for
  its golf links. About 2 m. north rises the conical hill of Laws (400 ft.
  high), on the top of which are the remains of a vitrified fort, 390 ft.
  long by 198 ft. in breadth.</p>

  <p><b>BROUSSAIS, FRANÇOIS JOSEPH VICTOR</b> (1772-1838), French
  physician, was born at St Malo on the 17th of December 1772. From his
  father, who was also a physician, he received his first instructions in
  medicine, and he studied for some years at the college of Dinan. At the
  age of seventeen he entered one of the newly-formed republican regiments,
  but ill-health compelled him to withdraw after two years. He resumed his
  medical studies, and then obtained an appointment as surgeon in the navy.
  In 1799 he proceeded to Paris, wherein 1803 he graduated as M.D. In 1805
  he again joined the army in a professional capacity, and served in
  Germany and Holland. Returning to Paris in 1808 he published his
  <i>Histoire des phlegmasies ou inflammations chroniques</i>; then left
  again for active service in Spain. In 1814 he returned to Paris, and was
  appointed assistant-professor to the military hospital of the
  Val-de-Grace, where he first promulgated his peculiar doctrines on the
  relation between "life" and "stimulus," and on the physiological
  interdependence and sympathies of the various organs. His lectures were
  attended by great numbers of students, who received with the utmost
  enthusiasm the new theories which he propounded. In 1816 he published his
  <i>Examen de la doctrine médicale généralement adoptée</i>, which drew
  down upon its author the hatred of the whole medical faculty of Paris;
  but by degrees his doctrines triumphed, and in 1831 he was appointed
  professor of general pathology in the academy of medicine. In 1828 he
  published a work <i>De l'irritation et de la folie</i>, and towards the
  end of his life he attracted large audiences by his lectures on
  phrenology. He died at Vitry-sur-Seine on the 17th of November 1838.</p>

  <p><b>BROUSSONET, PIERRE MARIE AUGUSTE</b> (1761-1807), French
  naturalist, was born at Montpellier on the 28th of February 1761, and was
  educated for the medical profession. Visiting England, he was admitted in
  1872 an honorary member of the Royal Society, and in the same year
  published at London the first part of his work on fishes,
  <i>Ichthyologiae Decas I</i>, material for which was communicated to him
  by Sir Joseph Banks. On his return to Paris he was appointed perpetual
  secretary to the Society of Agriculture, and in 1789 became a member of
  the National Assembly. Under the convention he had to leave Paris, and
  after some dangers he made his way to Madrid. The enmity of the French
  emigrants, however, drove him from Spain, and afterwards from Lisbon, but
  at last he found a refuge in Morocco as physician to an embassy sent out
  by the United States. Later he obtained permission from the Directory to
  return to France, and in 1805 was appointed professor of botany at
  Montpellier, where he died on the 17th of January 1807.</p>

  <p><b>BROUWER,</b> or <span class="sc">Brauwer</span>, <b>ADRIAN</b>
  (1608-1640), Dutch painter, was born at Haarlem, of very humble parents,
  who bound him apprentice to the painter Frans Hals. Brouwer had an
  admirable eye for colour, and much spirit in design; and these gifts his
  master appears to have turned to his own profit, while his pupil was half
  starved. As the result of this ungenerous <!-- Page 657 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page657"></a>[v.04 p.0657]</span>treatment,
  Brouwer was frequently brought into low company and dissipated scenes,
  which he delineated with great spirit and vivid colouring in his
  pictures. The unfortunate artist died in a hospital at Antwerp at the
  early age of thirty-two, consequently his works are few and rarely met
  with. The largest collection of his masterpieces is in the Pinakothek at
  Munich.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, CHARLES BROCKDEN</b> (1771-1810), American novelist, was
  born of Quaker parents in Philadelphia, on the 17th of January 1771. Of
  delicate constitution and retiring habits, he early devoted himself to
  study; his principal amusement was the invention of ideal architectural
  designs, devised on the most extensive and elaborate scale. This
  characteristic talent for construction subsequently assumed the shape of
  Utopian projects for perfect commonwealths, and at a later period of a
  series of novels distinguished by the ingenuity and consistent evolution
  of the plot. The transition between these intellectual phases is marked
  by a juvenile romance entitled <i>Carsol</i>, not published until after
  the author's death, which professes to depict an imaginary community, and
  shows how thoroughly the young American was inspired by Godwin and Mary
  Wollstonecraft, whose principal writings had recently made their
  appearance. From the latter he derived the idea of his next work, <i>The
  Dialogue of Alcuin</i> (1797), an enthusiastic but inexperienced essay on
  the question of woman's rights and liberties. From Godwin he learned his
  terse style, condensed to a fault, but too laconic for eloquence or
  modulation, and the art of developing a plot from a single psychological
  problem or mysterious circumstance. The novels which he now rapidly
  produced offer the strongest affinity to <i>Caleb Williams</i>, and if
  inferior to that remarkable work in subtlety of mental analysis, greatly
  surpass it in affluence of invention and intensity of poetical feeling.
  All are wild and weird in conception, with incidents bordering on the
  preternatural, yet the limit of possibility is never transgressed. In
  <i>Wieland; or the Transformation</i> (1798), the first and most
  striking, a seemingly inexplicable mystery is resolved into a case of
  ventriloquism. <i>Arthur Mervyn; or Memoirs of the Year 1793</i>
  (1798-1800), is remarkable for the description of the epidemic of yellow
  fever in Philadelphia. <i>Edgar Huntly</i> (Philadelphia, 1801), a
  romance rich in local colouring, is remarkable for the effective use made
  of somnambulism, and anticipates Cooper's introduction of the American
  Indian into fiction. <i>Ormond</i> (1799) is less powerful, but contains
  one character, Constantia Dudley, which excited the enthusiastic
  admiration of Shelley. Two subsequent novels, <i>Clara Howard</i> (1801)
  and <i>Jane Talbot</i> (1804), dealing with ordinary life, proved
  failures, and Brown betook himself to compiling a general system of
  geography, editing a periodical, and an annual register, and writing
  political pamphlets. He died of consumption on the 22nd of February 1810.
  He is depicted by his biographer as the purest and most amiable of men,
  and in spite of a certain formality, due perhaps to his Quaker education,
  the statement is borne out by his correspondence.</p>

  <p>The life of Charles Brockden Brown was written by his friend William
  Dunlap (Philadelphia, 1815). See also William H. Prescott,
  <i>Biographical and Critical Miscellanies</i> (New York, 1845). His works
  in 6 vols. were published at Philadelphia in 1857 with a "life," and in a
  limited and more elaborate edition (1887).</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, FORD MADOX</b> (1821-1893), English painter, was born at
  Calais on the 16th of April 1821. His father was Ford Brown, a retired
  purser in the navy; his mother, Caroline Madox, of an old Kentish family.
  His paternal grandfather was Dr John Brown, who established the Brunonian
  Theory of Medicine. Ford Madox Brown was the only child of his parents,
  save for a daughter who died young. In childhood he was shifted about a
  good deal between France and England; and having shown from the age of
  six or seven a turn for drawing he was taken, when fourteen years old,
  and with meagre acquirements in the way of general tuition, to Bruges,
  and placed under the instruction of Gregorius, a pupil of David. His
  principal instructor, however, from about 1837, was Baron Wappers, of
  Antwerp, then regarded as a great light of the Belgian school. From him
  the youth learned the technique not only of oil painting but of various
  other branches of art. At a very early age Brown attained a remarkable
  degree of force in drawing and painting, as attested by an extant
  oil-portrait of his father, done at an age not exceeding fifteen. His
  first composition, towards 1836, represented a blind beggar and his
  child; his first exhibited work, 1837, was "Job on the Ash-heap"; the
  first exhibited work in London (at the Royal Academy, 1840), "The
  Giaour's Confession," from Byron's poem. Both his parents died before
  1840, leaving to the young painter a moderate competence, which soon was
  materially reduced. In 1840 Brown completed a large picture, "The
  Execution of Mary, queen of Scots," strong in dramatic effect and in
  handling, with rather sombre colour; from this time forth he must be
  regarded as a proficient artist, independent in his point of view and
  strenuous in execution. He contributed to the cartoon competitions, 1844
  and 1845, for the Houses of Parliament&mdash;"Adam and Eve after the
  Fall," "The Body of Harold brought to William the Conqueror," and "The
  Spirit of Justice." These highly remarkable cartoons passed not wholly
  unobserved, but not one of them obtained a prize. The years 1840 to 1845
  were passed in Paris, London and Rome: towards the middle of 1846 Brown
  settled permanently in London. In 1841 he had married his cousin
  Elizabeth Bromley, who died of consumption in 1846, leaving a daughter,
  Lucy, who in 1874 became the wife of William M. Rossetti. Not long after
  being left a widower, Brown took a second wife, Emma Hill, who figures in
  many of his pictures. She had two children who grew up: Catherine, who
  married Dr Franz Hueffer, the musical scholar and critic, and Oliver, who
  died in 1874 in his twentieth year. All three children showed
  considerable ability in painting, and Oliver in romance as well. The
  second Mrs Brown died in 1890.</p>

  <p>The most marked distinction of Brown as an artist may be defined as
  vigorous invention of historic or dramatic scenes, carried out with a
  great regard to individuality in the personages, expressions and
  accessories of incident and detail, not excluding the familiar, the
  peculiar and the semi-grotesque, when these seem to subserve the general
  intent. Owing, however, to his association with artists of the so-called
  "pre-Raphaelite" movement (which began late in 1848), and especially with
  Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who received some training in his studio in the
  spring of that year, he has been regarded sometimes as the precursor or
  initiator of this movement, and sometimes as a direct co-operator in it.
  His claim to be regarded as a precursor or initiator is not strong;
  though it is true that even before 1841 he had pondered the theory (not
  then much in vogue) that a picture ought to present the veritable light
  and shade proper to some one moment in the day, and his "Manfred on the
  Jungfrau" (1841) exemplifies this principle to some extent; it reappears
  in his very large picture of "Chaucer at the Court of Edward III." (now
  in the public gallery of Sydney, Australia), which, although projected in
  1845, was not brought to completion until 1851. As to becoming a direct
  co-operator in the pre-Raphaelite movement, he did not join the
  "Brotherhood," though it would have been open to him to do so; but for
  some years his works exhibited a marked influence derived from the
  movement, not on the whole to their clear advantage. The principal
  pictures of this class are: "The Pretty Baa-lambs"; "Work" (a street
  scene at Hampstead); and "The Last of England" (an emigration subject,
  one of his most excellent achievements): dating between 1851 and 1863.
  "Christ Washing Peter's Feet" (now in the National Gallery of British
  Art) comes within the same range of dates, and is a masterly work; here
  the pre-Raphaelite influence is less manifest. Altogether it may be
  averred that the conception and introduction of the pre-Raphaelite
  scheme, such as it appeared to the public eye in 1849 and 1850, belong to
  Millais, Holman Hunt and Rossetti, rather than to Brown.</p>

  <p>Other leading pictures by Brown are the following:&mdash;"Cordelia at
  the Bedside of Lear"; "Shakespeare"; "Jacob and Joseph's Coat"; "Elijah
  and the Widow's Son"; "Cordelia's Portion"; "The Entombment"; "Romeo and
  Juliet" (the parting on the balcony); "Don Juan and Haidee"; "Cromwell on
  his Farm"; "Cromwell, Protector of the <!-- Page 658 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page658"></a>[v.04
  p.0658]</span>Vaudois":&mdash;covering the period from 1849 to 1877.
  "Sardanapalus and Myrrha," begun within the same period, was finished
  later. He produced, moreover, a great number of excellent cartoons for
  stained glass, being up to 1874 a member of the firm of decorative art,
  Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. He also executed, in colours or in
  crayons, various portraits, including his own. From 1878 he was almost
  engrossed by work which he undertook for the town hall of Manchester, and
  which entailed his living for some few years in that city&mdash;twelve
  large wall paintings, some of them done in a modified form of the
  Gambier-Parry process, and others in oils on canvas applied to the wall
  surface. They present a compendium of the history of Manchester and its
  district, from the building of the Roman camp at Mancunium to the
  experimental work of Dalton in elaborating the atomic theory. This is an
  extremely fine series, though with some diversity of individual merit in
  the paintings, and is certainly the chief representative, in the United
  Kingdom, of any such form of artistic effort&mdash;if we leave out of
  count the works (by various painters) in the Houses of Parliament.</p>

  <p>Madox Brown was never a popular or highly remunerated artist. Up to
  near middle age he went through trying straits in money matters;
  afterwards his circumstances improved, but he was not really well off at
  any time. In youth he followed the usual course as an exhibiting painter,
  but after some mortifications and heart-burnings he did little in this
  way after 1852. He held, however, in 1865, an exhibition of his own then
  numerous paintings and designs. He also delivered a few lectures on fine
  art from time to time. From 1868 he suffered from gout; and this led to
  an attack of apoplexy, from which he died in London on the 6th of October
  1893. He was a man of upright, independent and honourable character, of
  warm affections, a steady and self-sacrificing friend; but he took
  offence rather readily, and viewed various persons and institutions with
  a degree of suspicion which may be pronounced excessive. He felt interest
  in many questions outside the range of his art, and, being a good and
  varied talker, had often something apposite and suggestive to say about
  them. On more than one occasion he exerted himself very zealously for the
  benefit of the working classes. In politics he was a consistent Democrat,
  and on religious questions an Agnostic.</p>

  <p>The life of this artist has been well written by his grandson, Ford M.
  Hueffer, in a handsomely illustrated volume entitled <i>Ford Madox
  Brown</i> (London, 1896). This volume contains some extracts from Brown's
  diary, extending in the whole from 1847 to 1865; and other lengthier
  extracts appear in two books edited by William M.
  Rossetti&mdash;<i>Ruskin, Rossetti, Pre-Raphaelitism</i> (1899), and
  <i>Pre-Raphaelite Diaries and Letters</i> (1899). See also the
  <i>Preferences in Art, &amp;c.</i>, by Harry Quilter (1892), and a
  pamphlet, <i>Ford Madox Brown</i> (1901), by Helen Rossetti (Angeli),
  applicable to a collection of his works exhibited in the Whitechapel Art
  Gallery.</p>

  Hanover, New Hampshire, on the 26th of December 1849, the son of Samuel
  Gilman Brown (1813-1885), president of Hamilton College from 1867 to
  1881, and the grandson of Francis Brown (1784-1820), whose removal from
  the presidency of Dartmouth College and later restoration were incidental
  to the famous "Dartmouth College case." The younger Francis graduated
  from Dartmouth in 1870 and from the Union Theological Seminary in 1877,
  and then studied in Berlin. In 1879 he became instructor in biblical
  philology at the Union Theological Seminary, in 1881 an associate
  professor of the same subject, and in 1890 professor of Hebrew and
  cognate languages.<a name="FnAnchor_171"

  <p><b>BROWN, SIR GEORGE</b> (1790-1865), British soldier, was born and
  educated in Elgin, Scotland. He obtained a commission in the 43rd (now
  1st Bn. Oxfordshire) Light Infantry in 1806, was promoted lieutenant a
  few months later, and saw active service for the first time in the
  Mediterranean and at Copenhagen, 1806 and 1807. The 43rd was one of the
  earliest arrivals in Spain when the Peninsular War broke out, and Brown
  was with his regiment at Vimeiro, and in the Corunna retreat. Later in
  1809 the famous Light Division was formed, and with Craufurd he was
  present at all the actions of 1810-1811, being severely wounded at
  Talavera; he was then promoted captain and attended the Staff College at
  Great Marlow until (late in 1812) he returned to the Peninsula as a
  captain in the 85th. With this regiment he served under Major-General
  Lord Aylmer at the Nivelle and Nive, his conduct winning for him the rank
  of major. The 85th was next employed under General Robert Ross in
  America, and Brown, who received a severe wound at the action of
  Bladensburg, was promoted to a lieut.-colonelcy. At the age of
  twenty-five, with a brilliant war record, he received an appointment at
  the Horse Guards, and remained in London for over twenty-five years in
  various staff positions. He was made a colonel and K.H. in 1831, and by
  1852 had arrived at the rank of lieut.-general and the dignity of K.C.B.
  At this time he was adjutant-general, but on the appointment of Lord
  Hardinge to the post of commander-in-chief, Brown left the Horse Guards.
  In 1854, on the despatch of a British force to the East, Sir George Brown
  was appointed to command the Light Division. This he led in action, and
  administered in camp, on Peninsular principles, and, whilst preserving
  the strictest discipline to a degree which came in for criticism, he made
  himself beloved by his men. At Alma he had a horse shot under him. At
  Inkerman he was wounded whilst leading the French Zouaves into action. In
  the following year, when an expedition against Kertch and the Russian
  communications was decided upon, Brown went in command of the British
  contingent. He was invalided home on the day of Lord Raglan's death. From
  March 1860 to March 1865 he was commander-in-chief in Ireland. At the
  time of his death in 1865 he was general and G.C.B., colonel of the 32nd
  Regiment and colonel-in-chief of the Rifle Brigade.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, GEORGE</b> (1818-1880), Canadian journalist and statesman,
  was born in Edinburgh on the 29th of November 1818, and was educated in
  his native city. With his father, Peter Brown (d. 1863), he emigrated to
  New York in 1838; and in 1843 they removed to Toronto, and began the
  publication of <i>The Banner</i>, a politico-religious paper in support
  of the newly formed Free Church of Scotland. In 1844 he began,
  independently of his father, the issue of the Toronto <i>Globe</i>. This
  paper, at first weekly, became in 1853 a daily, and through the ability
  and energy of Brown, came to possess an almost tyrannical influence over
  the political opinion of Ontario. In 1851 he entered the Canadian
  parliament as member for Kent county. Though giving at first a modified
  support to the Reform government, he soon broke with it and became leader
  of the Radical or "Clear Grit" party. His attacks upon the Roman Catholic
  church and on the supposed domination in parliament of the French
  Canadian section made him very unpopular in Lower Canada, but in Upper
  Canada his power was great. Largely owing to his attacks, the Clergy
  Reserves were secularized in 1854. He championed the complete laicization
  of the schools in Ontario, but unsuccessfully, the Roman Catholic church
  maintaining its right to separate schools. He also fought for the
  representation by population of the two provinces in parliament, the Act
  of Union (1841) having granted an equal number of representatives to
  each. This principle of "Rep. by Pop." was conceded by the British North
  America Act (1867). In 1858 Brown became premier of "The Short
  Administration," which was defeated and compelled to resign after an
  existence of two days.</p>

  <p>He was one of the earliest advocates of a federation of the British
  colonies in North America, and in 1864, to accomplish this end, entered
  into a coalition with his bitter personal and political opponent, Mr
  (afterwards Sir) John A. Macdonald. <!-- Page 659 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page659"></a>[v.04 p.0659]</span>Largely owing
  to Brown's efforts, Federation was carried through the House, but on the
  21st of December 1865 he resigned from the Coalition government, though
  continuing to support its Federation policy, and in 1867 he was defeated
  in South Ontario and never again sat in the House. In great measure owing
  to his energy, and in spite of much concealed opposition from the
  French-Canadians, the North-West Territories were purchased by the new
  Dominion. In December 1873 he was called to the Canadian senate, and in
  1874 was appointed by the imperial government joint plenipotentiary with
  Sir Edward Thornton to negotiate a reciprocity treaty between Canada and
  the United States. The negotiations were successful, but the draft treaty
  failed to pass the United States Senate. Soon afterwards Brown refused
  the lieutenant-governorship of Ontario, and on two subsequent occasions
  the offer of knighthood, devoting himself to the <i>Globe</i> and to a
  model farm at Bow Park near Brantford. On the 25th of March 1880 he was
  shot by a discharged employé, and died on the 9th of May.</p>

  <p>His candour, enthusiasm and open tolerance of the opinions of others
  made him many warm friends and many fierce enemies. He was at his best in
  his generous protests against all privileges, social, political and
  religious, and in the self-sacrificing patriotism which enabled him to
  fling aside his personal prejudices, and so to make Federation
  possible.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, HENRY KIRKE</b> (1814-1886), American sculptor, was born in
  Leyden, Massachusetts, on the 24th of February 1814. He began to paint
  portraits while quite a boy, studied painting in Boston under Chester
  Harding, learned a little about modelling, and in 1836-1839 spent his
  summers working as a railroad engineer to earn enough to enable him to
  study further. He spent four years (1842-1846) in Italy; but returning to
  New York he remained distinctively American, and was never dominated, as
  were so many of the early American sculptors, by Italian influence. He
  died on the 10th of July 1886 at Newburgh, New York. His equestrian
  statues are excellent, notably that of General Winfield Scott (1874) in
  Washington, D.C., and one of George Washington (1856) in Union Square,
  New York City, which was the second equestrian statue made in the United
  States, following by three years that of Andrew Jackson in Washington by
  Clark Mills (1815-1883). Brown was one of the first in America to cast
  his own bronzes. Among his other works are: Abraham Lincoln (Union
  Square, New York City); Nathanael Greene, George Clinton, Philip Kearny,
  and Richard Stockton (all in the National Statuary Hall, Capitol,
  Washington, D.C.); De Witt Clinton and "The Angel of the Resurrection,"
  both in Greenwood cemetery, New York City; and an "Aboriginal
  Hunter."</p>

  <p>His nephew and pupil, Henry Kirke Bush-Brown (b. 1857), also became
  prominent among American sculptors, his "Buffalo Hunt," equestrian
  statues of Generals Meade and Reynolds at Gettysburg, and "Justinian" in
  the New York appellate court-house, being his chief works.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JACOB</b> (1775-1828), American soldier, was born of Quaker
  ancestry, in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, on the 9th of May 1775. From
  1796 to 1798 he was engaged in surveying public lands in Ohio; in 1798 he
  settled in New York City, and during the period (1798-1800) when war with
  France seemed imminent he acted as military secretary to Alexander
  Hamilton, then inspector-general of the United States army. Subsequently
  he purchased a large tract of land in Jefferson county, New York, where
  he founded the town of Brownville. There he served as county judge, and
  attained the rank (1810) of brigadier-general in the state militia. On
  the outbreak of the second war with Great Britain (1812) he was placed in
  command of the New York state frontier from Oswego to Lake St Francis
  (near Cornwall, Ontario) and repelled the British attacks on Ogdensburg
  (October 4, 1812) and Sackett's Harbor (May 29, 1813). In July 1813 he
  was commissioned brigadier-general in the regular army, and in January
  1814 he was promoted major-general and succeeded General James Wilkinson
  in command of the forces at Niagara. Early in the summer of 1814 he
  undertook offensive operations, and his forces occupied Fort Erie, and,
  on the 5th of July, at Chippawa, Ontario, defeated the British under
  General Phineas Riall (c. 1769-1851). On the 25th of July, with General
  Winfield Scott, he fought a hotly contested, but indecisive, battle with
  the British under General Gordon Drummond (1771-1854) at Lundy's Lane,
  where he was twice wounded. After the war he remained in the army, of
  which he was the commanding general from March 1821 until his death at
  Washington, D.C., on the 24th of February 1828.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN</b> (1715-1766), British divine and author, was born at
  Rothbury, Northumberland, on the 5th of November 1715. His father, a
  descendant of the Browns of Coalston, near Haddington, became vicar of
  Wigton in that year. Young Brown was educated at St John's College,
  Cambridge; and after graduating at the head of the list of wranglers in
  1735, he took holy orders, and was appointed minor canon and lecturer at
  Carlisle. In 1745 he distinguished himself in the defence of Carlisle as
  a volunteer, and in 1747 was appointed chaplain to Dr Osbaldiston, on his
  admission to the bishopric of Carlisle. His poem, entitled "Honour"
  (1743), was followed by the "Essay on Satire." This gained for him the
  friendship of William Warburton, who introduced him to Ralph Allen, of
  Prior Park, near Bath. In 1751 Brown dedicated to Allen his <i>Essay on
  the Characteristics of Lord Shaftesbury</i>, containing an able defence
  of the utilitarian philosophy, praised later by John Stuart Mill
  (<i>Westminster Review</i>, vol. xxix. p. 477). In 1756 he was promoted
  by the earl of Hardwicke to the living of Great Horkesley in Essex, and
  in the following year he took the degree of D.D. at Cambridge. He was the
  author of two plays, <i>Barbarossa</i> (1754) and <i>Athelstane</i>
  (1756); Garrick played in both, and the first was a success. The most
  popular of his works was the <i>Estimate of the Manners and Principles of
  the Times</i> (2 vols., 1757-1758), a bitter satire which pleased a
  public depressed by the ill-success in the conduct of the war, and ready
  to welcome an attack on luxury and kindred evils. Other works are the
  <i>Additional Dialogue of the Dead between Pericles and Cosmo ...</i>
  (1760), in vindication of Chatham's policy; and the <i>Dissertation on
  the Rise, Union and Power, &amp;c., of Poetry and Music</i> (1763). He
  was consulted in connexion with a scheme of education which Catherine II.
  of Russia desired to introduce into her dominions. A memorandum on the
  subject by Dr Brown led to an offer on her part to entertain him at St
  Petersburg as her adviser on the subject. He had bought a postchaise and
  various other things for the journey, when he was persuaded to relinquish
  the design on account of his gout. He had been subject to fits of
  melancholy, and, influenced perhaps by disappointment, he committed
  suicide on the 23rd of September 1766.</p>

  <p>There is a detailed account of John Brown by Andrew Kippis in
  <i>Biographia Britannica</i> (1780), containing the text of the
  negotiations for his journey to Russia, and of a long letter in which he
  outlines the principles of the scheme he would have proposed. See also T.
  Davies, <i>Memoirs of ... David Garrick</i> (1780), chap. xix.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN</b> (1722-1787), Scottish divine, was born at Carpow,
  in Perthshire. He was almost entirely self-educated, having acquired a
  knowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew while employed as a shepherd. His
  early career was varied, and he was in succession a packman, a soldier in
  the Edinburgh garrison in 1745, and a school-master. He was, from 1750
  till his death, minister of the Burgher branch of the Secession church
  (see <span class="sc">United Presbyterian Church</span>) in Haddington.
  From 1786 he was professor of divinity for his denomination, and was
  mainly responsible for the training of its ministry. He gained a just
  reputation for learning and piety. The best of his many works are his
  <i>Self-Interpreting Bible</i> and <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, works
  that were long very popular. The former was translated into Welsh. He
  also wrote an <i>Explication of the Westminster Confession</i>, and a
  number of biographical and historical sketches.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN</b> (1735-1788), Scottish physician, was born in 1735
  at Lintlaws or at Preston, Berwickshire. After attending the parish
  school at Duns, he went to Edinburgh and entered <!-- Page 660 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page660"></a>[v.04 p.0660]</span>the divinity
  classes at the university, supporting himself by private tuition. In 1759
  he seems to have discontinued his theological studies, and to have begun
  the study of medicine. He soon attracted the notice of William Cullen,
  who engaged him as private tutor to his family, and treated him in some
  respects as an assistant professor. In time, however, he quarrelled with
  Cullen, as with the professors of the university in general, and from
  about 1778 his public lectures contained vigorous attacks on all
  preceding systems of medicine and Cullen's in particular. In 1780 he
  published his <i>Elementa Medicinae</i>, expounding his own, or as it was
  then called the Brunonian, theory of medicine, which for a time had a
  great vogue. In 1786 he set out for London in the vain hope of bettering
  his fortunes, and died there of apoplexy on the 17th of October 1788.</p>

  <p>An edition of his works, with notice of his life by his son, William
  Cullen Brown, appeared in 1804.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN</b> (1784-1858), Scottish divine, grandson of the
  last-named, was born at Whitburn, Linlithgowshire, on the 12th of July
  1784. He studied at Glasgow university, and afterwards at the divinity
  hall of the "Burgher" branch of the "Secession" church at Selkirk, under
  the celebrated George Lawson. In 1806 he was ordained minister of the
  Burgher congregation at Biggar, Lanarkshire, where he laboured for
  sixteen years. While there he had an interesting controversy with Robert
  Owen the socialist. Transferred in 1822 to the charge of Rose Street
  church, Edinburgh, he at once took a high rank as a preacher. In 1829 he
  succeeded James Hall at Broughton Place church, Edinburgh. In 1835 he was
  appointed one of the professors in the theological hall of the Secession
  church, and, great as was his ability as a preacher and pastor, it was
  probably in this sphere that he rendered his most valuable service. He
  had been the first in Scotland to use in the pulpit the exegetical method
  of exposition of Scripture, and as a professor he illustrated the method
  and extended its use. To him chiefly is due the abandonment of the
  principle of interpretation according to the "analogy of faith," which
  practically subordinated the Bible to the creed. Brown's exegesis was
  marked by rare critical sagacity, exact and extensive scholarship,
  unswerving honesty, and a clear, logical style; and his expository works
  have thus a permanent value. He had a considerable share in the Apocrypha
  controversy, and he was throughout life a vigorous and consistent
  upholder of anti-state-church or "voluntary" views. His two sermons on
  <i>The Law of Christ respecting civil obedience, especially in the
  payment of tribute</i>, called forth by a local grievance from which he
  had personally suffered, were afterwards published with extensive
  additions and notes, and are still regarded as an admirable statement and
  defence of the voluntary principle. The part he took in the discussion on
  the Atonement, which agitated all the Scottish churches, led to a formal
  charge of heresy against him by those who held the doctrine of a limited
  atonement. In 1845, after a protracted trial, he was acquitted by the
  synod. From that time he enjoyed the thorough confidence of his
  denomination (after 1847 merged in "the United Presbyterian church"), of
  which in his later years he was generally regarded as the leading
  representative. He died on the 13th of October 1858. His chief works
  were: <i>Expository Discourses on First Peter</i> (1848); <i>Exposition
  of the Discourses and Sayings of our Lord</i> (1850); <i>Exposition of
  our Lord's Intercessory Prayer</i> (1850); <i>The Resurrection of
  Life</i> (1851); <i>Expository Discourses on Galatians</i> (1853); and
  <i>Analytical Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans</i> (1857).</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN</b> (1800-1859), American abolitionist, leader of the
  famous attack upon Harper's Ferry, in 1859, was born on the 9th of May
  1800, at Torrington, Connecticut. He is said to have been descended from
  Peter Brown, who went to America in the <i>Mayflower</i>, and he was the
  grandson of Captain John Brown, who served in the War of Independence. He
  was taken by his father, Owen Brown, to Hudson, Ohio, in 1805. At the age
  of eighteen he began to prepare himself for the Congregational ministry,
  but soon changed his mind and turned his attention to land surveying. He
  engaged successively in the tanning business, in sheep-raising, and in
  the wool trade, but met with little success and in 1842, at Akron, Ohio,
  became bankrupt. In 1849, after having lived in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
  Massachusetts, he removed to North Elba, N.Y., where he engaged in
  farming on part of the land which was being given in small tracts, by its
  owner Gerrit Smith, to negro settlers. Long before this he had conceived
  a strong hatred for the institution of slavery, and had determined to do
  what he could to bring about its destruction. In 1854 five of his sons
  removed to Kansas, where the violent conflict was beginning between the
  "free-state" and the pro-slavery settlers, and in the following year
  Brown, leaving the rest of his family at North Elba, joined them,
  settling near Osawatomie and immediately becoming a conspicuous figure in
  the border warfare. His name became particularly well known in connexion
  with the so-called "Pottawatomie massacre," the killing in cold blood, on
  the 25th of May 1856, by men under his orders, of five pro-slavery
  settlers in retaliation for the murder a short time previously of five
  "free-state" settlers. He also on the 2nd of June, at the head of about
  thirty men, captured Captain H. C. Pate and twenty-two pro-slavery men at
  Black Jack, and on the 30th of August 1856, with a small body of
  supporters, vigorously resisted an attack of a superior pro-slavery force
  upon Osawatomie. Brown then visited the Eastern states for the purpose of
  raising money to be used in the Kansas struggle and of arousing the
  people against slavery. After spending a short time in Kansas, in
  1858-1859 he proceeded to carry out a long-cherished scheme for
  facilitating the escape of fugitive slaves by establishing in the
  mountains of Virginia a stronghold in which such fugitives could take
  refuge and defend themselves against their pursuers. At Chatham, Canada,
  with eleven white and thirty-five negro associates, he adopted a
  "Provisional Constitution and Ordinance for the People of the United
  States." Brown was elected commander-in-chief, and from among this group
  a secretary of state, a secretary of war, a secretary of the treasury,
  and members of Congress were chosen. Later, with only twenty-two men
  supplied with arms furnished by the Massachusetts-Kansas committee, and
  with funds contributed (in ignorance of Brown's plans) by his intimate
  associates, Theodore Parker, George L. Stearns, T. W. Higginson, and F.
  B. Sanborn, all of Boston, and Gerrit Smith, of Peterboro, New York, he
  removed to a farm near Harper's Ferry, the site of a Federal arsenal,
  which he intended to capture as a preliminary to the carrying out of the
  main part of his plan. On the night of the 16th of October 1859, with
  only eighteen men, five of whom were negroes, he made the attack, easily
  capturing the arsenal and taking about sixty of the leading citizens
  prisoners to be used as hostages. On the following morning Brown and his
  followers were vigorously attacked, and on the 18th&mdash;a small force
  of United States marines under Colonel Robert E. Lee having
  arrived&mdash;were overpowered, Brown being seriously wounded after he
  had surrendered. Of the twenty-two men who had participated in the raid,
  ten were killed, seven were taken prisoners, and five escaped. On the
  other side five were killed and nine wounded. Brown was committed to the
  Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia), gaol on the 19th of October;
  on the 27th his trial began; on the 31st he was convicted of "treason,
  and conspiring and advising with slaves and other rebels, and murder in
  the first degree"; and on the 2nd of December he was hanged at
  Charlestown. His fellow-prisoners were likewise hanged soon afterwards.
  Brown was buried at North Elba, New York. The attack upon Harper's Ferry
  created widespread excitement, particularly in the Southern states; and
  among the abolitionists in the North Brown was looked upon as a martyr to
  their cause. Shortly after his death a famous popular song became widely
  current in the North, beginning:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,</p>
      <p>But his soul goes marching on.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Intensely religious in his nature, Brown possessed something of the
  gloomy fanaticism of his Puritan ancestors. The secret of his whole
  career lies in his emphatic conviction, to use the <!-- Page 661 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page661"></a>[v.04 p.0661]</span>words of
  Wendell Phillips, that he had "letters of marque from God"; that he had a
  divine commission to destroy slavery by violent means. He scouted the
  "milk and water principles" of the milder abolitionists, advocated
  vigorous resistance to the slave power, and expressed his ideas by
  actions rather than by words. It now seems that this policy aided very
  little in making Kansas a free state, and that the attack on Harper's
  Ferry, while creating much feeling at the moment, had very little effect
  on the subsequent course of events. It is safe to assume that secession
  and civil war would have followed the election of Lincoln if there had
  been no such raid into Virginia.</p>

  <p>Brown was twice married and was the father of twenty children, eight
  of whom died in early childhood. His sons aided him in all his
  undertakings, two of them being killed at Harper's Ferry; and Owen Brown,
  who died in 1889, was long the only survivor of the attack.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN</b> (1810-1882), Scottish physician and author, son of
  John Brown (1784-1858), was born at Biggar, Scotland, on the 22nd of
  September 1810. He graduated as M.D. at the university of Edinburgh in
  1833, and practised as a physician in that city. His reputation, however,
  is based on the two volumes of essays, <i>Horae Subsecivae</i> (i.e.
  "leisure hours") (1858, 1861), <i>John Leech and other Papers</i> (1882),
  <i>Rab and His Friends</i> (1859), and <i>Marjorie Fleming: a Sketch</i>
  (1863). The first volume of <i>Horae Subsecivae</i> deals chiefly with
  the equipment and duties of a physician, the second with subjects outside
  his profession. He was emphatic in his belief that an author should
  publish nothing "unless he has something to say, and has done his best to
  say it aright." Acting on this principle, he published little himself,
  and only after subjecting it to the severest criticism. His work is
  invariably characterized by humour and tenderness. He suffered during the
  latter years of his life from pronounced attacks of melancholy, and died
  on the 11th of May 1882.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, SIR JOHN</b> (1816-1896), English armour plate manufacturer,
  was born at Sheffield on the 6th of December 1816, the son of a slater.
  He was apprenticed when fourteen years old to a Sheffield firm who
  manufactured files and table cutlery. Impressed with Brown's ability, the
  senior partner offered him the control of the business (Earl Horton and
  Co.) and advanced some of the necessary capital. Brown invented in 1848
  the conical steel spring buffer for railway wagons, and in 1860, after
  seeing the French ship "La Gloire" armoured with hammered plate, he
  determined to attempt the production of armour for the British navy by a
  rolling process. The experiment was successful, and led to admiralty
  orders for armour plate sufficient to protect about three-quarters of the
  navy. In 1856 Brown had started the Atlas Works in Sheffield, which soon
  produced, beside armour plates and railway buffers, ordnance forgings,
  steel rails, railway carriage axles and tires. The works covered thirty
  acres and employed eventually more than four thousand workmen. Besides
  supplying iron to the Sheffield steel trade, Brown himself successfully
  developed the Bessemer process. In 1864, after his business had been
  converted into a limited company, he retired. He died at Bromley, Kent,
  on the 27th of December 1896. Among the honours conferred upon him was a
  knighthood in 1867, the office of mayor of Sheffield in 1862 and 1863,
  and that of Master Cutler in 1865 and 1866.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, JOHN GEORGE</b> (1831- ), American painter, was born in
  Durham, England, on the 11th of November 1831. He studied at
  Newcastle-on-Tyne, in the Edinburgh Academy, and after removing to New
  York City in 1853, at the schools of the National Academy of Design of
  which he afterwards became a member. In 1866 he became one of the charter
  members of the Water-Colour Society, of which he was president from 1887
  to 1904. He generally confined himself to representations of street child
  life, bootblacks, newsboys, &amp;c. ; his "Passing Show" (Paris, Salon,
  1877) and "Street Boys at Play" (Paris Exhibition, 1900) are good
  examples of his popular talent.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, ROBERT</b> (1773-1858), British botanist, was born on the
  21st of December 1773 at Montrose, and was educated at the grammar school
  of his native town, where he had as contemporaries Joseph Hume and James
  Mill. In 1787 he entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, but two years
  afterwards removed to Edinburgh University, where his taste for botany
  attracted the attention of John Walker (1731-1803), then professor of
  natural history in the university. In 1795 he obtained a commission in
  the Forfarshire regiment of Fencible Infantry as "ensign and assistant
  surgeon," and served in the north of Ireland. In 1798 he made the
  acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks, by whom in 1801 he was offered the post
  of naturalist to the expedition fitted out under Captain Matthew Flinders
  for the survey of the then almost unknown coasts of Australia. Ferdinand
  Bauer, afterwards familiarly associated with Brown in his botanical
  discoveries, was draughtsman; William Westall was landscape painter; and
  among the midshipmen was one afterwards destined to rise into fame as Sir
  John Franklin. In 1805 the expedition returned to England, having
  obtained, among other acquisitions, nearly 4000 species of plants, many
  of which were new. Brown was almost immediately appointed librarian of
  the Linnean Society. In this position, though one of no great emolument,
  he had abundant opportunities of pursuing his studies; but it was not
  until 1810 that he published the first volume of his great work, in
  Latin, the <i>Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van
  Diemen</i>, which did much to further the general adoption of A.L. de
  Jussieu's natural system of plant classification. Its merits were
  immediately recognized, and it gave its author an international
  reputation among botanists. It is rare in its original edition, the
  author having suppressed it, hurt at the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> having
  fallen foul of its Latinity. With the exception of a supplement published
  in 1830, no more of the work appeared. In 1810 Brown became librarian to
  Sir Joseph Banks, who on his death in 1820 bequeathed to him the use and
  enjoyment of his library and collections for life. In 1827 an arrangement
  was made by which these were transferred to the British Museum, with
  Brown's consent and in accordance with Sir Joseph's will. Brown then
  became keeper of this new botanical department, an office which he held
  until his death. Soon after Banks's decease he resigned the librarianship
  of the Linnean Society, and from 1849 to 1853 he served as its president.
  He received many honours. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1811,
  he received its Copley medal in 1839, for his "discoveries on the subject
  of vegetable impregnation," and in 1833 he was elected one of the five
  foreign associates of the Institute of France. Among his other
  distinctions was membership of the order "pour le Mérite" of Prussia. In
  the <i>Academia Caesarea Naturae Curiosorum</i> he sat under the cognomen
  of Ray. He died on the 10th of June 1858, in the house in Soho Square,
  London, bequeathed to him by Sir Joseph Banks. His works, which embrace
  not only systematic botany, but also plant anatomy and physiology, are
  distinguished by their thoroughness and conscientious accuracy, and
  display powers at once of minute detail and of broad generalization. The
  continual movements observed by the microscope among minute particles
  suspended in a liquid were noticed by him in 1827, and hence are known as
  "Brownian movements."</p>

  <p>In 1825-1834 his works up to that date were collected and published in

  <p><b>BROWN, SAMUEL MORISON</b> (1817-1856), Scottish chemist, poet and
  essayist, born at Haddington on the 23rd of February 1817, was the fourth
  son of Samuel Brown, the founder of <!-- Page 662 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page662"></a>[v.04 p.0662]</span>itinerating
  libraries, and grandson of John Brown, author of the <i>Self-Interpreting
  Bible</i>. In 1832 he entered the university of Edinburgh, where, after
  studying in Berlin and St Petersburg, he graduated as M.D. in 1839. About
  1840 he was engaged in experiments by which he sought to prove that
  "carbon in certain states of combination is susceptible of conversion
  into silicon," and his failure to establish this proposition had much to
  do with his want of success as a candidate for the chair of chemistry at
  Edinburgh in 1843. He held the doctrine that the chemical elements are
  compounds of equal and similar atoms, and might therefore possibly be all
  derived from one generic atom. In 1850 he published a tragedy, <i>Galileo
  Galilei</i>, and two volumes of his <i>Lectures on the Atomic Theory and
  Essays Scientific and Literary</i> appeared in 1858, with a preface by
  his kinsman Dr John Brown, the author of <i>Horae Subsecivae</i>. He died
  at Edinburgh on the 20th of September 1856.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, THOMAS</b> (1663-1704), English satirist, of "facetious
  memory" as Addison designates him, was the son of a farmer at Shifnal, in
  Shropshire, and was born in 1663. He was entered in 1678 at Christ
  Church, Oxford, where he is said to have escaped expulsion by the famous
  lines beginning, "I do not love thee, Dr Fell." He was for three years
  schoolmaster at Kingston-on-Thames, and afterwards settled in London.
  Under the pseudonym of Dudly Tomkinson he wrote a satire on Dryden,
  <i>The Reasons of Mr Bays changing his Religion: considered in a Dialogue
  between Crites, Eugenius and Mr Bays</i>, with two other parts having
  separate titles (1688-1690, republished with additions in 1691). He was
  the author of a great variety of poems, letters, dialogues and lampoons,
  full of humour and erudition, but coarse and scurrilous. His writings
  have a certain value for the knowledge they display of low life in
  London. He died on the 16th of June 1704, and was buried in the cloister
  of Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p>His collected works were published in 1707-1708. The second volume
  contains a collection of <i>Letters from the Dead to the Living</i>, some
  of which are translated from the French. His <i>Comical Romance done into
  English</i> (1772, the <i>Roman Comique</i> of Scarron) was reprinted in
  1892.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, THOMAS</b> (1778-1820), Scottish philosopher, was born at
  Kirkmabreck, Kirkcudbright, where his father was parish clergyman. He was
  a boy of a refined nature, a wide reader and an eager student. Educated
  at several schools in London, he went to Edinburgh University in 1792,
  where he attended Dugald Stewart's moral philosophy class. His attendance
  was desultory, and he does not appear to have completed his arts course.
  After studying law for a time he took up medicine; his graduation thesis
  <i>De Somno</i> was well received. But his great strength lay in
  metaphysical analysis, as was shown in his answer to the objections
  raised against the appointment of Sir John Leslie to the mathematical
  professorship (1805). Leslie, a follower of Hume, was attacked by the
  clerical party as a sceptic and an infidel, and Brown took the
  opportunity to defend Hume's doctrine of causality as in no way inimical
  to religion. His defence, at first only a pamphlet, became in its third
  edition a lengthy treatise entitled <i>Inquiry into the Relation of Cause
  and Effect</i>, and is a fine specimen of Brown's analytical faculty. In
  1806 he became a medical practitioner in partnership with James Gregory,
  but, though successful in his profession, preferred literature and
  philosophy. After twice failing in the attempt to gain a professorship in
  the university, he was invited, during an illness of Dugald Stewart in
  the session of 1808-1809, to act as his substitute, and during the
  following session he undertook a great part of Stewart's work. The
  students received him with enthusiasm, due partly to his splendid
  rhetoric and partly to the novelty and ingenuity of his views. In 1810 he
  was appointed as colleague to Stewart, a position which he held for the
  rest of his life. He wrote his lectures at high pressure, and devoted
  much time to the editing and publication of the numerous poems which he
  had written at various times during his life. He was also engaged in
  preparing an abstract of his lectures as a handbook for his class. His
  health, never strong, gave way under the strain of his work. He was
  advised to take a voyage to London, where he died on the 2nd of April
  1820.</p>

  <p>His friend and biographer, David Welsh (1793-1845), superintended the
  publication of his text-book, the <i>Physiology of the Human Mind</i>,
  and his <i>Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind</i> was published
  by his successors, John Stewart and the Rev. E. Milroy. The latter was
  received with great enthusiasm both in England (where it reached its 19th
  edition) and in America; but recent criticism has lessened its popularity
  and it is now almost forgotten.</p>

  <p>Brown's philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier
  Scottish school and the later analytical or associational psychology. To
  the latter Brown really belonged, but he had preserved certain doctrines
  of the older school which were out of harmony with his fundamental view.
  He still retained a small quantum of intuitive beliefs, and did not
  appear to see that the very existence of these could not be explained by
  his theory of mental action. This intermediate or wavering position
  accounts for the comparative neglect into which his works have now
  fallen. They did much to excite thinking, and advanced many problems by
  more than one step, but they did not furnish a coherent system, and the
  doctrines which were then new have since been worked out with greater
  consistency and clearness.</p>

  <p>Brown wrote a criticism of Darwin's <i>Zoonomia</i> (1798), and was
  one of the first contributors to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, in the
  second number of which he published a criticism of the Kantian
  philosophy, based entirely on Villers's French account of it. Among his
  poems, which are modelled on Pope and Akenside and rather commonplace,
  may be mentioned: <i>Paradise of Coquettes</i> (1814); <i>Wanderer in
  Norway</i> (1815); <i>Warfiend</i> (1816); <i>Bower of Spring</i> (1817);
  <i>Agnes</i> (1818); <i>Emily</i> (1819); a collected edition in 4 vols.
  appeared in 1820.</p>

  <i>Discussions</i> and <i>Lectures on Metaphysics</i>; and for a high
  estimate of his merits, see J. S. Mill's <i>Examination of Hamilton</i>.

  who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines. See <i>Die
  neue Psychologie</i>, pp. 320-330.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, THOMAS EDWARD</b> (1830-1897), British poet, scholar and
  divine, was born on the 5th of May 1830, at Douglas, Isle of Man. His
  father, the Rev. Robert Brown, held the living of St Matthew's&mdash;a
  homely church in a poor district. His mother came of Scottish parentage,
  though born in the island. Thomas, the sixth of ten children, was but two
  years old when the family removed to Kirk Braddan vicarage, a short
  distance from Douglas, where his father (a scholar of no university, but
  so fastidious about composition that he would have some sentences of an
  English classic read to him before answering an invitation) took share
  with the parish schoolmaster in tutoring the clever boy until, at the age
  of fifteen, he was entered at King William's College. Here his abilities
  soon declared themselves, and hence he proceeded to Christ Church,
  Oxford, where his position (as a servitor) cost him much humiliation,
  which he remembered to the end of his life. He won a double first,
  however, and was elected a fellow of Oriel in April 1854, Dean Gaisford
  having refused to promote him to a senior studentship of his own college,
  on the ground that no servitor had ever before attained to that honour.
  Although at that time an Oriel fellowship conferred a deserved
  distinction, Brown never took kindly to the life, but, after a few terms
  of private pupils, returned to the Isle of Man as vice-principal of his
  old school. He had been ordained deacon, but did not proceed to priest's
  orders for many years. In 1857 he married his cousin, Miss Stowell,
  daughter of Dr Stowell of Ramsey, and soon afterwards left the island
  once more to become headmaster of the Crypt school, Gloucester &mdash;a
  position which in no long time he found intolerable. From Gloucester he
  was summoned by the Rev. John Percival (afterwards bishop of Hereford),
  who had recently been appointed to the struggling young foundation of
  Clifton College, which he soon raised to be one of the great public
  schools. Percival wanted a master for the modern side, and made an
  appointment to meet Brown at Oxford; "and there," he writes, "as chance
  would have it, I met him standing at the corner of St Mary's <!-- Page
  663 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page663"></a>[v.04
  p.0663]</span>Entry, in a somewhat Johnsonian attitude, four-square, his
  hands deep in his pockets to keep himself still, and looking decidedly
  volcanic. We very soon came to terms, and I left him there under promise
  to come to Clifton as my colleague at the beginning of the following
  term." At Clifton Brown remained from September 1863 to July 1892, when
  he retired&mdash;to the great regret of boys and masters alike, who had
  long since come to regard "T.E.B.'s" genius, and even his eccentricities,
  with a peculiar pride&mdash;to spend the rest of his days upon the island
  he had worshipped from childhood and often celebrated in song. His poem
  "Betsy Lee" appeared in <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i> (April and May 1873),
  and was published separately in the same year. It was included in
  <i>Fo'c's'le Yarns</i> (1881), which reached a second edition in 1889.
  This volume included at least three other notable poems&mdash;"Tommy
  Big-eyes," "Christmas Rose," and "Captain Tom and Captain Hugh." It was
  followed by <i>The Doctor and other Poems</i> (1887), <i>The Manx Witch
  and other Poems</i> (1889), and <i>Old John and other Poems</i>&mdash;a
  volume mainly lyrical (1893). Since his death all these and a few
  additional lyrics and fragments have been published in one volume by
  Messrs Macmillan under the title of <i>The Collected Poems of T.E.
  Brown</i> (1900). His familiar letters (edited in two volumes by an old
  friend, Mr S.T. Irwin, in 1900) bear witness to the zest he carried back
  to his native country, although his thoughts often reverted to Clifton.
  In October 1897 he returned to the school on a visit. He was the guest of
  one of the house-masters, and on Friday evening, 29th October, he gave an
  address to the boys of the house. He had spoken for some minutes with his
  usual vivacity, when his voice grew thick and he was seen to stagger. He
  died in less than two hours. Brown's more important poems are narrative,
  and written in the Manx dialect, with a free use of pauses, and sometimes
  with daring irregularity of rhythm. A rugged tenderness is their most
  characteristic note; but the emotion, while almost equally explosive in
  mirth and in tears, remains an educated emotion, disciplined by a
  scholar's sense of language. They breathe the fervour of an island
  patriotism (humorously aware of its limits) and of a simple natural
  piety. In his lyrics he is happiest when yoking one or the other of these
  emotions to serve a philosophy of life, often audacious, but always
  genial.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, SIR WILLIAM,</b> <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1784-1864),
  British merchant and banker, founder of the banking-house of Brown,
  Shipley &amp; Co., was born at Ballymena, Ireland, on the 30th of May
  1784, the son of an Irish linen-merchant. At the age of sixteen he
  accompanied his father and brothers to Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.,
  whither it had been decided to transfer the family business, but in 1809
  left America for Liverpool. Here he established a branch of the firm,
  which had now begun to deal largely in raw cotton as well as linen and
  soon afterwards developed into one of general merchants and finally
  bankers. Brown became one of the leaders in Liverpool commerce, and in
  1832 took a principal share in the reform of the system of
  dock-management then in vogue at that port. The great financial crisis of
  1837 seriously threatened the ruin of the firm, but on Brown's urgent
  representations as to the multiplicity of interests involved the Bank of
  England agreed to advance him £2,000,000 to tide matters over. Actually
  Brown only found it necessary to apply for £1,000,000, which he repaid
  within six months. His business, both mercantile and banking, continued
  to increase, and in 1844 he was in possession of a sixth of the trade
  between Great Britain and the United States. "There is hardly," declared
  Richard Cobden at this period, "a wind that blows, or a tide that flows
  in the Mersey, that does not bring a ship freighted with cotton or some
  other costly commodity for Mr Brown's house." In 1856 the friction
  between the British and American governments due to the enlistment by
  British consuls of recruits for the Crimean War was largely allayed by
  the action of Brown, who in an interview with Lord Palmerston, then
  prime-minister, explained the objections taken in America. From 1846 to
  1859 he was Liberal M.P. for South Lancashire. In 1860 he presented
  Liverpool with a public library and museum, and in 1863 was made a
  baronet. He died at Liverpool in 1864.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN, WILLIAM LAURENCE</b> (1755-1830), Scottish divine, was born
  on the 7th of January 1755 at Utrecht, where his father was minister of
  the English church. The father, having been appointed professor of
  ecclesiastical history at St Andrews, returned to Scotland in 1757, and
  his son went to the grammar school of that city, and then to the
  university. After passing through the divinity classes, he went in 1774
  to the university of Utrecht, where he studied theology and civil law. In
  1777 he was appointed to the English church in Utrecht, and about 1788 to
  the professorship of moral philosophy and ecclesiastical history in the
  university, to which was soon added the professorship of the law of
  nature. The war which followed the French Revolution finally drove Brown
  in January 1795 to London, where he was cordially welcomed. In 1795 the
  magistrates of Aberdeen appointed him to the chair of divinity, and soon
  after he was made principal of Marischal College. In the year 1800 he was
  appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, and in 1804 dean of the
  chapel royal, and of the order of the Thistle. He died on the 11th of May
  1830. His most widely-known works were an <i>Essay on the Natural
  Equality of Men</i> (1793), which gained the Teyler Society's prize; a
  treatise <i>On the Existence of the Supreme Creator</i> (1816), to which
  was awarded the first Burnet prize of £1250; and <i>A Comparative View of
  Christianity, and of the other Forms of Religion with regard to their
  Moral Tendency</i> (2 vols., 1826).</p>

  <p><b>BROWN BESS</b>, a name given in the British army to the flintlock
  musket with which the infantry were formerly armed. The term is applied
  generally to the weapon of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and became
  obsolete on the introduction of the rifle. The first part of the name
  derives from the colour of the wooden stock, for the name is found much
  earlier than the introduction of "browning" the barrel of muskets; "Bess"
  may be either a humorous feminine equivalent of the "brown-bill," the old
  weapon of the British infantry, or a corruption of the "buss,"
  <i>i.e.</i> box, in "blunderbuss."</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, EDWARD HAROLD</b> (1811-1891), English bishop, was born at
  Aylesbury and educated at Eton and Cambridge. He was ordained in 1836,
  and two years later was elected senior tutor of Emmanuel College,
  Cambridge. From 1843 to 1849 he was vice-principal of St David's College,
  Lampeter, and in 1854 was appointed Norrisian professor of divinity at
  Cambridge. His best-known book is the <i>Exposition of the Thirty-nine
  Articles</i> (vol. i., Cambridge, 1850; vol. ii., London, 1853), which
  remained for many years a standard work on the subject. In 1864 he was
  consecrated bishop of Ely, and proceeded to reorganize his diocese. He
  maintained that the deposition of Bishop Colenso endangered the
  independence of bishops. Nevertheless, he was opposed to Colenso's
  criticism of the Bible, and replied to it in <i>The Pentateuch and the
  Elohistic Psalms</i> (1863), written from a conservative standpoint. In
  1869 he was one of the consecrating prelates when Temple became bishop of
  Exeter, and endeavoured to remove the prejudice against his appointment
  by showing that Temple was not responsible for the views of other writers
  in the famous <i>Essays and Reviews</i> (1860). He was bishop of
  Winchester from 1873 till 1890, when ill-health compelled him to
  resign.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, HABLÔT KNIGHT</b> (1815-1882), English artist, famous as
  "Phiz," the illustrator of the best-known books by Charles Dickens,
  Charles Lever and Harrison Ainsworth in their original editions. His
  talents in other directions of art were of a very ordinary kind. As an
  interpreter and illustrator of Dickens's characters, "Phiz," as he always
  signed his drawings, was in some respects the equal of his rivals
  Cruikshank and Leech, while, in his own way, he excelled them both. Of
  Huguenot extraction, he was born in Lambeth on the 11th of June 1815. His
  father died early and left the family badly off. Browne was apprenticed
  to Finden, the eminent engraver on steel, in whose studio he obtained his
  only artistic education. To engraving, however, he was entirely unsuited,
  and having in 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts
  for a drawing of "John Gilpin," he abandoned engraving in the following
  year and took to other artistic work, with the ultimate object of
  becoming a painter. In the spring of 1836 he met Charles <!-- Page 664
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page664"></a>[v.04
  p.0664]</span>Dickens. It was at the moment when the serial publication
  of <i>Pickwick</i> was in danger from the want of a capable interpreter
  for the illustrations. Dickens knew Browne slightly as the illustrator of
  his little pamphlet <i>Sunday under Three Heads</i>, and probably this
  slight knowledge of his work stood the draughtsman in good stead. In the
  original edition of <i>Pickwick</i>, issued in shilling monthly parts
  from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were
  drawn by Robert Seymour, a clever illustrator who committed suicide in
  April 1836. The next two plates were by R.W. Buss, an otherwise
  successful portrait-painter and lecturer, but they were so poor that a
  change was imperative. Browne and W.M. Thackeray called independently at
  the publishers' office with specimens of their powers for Dickens's
  inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne's first two etched
  plates for <i>Pickwick</i> were signed "Nemo," but the third was signed
  "Phiz," a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain
  why he chose this name he answered that the change from "Nemo" to "Phiz"
  was made "to harmonize better with Dickens's Boz." Possibly Browne
  adopted it to conceal his identity, hoping one day to become famous as a
  painter. It is to be noted, however, that "Phiz" is usually attached to
  his better work and H.K.B. to his less successful drawings. "Phiz"
  undoubtedly created Sam Weller, so far as his well-known figure is
  concerned, as Seymour had created Pickwick. Dickens and "Phiz" were
  personally good friends in early days, and in 1838 travelled together to
  Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero;
  afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to
  facilitate the illustrator's work. The other Dickens characters which
  "Phiz" realized most successfully are perhaps Squeers, Micawber, Guppy,
  Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and, above all, David Copperfield. Of
  the books by Dickens which "Phiz" illustrated the best are <i>David
  Copperfield</i>, <i>Pickwick</i>, <i>Dombey and Son</i>, <i>Martin
  Chuzzlewit</i> and <i>Bleak House</i>. Browne made several drawings for
  <i>Punch</i> in early days and also towards the end of his life; his
  chief work in this direction being the clever design for the wrapper
  which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed
  to <i>Punch's Pocket Books</i>. In addition to his work for Dickens,
  "Phiz" illustrated over twenty of Lever's novels (the most successful
  being <i>Harry Lorrequer</i>, <i>Charles O'Malley</i>, <i>Jack Hinton</i>
  and the <i>Knight of Gwynne</i>). He also illustrated Harrison
  Ainsworth's and Frank Smedley's novels. <i>Mervyn Clitheroe</i> by
  Ainsworth is one of the most admirable of the artist's Works. Browne was
  in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he had a stroke of
  paralysis. Although he recovered slightly and made many illustrations on
  wood, they were by comparison inferior productions which the
  draughtsman's admirers would willingly ignore. In 1878 he was awarded an
  annuity by the Royal Academy. He gradually became worse in health, until
  he died on the 8th of July 1882.</p>

  <p>Most of Browne's work was etched on steel plates because these yielded
  a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his
  etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as
  lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this
  treatment of his work he employed a machine to rule a series of lines
  over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when
  manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling
  mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to
  transfer to stone. The illustrations executed by Browne are particularly
  noteworthy because they realized exactly what the reader most desired to
  see represented. So skilful was he in drawing and composition that no
  part of the story was avoided by reason of the elaborateness of the
  subject. Whatever was the best incident for illustration was always the
  one selected.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, ISAAC HAWKINS</b> (1705-1760), English poet, was born on
  the 21st of January 1705 at Burton-upon-Trent, of which place his father
  was vicar. He was educated at Lichfield, at Westminster school, and at
  Trinity College, Cambridge. After taking his M.A. degree he removed to
  Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar, but never practised. He was the
  author of "Design and Beauty," a poem addressed to his friend Joseph
  Highmore the painter; and of "The Pipe of Tobacco" which parodied Cibber,
  Ambrose Philips, Thomson, Young, Pope and Swift, who were then all
  living. He was elected to Parliament through private interest in 1744 and
  again in 1747 for the borough of Wenlock in Shropshire. In 1754 he
  published his chief work, <i>De Animi Immortalitate</i>, a Latin poem
  much admired by the scholars of his time. The best of the many
  translations of these verses is by Soame Jenyns. Browne is said by
  Johnson to have been "one of the first wits of this country." He was a
  brilliant talker in private life, especially when his tongue was loosed
  by wine; but he made no mark in public life. He died in London on the
  14th of February 1760.</p>

  <p>Two editions of his <i>Poems on Various Subjects, Latin and
  English</i>, were published in 1767 by his son Isaac Hawkins Browne
  (1745-1818), the author of two volumes of essays on religion and morals.
  One of these was printed for private circulation, and is said to have
  contained a memoir. A full account by Andrew Kippis in <i>Biographia
  Britannica</i> (1780) includes large extracts from his poems.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, JAMES</b> (1703-1841), Scottish man of letters, was born at
  Whitefield, Perthshire, in 1793. He was educated at Edinburgh and at the
  university of St Andrews, where he studied for the church. He wrote a
  "Sketch of the History of Edinburgh," for Ewbank's <i>Picturesque
  Views</i> of that city, 1823-1825. In 1826 he became a member of the
  Faculty of Advocates, and obtained the degree of LL.D. from King's
  College, Aberdeen. His works include a <i>Critical Examination of
  Macculloch's Work on the Highlands and Islands of Scotland</i> (1826),
  <i>Aperçu sur les Hiêroglyphes d'Égypte</i> (Paris, 1827), a
  <i>Vindication of the Scottish Bar from the Attacks of Mr Broughton</i>,
  and <i>History of the Highlands and Highland Clans</i> (1834-1836). He
  was appointed editor of the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i> in 1827; and two
  years later he became sub-editor of the seventh edition of the
  <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, to which he contributed a large number
  of articles. He died in April 1841.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, SIR JAMES</b> (1839-1896), Anglo-Indian engineer and
  administrator, was the son of Robert Browne of Falkirk in Scotland. He
  was educated at the military college, Addiscombe, and received a
  commission in the Bengal engineers in 1857. He served in the expedition
  against the Mahsud Waziris in 1860, being mentioned in despatches, and in
  1863 in the Umbeyla campaign, when he was three times mentioned. In
  January 1875 he became superintendent of works for the building of the
  Indus bridge. In 1877 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in
  1878-1879 accompanied Sir Donald Stewart as political officer during the
  Afghan War. He took part in several engagements, was mentioned in
  despatches, and received the C.B. In 1881 he became colonel, and in 1882
  commanded the Indian engineer contingent sent to Egypt, being present at
  the battle of Tell-el-Kebir. For his services in Egypt he received the
  3rd class of the Osmanieh Order and the khedive's star. In 1884 he was
  appointed engineer in chief of the Sind-Pishin railway. In 1888 he was
  made a K.C.S.I, and in 1889 quarter-master-general for India. In 1892 he
  was appointed agent to the governor-general in Baluchistan, in succession
  to Sir Robert Sandeman, his intimate experience of the Baluchis, gained
  during his railway work, having specially fitted him for this post. He
  died suddenly on the 13th of June 1896. Sir James Browne was a man of
  splendid courage and physique, and many tales are told of the personal
  prowess which, together with his sympathetic knowledge of the natives,
  made him a popular hero among the frontier tribesmen.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, MAXIMILIAN ULYSSES,</b> <span class="sc">Count von, Baron
  de Camus and Mountany</span> (1705-1757), Austrian field marshal, was
  born at Basel on the 23rd of October 1705. His father (Ulysses Freiherr
  v. Browne, d. 1731) was an Irish exile of 1690, who entered the imperial
  service and in 1716 was made a count <!-- Page 665 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page665"></a>[v.04 p.0665]</span>of the Empire
  (<i>Reichsgraf</i>) by the emperor Charles VI. His uncle Georg,
  Reichsgraf von Browne (1698-1792), was a distinguished soldier, who rose
  to the rank of field marshal in the Russian army, and was made Reichsgraf
  by the emperor Joseph II. in 1779. The powerful influence which he
  commanded, through his father and his wife (<i>née</i> Countess Marie
  Philippine v. Martinitz), advanced the young officer through the
  subordinate grades so rapidly that at the age of twenty-nine he was
  colonel of an infantry regiment. But he justified his early promotion in
  the field, and in the Italian campaign of 1734 he greatly distinguished
  himself. In the Tirolese fighting of 1735, and in the unfortunate Turkish
  war, he won further distinction as a general officer. He was a lieutenant
  field marshal in command of the Silesian garrisons when in 1740 Frederick
  II. and the Prussian army overran the province. His careful employment of
  such resources as he possessed materially hindered the king in his
  conquest and gave time for Austria to collect a field army (see <span
  class="sc">Austrian Succession, War of the</span>). He was present at
  Mollwitz, where he received a severe wound. His vehement opposition to
  all half-hearted measures brought him frequently into conflict with his
  superiors, but contributed materially to the unusual energy displayed by
  the Austrian armies in 1742 and 1743. In the following campaigns Browne
  exhibited the same qualities of generalship and the same impatience of
  control. In 1745 he served under Count Traun, and was promoted to the
  rank of Feldzeugmeister. In 1746 he was present in the Italian campaign
  and the battles of Piacenza and Rottofredo. Browne himself with the
  advanced guard forced his way across the Apennines and entered Genoa. He
  was thereafter placed in command of the army intended for the invasion of
  France, and early in 1747 of all the imperial forces in Italy. At the end
  of the war Browne was engaged in the negotiations which led to the
  convention of Nice (January 21st, 1749). He became commander-in-chief in
  Bohemia in 1751, and field marshal two years later. He was still in
  Bohemia when the Seven Years' War opened with Frederick's invasion of
  Saxony (1756). Browne's army, advancing to the relief of Pirna (see <span
  class="sc">Seven Years' War</span>), was met, and, after a hard struggle,
  defeated by the king at Lobositz, but he drew off in excellent order, and
  soon made another attempt with a picked force to reach Pirna, by wild
  mountain tracks. The field marshal never spared himself, bivouacking in
  the snow with his men, and Carlyle records that private soldiers made
  rough shelters over him as he slept. He actually reached the Elbe at
  Schandau, but as the Saxons were unable to break out Browne retired,
  having succeeded, however, in delaying the development of Frederick's
  operations for a whole campaign. In the campaign of 1757 he voluntarily
  served under Prince Charles of Lorraine (<i>q.v.</i>) who was made
  commander-in-chief, and on the 6th of May in that year, while leading a
  bayonet charge at the battle of Prague, Browne, like Schwerin on the same
  day, met his death. He was carried mortally wounded into Prague, and
  there died on the 26th of June, his last days embittered by the knowledge
  that he was unjustly held responsible for the failure of the campaign.
  His name has been borne, since 1888, by the 36th Austrian infantry.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, PETER</b> (?1665-1735), Irish divine and bishop of Cork and
  Ross, was born in Co. Dublin, not long after the Restoration. He entered
  Trinity College, Dublin, in 1682, and after ten years' residence obtained
  a fellowship. In 1699 he was made provost of the college, and in the same
  year published his <i>Letter in answer to a Book entitled "Christianity
  not Mysterious,"</i> which was recognized as the ablest reply yet written
  to Toland. It expounds in germ the whole of his later theory of analogy.
  In 1710 he was made bishop of Cork and Ross, which post he held till his
  death in 1733. In 1713 he had become somewhat notorious from his vigorous
  pamphleteering attack on the fashion of drinking healths, especially "to
  the glorious and immortal memory." His two most important works are the
  <i>Procedure, Extent, and, Limits of the Human Understanding</i> (1728),
  an able though sometimes captious critique of Locke's essay, and
  <i>Things Divine and Supernatural conceived by Analogy with Things
  Natural and Human</i>, more briefly referred to as the <i>Divine
  Analogy</i> (1733). The doctrine of analogy was intended as a reply to
  the deistical conclusions that had been drawn from Locke's theory of
  knowledge. Browne holds that not only God's essence, but his attributes
  are inexpressible by our ideas, and can only be conceived analogically.
  This view was vigorously assailed as leading to atheism by Berkeley in
  his <i>Alciphron</i> (Dialogue iv.), and a great part of the <i>Divine
  Analogy</i> is occupied with a defence against that criticism. The bishop
  emphasizes the distinction between metaphor and analogy; though the
  conceived attributes are not thought as they are in themselves, yet there
  is a reality corresponding in some way to our ideas of them. His
  analogical arguments resemble those found in the Bampton Lectures of Dean
  Mansel. Browne was a man of abstemious habits, charitable disposition,
  and impressive eloquence. He died on the 27th of August 1735.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, ROBERT</b> (1550-1633), a leader among the early Separatist
  Puritans (hence sometimes called Brownists), was born about 1550 at
  Tolethorpe, near Stamford. He was of an ancient family, several members
  of which had been distinguished as merchants, county magnates and local
  benefactors. He was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
  "commencing B.A." in 1572. For some years he was a schoolmaster, but in
  what place is uncertain. In 1579, on a brother's application and without
  his own consent, he was licensed to preach, and actually preached for
  some six months in Cambridge, where he gained considerable popularity;
  but impugning the episcopal order of the Established Church, he had his
  licence revoked early in the following year. He then went, on the
  invitation of Robert Harrison, "Maister in the Hospitall," to Norwich,
  where he soon gathered a numerous congregation, the members of which
  became associated in a religious "covenant," to the refusing of "all
  ungodlie communion with wicked persons." He seems also to have preached
  in various parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, especially at Bury St Edmunds,
  and vigorously denounced the form of government existing in the Church,
  which at this time he held incompatible with true "preaching of the
  word." Dr Freake, bishop of Norwich, caused him to be imprisoned early in
  1581, but he was ere long released through the influence of his remote
  kinsman, the Lord Treasurer Burghley. Before the end of 1581, however, he
  incurred two more imprisonments, and, apparently in January 1582,
  migrated with his whole company to Middelburg in Zealand. There they
  organized a church on what they conceived to be the New Testament model,
  but the community broke up within two years owing to internal
  dissensions.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Browne issued two most important works, <i>A Treatise of
  Reformation without Tarying for Anie</i>, in which he asserts the
  inalienable right of the church to effect necessary reforms without the
  authorization or permission of the civil magistrate; and <i>A Booke which
  sheweth the life and manners of all True Christians</i>, in which he
  enunciates the theory of Congregational independency (see <span
  class="sc">Congregationalism</span>). These, with a third tract (<i>A
  Treatise upon the 23. of Matthew</i>, see C. Burrage, as below, pp.
  21-25), making together a thin quarto, were published at Middelburg in
  1582. The following year two men were hanged at Bury St Edmunds for
  circulating them. In January 1584<a name="FnAnchor_181"
  href="#Footnote_181"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Browne and some of his company
  came to Edinburgh, after visiting Dundee and St Andrews. He remained some
  months in Scotland, endeavouring to commend his ecclesiastical theories,
  but had no success. He then returned to Stamford, in which town or
  neighbourhood he seems to have resided chiefly for the next two years,
  his residence being broken by visits to London and probably to the
  continent (early in 1585), and by at least one imprisonment (summer,
  1585). His attitude to the lawfulness of occasional attendance at
  services in parish churches seems to have been changing about this time;
  on the <!-- Page 666 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page666"></a>[v.04
  p.0666]</span>7th of October 1585 he was induced to make a qualified
  submission to the established order. The story that this result was
  brought about by excommunication, actual or threatened, is very doubtful,
  and rests on late and questionable authority. A further submission
  prepared the way for his appointment, in November 1586, to the mastership
  of St Olave's grammar school, Southwark, which he held for more than two
  years. During part of this time he was much engaged in controversy, on
  the one hand with Stephen Bredwell, an uncompromising advocate of the
  established order, and on the other with some of those who more or less
  occupied his own earlier position, and now looked upon him as a renegade.
  In particular he several times replied to Barrowe and Greenwood; one of
  his replies, entitled <i>A Reproofe of certaine schismatical persons and
  their doctrine touching the hearing and preaching of the word of God</i>
  (1587-1588), has recently been recovered, and sheds a flood of light upon
  the development of Browne's later views (see Burrage, pp. 45-62, for this
  whole period).</p>

  <p>Before the 20th of June 1589 his mastership of St Olave's seems to
  have terminated, and after being rector of Little Casterton (in the gift
  of his eldest brother) for a month or two, he finally, in September 1591,
  accepted episcopal ordination and the rectory of Achurch-cum-Thorpe
  Waterville, in Northamptonshire. There he ministered for forty-two years,
  with one lengthy interval, 1617-1626, which is only partly accounted for
  (see Burrage, pp. 68-71). There is reason to believe that he never
  entirely abandoned his early ideal, but latterly thought it possible to
  maintain a spiritual fellowship within the framework of the Established
  Church. The closing years of his life seem to have been clouded, due
  partly to separation among his own flock, and partly to growing
  irritability in himself, a lonely and disappointed man. When over eighty
  years old he had a dispute with the parish constable about a rate, blows
  were struck, and before a magistrate he behaved so stubbornly that he was
  sent to Northampton gaol, where he died in October 1633. He was buried in
  St Giles's churchyard, Northampton. In spite of his later attitude of
  compromise with expediency, which he felt forced on him by external
  conditions too strong to defy or ignore, Robert Browne remains a pioneer
  in ecclesiastical theory in England, the first formulator of an ideal
  which subsequently became known as Congregationalism (<i>q.v.</i>). He
  rediscovered certain forgotten aspects of primitive church life, and did
  not shrink from suffering for the sake of what he held to be the truth.
  In addition to the works above-mentioned, Browne wrote several
  controversial and apologetic treatises, of which some remained in MS.
  until quite recently, and some are still missing.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, SIR THOMAS</b> (1605-1682), English author and physician,
  was born in London, on the 19th of October 1605. He was admitted as a
  scholar of Winchester school in 1616, and matriculated at Broadgates Hall
  (Pembroke College), Oxford, in 1623, where he graduated B.A. in January
  1626. He took the further degree of M.A. in 1629, studied medicine, and
  practised for some time in Oxfordshire. Between 1630 and 1633 he left
  England, travelled in Ireland, France and Italy, and on his way home
  received the degree of M.D. at the university of Leiden. He returned to
  London in 1634, and, after a short residence at Shipden Hall, near
  Halifax, settled in practice at Norwich in 1637. He married in 1641
  Dorothy Mileham. Their eldest son, Edward, became president of the Royal
  College of Physicians, and glimpses of their happy family life are
  obtainable in the fragmentary correspondence contained in Simon Wilkin's
  edition. In 1642 a copy of his <i>Religio Medici</i>, which he describes
  as "a private exercise directed to myself," was printed from one of his
  MSS. without his knowledge, and reviewed by Sir Kenelm Digby in
  <i>Observations ...</i> (1643). The interest aroused by this edition
  compelled Browne to put forth a correct version (1643) of the work, in
  which letters between Digby and Browne were included. The book was
  probably written as early as 1635, for he describes himself as still
  under thirty. In 1646 he published <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica; Enquiries
  into very many commonly received Tenents and commonly presumed Truths</i>
  (1646), and in 1658 <i>Hydriotaphia, Urne-Buriall; or, a discourse of the
  sepulchrall urnes lately found in Norfolk. Together with the Garden of
  Cyrus, or the quincunciall, lozenge, or net-work plantations of the
  ancients, artificially, naturally, and mystically considered. With Sundry
  observations</i> (1658). These four works were all that he published,
  though several tracts, notably the <i>Christian Morals</i><a
  name="FnAnchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"><sup>[1]</sup></a> intended as a
  continuation of <i>Religio Medici</i>, were prepared for publication, and
  appeared posthumously. In 1671 he received the honour of knighthood from
  Charles II. on his visit to Norwich. He began a correspondence with John
  Evelyn in 1658. Very few of the letters are extant, but the diarist has
  left an account of a visit to Browne (<i>Diary</i>, 17th of October
  1671). He died in 1682 on his seventy-seventh birthday, and was buried at
  St Peter's, Mancroft, Norwich. His coffin was accidentally broken in
  1840, and his skull is preserved in the museum of the Norwich
  hospital.</p>

  <p>Browne's writings are among the few specimens of purely literary work
  produced during a period of great political excitement and discord. He
  remained to all appearance placidly indifferent to the struggle going on
  around him. His first book appeared in the year of the outbreak of the
  Civil War; <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i> in the critical year of 1646; and
  <i>Hydriotaphia</i>, the reflections on the shortness of human life
  inspired by the unearthing of some funeral urns, on the eve of the
  Restoration. A mind as aloof as his is a psychological curiosity, and its
  peculiarities are faithfully reflected in the form and matter of his
  works. His display of erudition, his copious citations from authorities,
  his constant use of metaphor and analogy, and his elaborate diction, are
  common qualities of the writers of the 17th century, but Browne stands
  apart from his contemporaries by reason of the peculiar cast of his mind.
  Imbued with the Platonic mysticism which taught him to look on this world
  as only the image, the shadow of an invisible system, he regarded the
  whole of experience as only food for contemplation. Nothing is too great
  or too small for him; all finds a place in the universe of being, which
  he seems to regard almost from the position of an outsider. He did not
  speculate systematically on the problems of existence, but he meditates
  repeatedly on the outward and visible signs of mortality, and on what
  lies beyond death. Of Browne, as of the greatest writers, it is true that
  the style is the man. The form of his thought is as peculiar and
  remarkable as the matter; the two, indeed, react on one another. Much of
  the quaintness of his style, no doubt, depends on the excessive
  employment of latinized words, many of which have failed to justify their
  existence; but the peculiarities of his vocabulary do not explain the
  unique character of his writing, which is appreciated to-day as much as
  ever.</p>

  <p>The <i>Religio Medici</i> was a puzzle to his contemporaries, and it
  is still hard to reconcile its contradictions. A Latin translation
  appeared at Leiden in 1644, and it was widely read on the continent,
  being translated subsequently into Dutch, French and German. In Paris it
  was issued in the belief that Browne was really a Roman Catholic, but in
  Rome the authorities thought otherwise, and the book was placed on the
  <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>. It is the confession of a mind keen and
  sceptical in some aspects, and credulous in others. Browne professes to
  be absolutely free from heretical opinions, but asserts the right to be
  guided by his own reason in cases where no precise guidance is given
  either by Scripture or by Church teaching. "I love," he says, "to lose
  myself in a mystery, to pursue my reason to an O, Altitudo!" The
  <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>, written in a more direct and simple style
  than is usual with Browne, is a wonderful storehouse of out-of-the-way
  facts and scraps of erudition, <!-- Page 667 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page667"></a>[v.04 p.0667]</span>exhibiting a singular mixture of
  credulity and shrewdness. Sir Thomas evidently takes delight in
  discussing the wildest fables. That he himself was by no means free from
  superstition is proved by the fact that the condemnation of two
  unfortunate women, Amy Duny and Rose Cullender, for witchcraft at Norwich
  in 1664 was aided by his professional evidence. The <i>Garden of
  Cyrus</i> is a continued illustration of one quaint conceit. The whole
  universe is ransacked for examples of the <i>Quincunx</i>, and he
  discovers, as Coleridge says, "quincunxes in heaven above, quincunxes in
  earth below, quincunxes in the mind of man, quincunxes in tones, in optic
  nerves, in roots of trees, in leaves, in everything!" But the whole
  strength of his genius and the wonderful charm of his style are to be
  sought in the <i>Urnburial</i>, the concluding chapter of which, for
  richness of imagery and majestic pomp of diction, can hardly be
  paralleled in the English language. For anything at all resembling it we
  must turn to the finest passages of Jeremy Taylor or of Milton's prose
  writings.</p>

  <p>In 1684 appeared a collection of <i>Certain Miscellany Tracts</i> (ed.
  Tenison), and in 1712 <i>Posthumous Works of the learned Sir Thomas
  Browne</i>. The first collected edition of Browne's works appeared in
  1686. It is said to have been edited by Dr, afterwards Archbishop
  Tenison. Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Works, including his Life and
  Correspondence</i>, were carefully edited by Simon Wilkin in 1835-1836.
  Among modern reprints may be mentioned Dr W.A. Greenhill's editions in
  the "Golden Treasury" series of the <i>Religio Medici, Letter to a
  friend</i> and <i>Christian Morals</i> (1881), with an admirable
  bibliographical note on the complicated subject of the numerous editions
  of the <i>Religio Medici</i>; of the <i>Hydriotaphia</i> and the
  <i>Garden of Cyrus</i> (1896), completed by Mr E.H. Marshall; a complete
  edition for the English Library, edited by Mr Charles Sayle (1904,
  &amp;c.). Browne's interest in bird-lore is noted by Evelyn, and some
  <i>Notes and Letters on the Natural History of Norfolk</i> were collected
  from his MSS. in the Sloane Collection, and edited by Thomas Southwell in
  1902.</p>

  <i>Christian Morals</i>, but Dr W.A. Greenhill thinks it was written
  later.</p>

</div>
  <p><b>BROWNE, WILLIAM</b> (1591-1643), English pastoral poet, was born at
  Tavistock, Devonshire, in 1591, of a branch of the family of Browne of
  Betchworth Castle, Surrey. He received his early education at the grammar
  school of his native town, and is said to have proceeded to Oxford about
  1603. After a short residence at Clifford's Inn he entered the Inner
  Temple in 1611. His elegy on the death of Henry, prince of Wales, and the
  first book of <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i> appeared in 1613; the
  <i>Shepherd's Pipe</i>, which contained some eclogues by other poets, in
  1614. The second book of the pastorals (1616) is dedicated to William
  Herbert, earl of Pembroke, whose seat at Wilton was Browne's home for
  some time. In 1624 he returned to Oxford as tutor to Robert Dormer,
  afterwards earl of Carnarvon, matriculating at Exeter College in April
  and receiving his M.A. degree in November of the same year. Nearly all
  Browne's poetic work dates from his early manhood, before his marriage in
  1628 with Timothy, daughter of Sir Thomas Eversham of Horsham, Essex. In
  the fourth eclogue of George Wither's <i>Shepherd's Hunting</i>, written
  as early as 1613-1614, Philarete (Wither) asks Willy (Browne) why he is
  silent, and the reply is that some "my music do contemne." The times were
  unfavourable to his tranquil talent, and the second half of his life was
  spent in retirement. He died some time before 1645, when letters of
  administration were granted to his widow, and he may have been the
  William Browne whose burial is recorded in the Tavistock registers under
  the date of the 27th of March 1643.</p>

  <p>Browne was the pupil and friend of Michael Drayton, who associates "my
  Browne" in the "Epistle to Henry Reynolds" with the two Beaumonts as "my
  dear companions whom I freely chose, My bosom friends." But directly
  indebted as Browne is for the form of his poems, for the slight story and
  the rather wearisome allegory, to Spenser, Sidney, Drayton and especially
  to Fletcher's <i>Faithful Shepherdess</i>, his poetry is no mere copy of
  any of these models. His Arcadia is localized in his native Devonshire.
  He was untiring in his praises of "Tavy's voiceful stream (to whom I owe
  more strains than from my pipe can ever flow)." He knew local history and
  traditions, and he celebrates the gallant sailors who "by their power
  made the Devonian shore Mock the proud Tagus." (<i>Brit. Past.</i> bk.
  ii., song 3). It is for his truthful, affectionate pictures of his
  country life and its surroundings that the stories of Marina and
  Celandine, Doridon and the rest are still read. A copy of Browne's
  pastorals with annotations in Milton's handwriting is preserved in the
  Huth library, and there are many points of likeness between Lycidas and
  the elegy on Philarete (Thomas Manwood) in the fourth eclogue of the
  <i>Shepherd's Pipe</i>. Keats was a student of Browne, and Herrick's
  fairy fantasies are thought to owe something to the third book of the
  pastorals.</p>

  <p>The first two books of <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i> were re-issued in
  1625. The third, though it had no doubt circulated in the author's
  lifetime, remained unknown until Beriah Botfield discovered a copy of it
  in the library of Salisbury cathedral, bound up with the 1613 and 1616
  editions of the first and second books. This MS. was edited for the Percy
  Society by T.C. Croker in 1852. A collected edition of Browne's works was
  published in 1772 by John Davies. It is not known whether <i>The Inner
  Temple Masque</i> on the story of Ulysses and Circe, which was written
  for performance on the 13th of January 1615, was ever actually
  represented. A series of sonnets to Caelia, some epistles, elegies and
  epitaphs, with some other miscellaneous poems, complete the list of
  Browne's works. These have been collected from various sources, the most
  important being Lansdowne MS. 777 (British Museum), and they were printed
  for the first time by Sir S.E. Brydges in 1815. Excellent modern complete
  editions of Browne and Mr W.C. Hazlitt's (1868-1869) for the Roxburghe
  library, and a more compact one (1894) by Mr Gordon Goodwin, with an
  introduction by Mr A.H. Bullen, for the "Muse's Library." For an
  elaborate analysis of Browne's obligations to earlier pastoral writers
  see F.W. Moorman, "William Browne" (<i>Quellen und Forschungen zur
  Sprach- und Culturgeschichte der Germanischen Völker</i> Strassburg,
  1897). A translation of Marin le Roy de Gomberville's <i>Polexandre</i>,
  by William Browne (1647), may be a posthumous work of the poet's.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNE, WILLIAM GEORGE</b> (1768-1813), English traveller, was born
  at Great Tower Hill, London, on the 25th of July 1768. At seventeen he
  was sent to Oriel College, Oxford. Having had a moderate competence left
  him by his father, on quitting the university he applied himself entirely
  to literary pursuits. But the fame of James Bruce's travels, and of the
  first discoveries made by the African Association, determined him to
  become an explorer of Central Africa. He went first to Egypt, arriving at
  Alexandria in January 1792. He spent some time in visiting the oasis of
  Siwa or Jupiter Ammon, and employed the remainder of the year in studying
  Arabic and in examining the ruins of ancient Egypt. In the spring of 1793
  he visited Sinai, and in May set out for Darfur, joining the great
  caravan which every year went by the desert route from Egypt to that
  country. This was his most important journey, in which he acquired a
  great variety of original information. He was forcibly detained by the
  sultan of Darfur and endured much hardship, being unable to effect his
  purpose of returning by Abyssinia. He was, however, allowed to return to
  Egypt with the caravan in 1796; after this he spent a year in Syria, and
  did not arrive in London till September 1798. In 1799 he published his
  <i>Travels in Africa, Egypt and Syria, from the year 1792 to 1798</i>.
  The work was full of valuable information; but, from the abruptness and
  dryness of the style, it never became popular. In 1800 Browne again left
  England, and spent three years in visiting Greece, some parts of Asia
  Minor and Sicily. In 1812 he once more set out for the East, proposing to
  penetrate to Samarkand and survey the most interesting regions of central
  Asia. He spent the winter in Smyrna, and in the spring of 1813 travelled
  through Asia Minor and Armenia, made a short stay at Erzerum, and arrived
  on the 1st of June at Tabriz. About the end of the summer of 1813 he left
  Tabriz for Teheran, intending to proceed thence into Tartary, but was
  shortly afterwards murdered. Some bones, believed to be his, were
  afterwards found and interred near the grave of Jean de Thevenot, the
  French traveller.</p>

  <p>Robert Walpole published, in the second volume of his <i>Memoirs
  relating to European and Asiatic Turkey</i> (1820), from papers left by
  Browne, the account of his journey in 1802 through Asia Minor to Antioch
  and Cyprus; also <i>Remarks written at Constantinople</i> (1802).</p>

  <p><b>BROWNING, ELIZABETH BARRETT</b> (1806-1861), English poet, wife of
  the poet Robert Browning, was born probably at Coxhoe Hall, Durham, for
  this was the home of her father and mother for some time after their
  marriage in 1805. Her baptismal register gives the date of her birth as
  the 6th of March 1806, and that of her christening as the 10th of
  February 1808. The long misunderstanding as to her age, whereby she was
  supposed to have been born three years later, was shared by her
  contemporaries and even for a time by her husband. She was the daughter
  and eldest child of Edward Barrett Moulton, who added the surname of
  Barrett on the death of his maternal grandfather, whose estates in
  Jamaica he inherited. His wife was Mary Graham-Clarke, daughter of J.
  Graham-Clarke of Fenham Hall, Newcastle-on-Tyne. She died when her
  illustrious daughter was twenty-two years old. Elizabeth's childhood was
  passed in the country, chiefly at Hope End, a house bought by her father
  in the beautiful country in sight of the Malvern Hills. "They seem to
  me," she wrote, "my native hills; for though I was born in the county of
  Durham, I was an infant when I went first into their neighbourhood, and
  lived there until I had passed twenty by several years." Her country
  poems, such as "The Lost Bower," "Hector in the Garden," and "The
  Deserted Garden," refer to the woods and gardens of Hope End. Elizabeth
  Barrett was much the companion of her father, who pleased himself with
  printing fifty copies of what she calls her "great epic of eleven or
  twelve years old, in four books"&mdash;<i>The Battle of Marathon</i>
  (sent to the printer in 1819). She owns this to have been "a curious
  production for a child," but disclaims for it anything more than "an
  imitative faculty." The love of Pope's Homer, she adds, led her to the
  study of Greek, and of Latin as a help to Greek, "and the influence of
  all those tendencies is manifest so long afterwards as in my <i>Essay on
  Mind</i> [<i>Essay on Mind and other Poems</i>, 1826], a didactic poem
  written when I was seventeen or eighteen, and long repented of." She was
  a keen student, and it is told of her that when her health failed she had
  her Greek books bound so as to look like novels, for fear her doctor
  should forbid her continuous study. At this time began her friendship
  with the blind scholar Hugh Stuart Boyd, with whom she read Greek
  authors, and especially the Greek Christian Fathers and Poets. To him she
  addressed later three of her sonnets, and he was one of her chief friends
  until his death in 1848. In 1832 Mr Barrett sold his house of Hope End,
  and brought his family to Sidmouth, Devon, for some three years. There
  Elizabeth made a translation of the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> of Aeschylus,
  published with some original poems (1833). After that time London became
  the home of the Barretts until the children married and the father died.
  The temporary dwelling was at 74 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, and in
  1838 the lease was taken of the final house, 50 Wimpole Street.</p>

  <p>It is in the middle of the year 1836 that Elizabeth Barrett's active
  literary life began. She then made the acquaintance of R.H. Horne,
  afterwards famous for a time as the author of <i>Orion</i>, but perhaps
  best remembered as her correspondent (<i>Letters to R.H. Horne</i>, 2
  vols. 1877), and this acquaintance led to the appearance of rather
  frequent poems by Miss Barrett in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, edited
  by Bulwer (Lord Lytton), and in other magazines or annuals. But the
  publication of <i>The Seraphim and other Poems</i> (1838) was a graver
  step. "My present attempt," she writes in this year, "<i>is</i> actually,
  and will be considered by others, more a trial of strength than either of
  my preceding ones." There was at that date a lull in the production of
  conspicuous books of poetry. Wordsworth had ceased, Browning and Tennyson
  had hardly begun to write their best. Miss Barrett's volume was well
  reviewed, but not popular, and no second edition was required; of the
  poems afterwards famous it contained three, "Cowper's Grave," "My Doves,"
  and "The Sea-Mew," the first impassioned and the other two very quiet,
  which a fine taste must rank high among all her works. <i>The Quarterly
  Review</i> (September 1840), in an article on "Modern English Poetesses,"
  criticizes <i>The Seraphim</i> with <i>Prometheus</i>, and treats the
  former with respect, but does not lift the author out of the quite
  unequal company of Mrs Norton, "V," and other contemporary women. In the
  previous year Elizabeth had made the memorable acquaintance of
  Wordsworth. "No," she writes, "I was not at all disappointed in
  Wordsworth, although perhaps I should not have singled him from the
  multitude as a great man. There is a <i>reserve</i> even in his
  countenance; ... his eyes have more meekness than brilliancy; and in his
  slow, even articulation there is rather the solemnity and calmness of
  <i>truth</i> itself than the animation and energy of those who seek for
  it ... He was very kind, and sate near me and talked to me as long as he
  was in the room, and recited a translation by Cary of a sonnet of
  Dante's&mdash;and altogether it was a dream." With Landor, at the same
  date, a meeting took place that had long results. At this time, too,
  began another of Elizabeth's valued friendships&mdash;that with Miss
  Mitford, author of <i>Our Village</i> and other works less well
  remembered. Mr John Kenyon also became at about this time a dear and
  intimate friend. He was a distant cousin of the Barretts, had published
  some verse, and was a warm and generous friend to men of letters. From
  the date of the birth of their child (1849) he gave the Brownings a
  hundred pounds a year, and when he died in 1856 he bequeathed to them
  eleven thousand pounds. To him a great number of Elizabeth's letters are
  addressed, and to him in later years was <i>Aurora Leigh</i> dedicated.
  Elizabeth Barrett began also in London an acquaintance with Harriet
  Martineau.</p>

  <p>Full of the interest of friendship and literature, the residence in
  London was unfavourable to Elizabeth's health. In early girlhood she had
  a spinal affection, and her lungs became delicate. She broke a
  blood-vessel in the beginning of the Barretts' life in town, and was
  thereafter an invalid&mdash;by no means entirely confined to her room,
  but often imprisoned there, and generally a recluse, until her marriage.
  Her state was so threatening that in 1838 it was found necessary to
  remove her to Torquay, where she spent three years, accompanied by her
  brother Edward, the dearest of her eight brothers, the only one, she said
  many years later, who ever comprehended her, and for a time by her father
  and sisters. During this time of physical suffering she underwent the
  greatest grief of her life by the drowning of her beloved brother, who
  with two friends went sailing in a small boat and was lost in Babbacombe
  Bay. Rumours of the foundering reached the unhappy sister, who was
  assured of the worst after three days, when the bodies were found. The
  accident of Edward Barrett's meeting with his death through her residence
  at Torquay, and the minor accident of her having parted from him on the
  day of his death, as she said, "with pettish words," increased her
  anguish of heart to horror. A few days before she had written, "There are
  so many mercies close around me that God's being seems proved to me,
  <i>demonstrated</i> to me, by His manifested love." When the blow came,
  its heavy weight and closeness to her heart convinced her, she wrote,
  through an awful experience of suffering, of divine action. But many
  years later the mention of her brother's death was intolerable to her. At
  the time she only did not die. She had to remain for nearly a year day
  and night within hearing of the sea, of which the sound seemed to her the
  moan of a dying man.</p>

  <p>There is here an interval of silence in the correspondence which
  busied her secluded life at all ages; but with an impulse of
  self-protection she went to work as soon as her strength sufficed. One of
  her tasks was a part taken in the <i>Chaucer Modernized</i> (1841), a
  work suggested by Wordsworth, to which he, Leigh Hunt, Horne and others
  contributed. In 1841 she returned to Wimpole Street, and in that and the
  <!-- Page 669 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page669"></a>[v.04
  p.0669]</span>following year she was at work on two series of articles on
  the Greek Christian poets and on the English poets, written for the
  <i>Athenaeum</i> under the editorship of Mr C.W. Dilke. In work she found
  some interest and even some delight: "Once I wished not to live, but the
  faculty of life seems to have sprung up in me again from under the
  crushing foot of heavy grief. Be it all as God wills."</p>

  <p>It is in 1842 that we notice the name of Robert Browning in her
  letters: "Mr Horne the poet and Mr Browning the poet were not behind in
  approbation," she says in regard to her work on the poets. "Mr Browning
  is said to be learned in Greek, especially the dramatists." In this year
  also she declares her love for Tennyson. To Kenyon she writes, "I ought
  to be thanking you for your great kindness about this divine Tennyson."
  In 1842, moreover, she had the pleasure of a letter from Wordsworth, who
  had twice asked Kenyon for permission to visit her. The visit was not
  permitted on account of Miss Barrett's ill-health. Now Haydon sent her
  his unfinished painting of the great poet musing upon Helvellyn; she
  wrote her sonnet on the portrait, and Haydon sent it to Rydal Mount.
  Wordsworth's commendation is rather cool. In August 1843 "The Cry of the
  Children" appeared in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, and during the year
  she was associated with her friend Horne in a critical work, <i>The New
  Spirit of the Age</i>, rather by advice than by direct contribution. Her
  two volumes of poems (1844) appeared, six years after her former book,
  under the title of <i>Poems, by Elizabeth Barrett Barrett</i>. The
  warmest praises that greeted the new poems were H.F. Chorley's in the
  <i>Athenaeum</i>, John Forster's in the <i>Examiner</i>, and those
  conveyed in <i>Blackwood</i>, the <i>Dublin Review</i>, the <i>New
  Quarterly</i> and the <i>Atlas</i>. Letters came from Carlyle and others.
  Both he and Miss Martineau selected as their favourite poem "Lady
  Geraldine's Courtship," a violent piece of work. In the beginning of the
  following year came the letter from a stranger that was to be so
  momentous to both. "I had a letter from Browning the poet last night,"
  she writes to her old friend Mrs Martin, "which threw me into
  ecstasies&mdash;Browning, the author of <i>Paracelsus</i>, the king of
  the mystics." She is flattered, though not to "ecstasies," at about the
  same time by a letter from E.A. Poe, and by the dedication to her, as
  "the noblest of her sex," of his own work. "What is to be said, I wonder,
  when a man calls you the 'noblest of your sex'? 'Sir, you are the most
  discerning of yours.'" America was at least as quick as England to
  appreciate her poetry; among other messages thence came in the spring
  letters from Lowell and from Mrs Sigourney. "She says that the sound of
  my poetry is stirring the 'deep green forests of the New World'; which
  sounds pleasantly, does it not?" It is in the same year that the letters
  first speak of the hope of a journey to Italy. The winters in London,
  with the imprisonment which&mdash;according to the medical practice of
  that day&mdash;they entailed, were lowering Elizabeth's strength of
  resistance against disease. She longed for the change of light, scene,
  manners and language, and the longing became a hope, until her father's
  prohibition put an end to it, and doomed her, as she and others thought,
  to death, without any perceptible reason for the denial of so reasonable
  a desire.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the friendship with Browning had become the chief thing in
  Elizabeth Barrett's life. The correspondence, once begun, had not
  flagged. In the early summer they met. The allusion to his poetry in
  "Lady Geraldine's Courtship" had doubtless put an edge to his already
  keen wish to know her. He became her frequent visitor and kept her room
  fragrant with flowers. He never lagged, whether in friendship or in love.
  We have the strange privilege, since the publication of the letters
  between the two, of following the whole course of this noble love-story
  from beginning to end, and day by day. Browning was six years younger
  than the woman he so passionately admired, and he at first believed her
  to be confined by some hopeless physical injury to her sofa. But of his
  own wish and resolution he never doubted. Her hesitation, in her regard
  for his liberty and strength, to burden him with an ailing wife, she has
  recorded in the Sonnets afterwards published under a slight disguise as
  <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>. She refused him once "with all her
  will, but much against her heart," and yielded at last for his sake
  rather than her own. Her father's will was that his children should not
  marry, and, kind and affectionate father though he was, the prohibition
  took a violent form and struck terror into the hearts of the three
  dutiful and sensitive girls. Robert Browning's addresses were, therefore,
  kept secret, for fear of scenes of anger which the most fragile of the
  three could not face. Browning was reluctant to practise the deception;
  Elizabeth alone knew how impossible it was to avoid it. When she was
  persuaded to marry, it was she who insisted, in mental and physical
  terror, upon a secret wedding. Throughout the summer of 1846 her health
  improved, and on the 12th of September the two poets were married in St
  Marylebone parish church. Browning visited it on his subsequent journeys
  to England to give thanks for what had taken place at its altar.
  Elizabeth's two sisters had been permitted to know of the engagement, but
  not of the wedding, so that their father's anger might not fall on them
  too heavily. For a week Mrs Browning remained in her father's house. On
  the 19th of September she left it, taking her maid and her little dog,
  joined her husband, and crossed to the Continent. She never entered that
  home again, nor did her father ever forgive her. Her letters, written
  with tears to entreat his pardon, were never answered. They were all
  subsequently returned to her unopened. Among them was one she had
  written, in the prospect of danger, before the birth of her child. With
  her sisters her relations were, as before, most affectionate. Her
  brothers, one at least of whom disapproved of her action, held for a time
  aloof. All others were taken entirely by surprise. Mrs Jameson, who had
  been one of the few intimate visitors to Miss Barrett's room, had offered
  to take her to Italy that year, but met her instead on her way thither
  with a newly-married husband. The poets' journey was full of delight.
  Where she could not walk, up long staircases or across the waters of the
  stream at Vaucluse, Browning carried her. In October they reached Pisa,
  and there they wintered, Mrs Jameson keeping them company for a time lest
  ignorance of practical things should bring them, in their poverty, to
  trouble. She soon found that they were both admirable economists; not
  that they gave time and thought to husbandry, but that they knew how to
  enjoy life without luxuries. So they remained to the end, frugal and
  content with little.</p>

  <p>For climate and cheapness they settled in Italy, choosing Florence in
  the spring of 1847, and remaining there, with the interruptions of a
  change to places in Italy such as Siena and Rome, and to Paris and
  England, until Mrs Browning's death. It was at Pisa that Robert Browning
  first saw the <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>, poems which his wife
  had written in secret and had no thought of publishing. He, however,
  resolved to give them to the world. "I dared not," he said, "reserve to
  myself the finest sonnets written in any language since Shakespeare's."
  The judgment, which the existence of Wordsworth's sonnets renders
  obviously absurd, may be pardoned. The sonnets were sent to Miss Mitford
  and published at Reading, as <i>Sonnets by E.B.B.</i>, in 1847. In 1850
  they were included, under their final title, in a new issue of poems.
  During the Pisan autumn appeared in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> seven
  poems by Mrs Browning which she had sent some time before, and the
  publication of which at that moment disturbed her as likely to hurt her
  father by an apparent reference to her own story. At Pisa also she wrote
  and sent to America a poem, "The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim Point," which
  was published in Boston, in <i>The Liberty Bell</i>, in 1848, and
  separately in England in 1849. In the summer of 1847 the Brownings left
  their temporary dwelling in Florence and took the apartment in Casa
  Guidi, near the Pitti Palace, which was thenceforth their chief home.
  Early in their residence began that excited interest in Italian affairs
  which made so great a part of Mrs Browning's emotional life. The
  Florentines, under the government of the grand duke, were prosperous but
  disturbed by national aspirations. Mrs Browning, by degrees, wrote Casa
  Guidi Windows on their behalf and as an appeal to the always impulsive
  sympathies of England. In 1849 was born <!-- Page 670 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page670"></a>[v.04 p.0670]</span>the Brownings'
  only child, their beloved son Robert Wiedemann Barrett. After this event
  Mrs Browning resumed her literary activities, preparing a new issue, with
  some additions, of her poems (1850). A poem on the death of a friend's
  child appeared in the <i>Athenaeum</i> (1849), and there the new volumes
  were warmly praised. <i>Casa Guidi Windows</i> followed in 1851. Visiting
  England in that year, the Brownings saw much of the Procters, and
  something of Florence Nightingale, Kingsley, Ruskin, Rogers, Patmore and
  Tennyson, and also of Carlyle, with whom they went to Paris, where they
  saw George Sand, and where they passed the December days of the <i>coup
  d'état</i>. Mrs Browning happened to take a political fancy to Napoleon
  III., whom she would probably have denounced if a tithe of his tyrannies
  had occurred in Italy, and the fancy became more emotional in after
  years.</p>

  <p>A new edition of Mrs Browning's poems was called for in 1853, and at
  about this time, in Florence, she began to work on <i>Aurora Leigh</i>.
  She was still writing this poem when the Brownings were again in England,
  in 1855. Tennyson there read to them his newly-written <i>Maud</i>. After
  another interval in Paris they were in London again&mdash;Mrs Browning
  for the last time. She was with her dear cousin Kenyon during the last
  months of his life. In October 1856 the Brownings returned to their
  Florentine home, Mrs Browning leaving her completed <i>Aurora Leigh</i>
  for publication. The book had an immediate success; a second edition was
  required in a fortnight, a third a few months later. In the fourth
  edition (1859) several corrections were made. The review in
  <i>Blackwood</i> was written by W.E. Aytoun, that in the <i>North
  British</i> by Coventry Patmore.</p>

  <p>In 1857 Mrs Browning addressed a petition, in the form of a letter, to
  the emperor Napoleon begging him to remit the sentence of exile upon
  Victor Hugo. We do not hear of any reply. In 1857 Mrs Browning's father
  died, unreconciled. Henrietta Barrett had married, like her sister, and
  like her was unforgiven. In 1858 occurred another visit to Paris, and
  another to Rome, where Hawthorne and his family were among the Brownings'
  friends. In 1859 came the Italian war in which Mrs Browning's hasty
  sympathies were hotly engaged. Her admiration of Italy's champion,
  Napoleon III., knew no bounds, and did not give way when, by the peace of
  Villafranca, Venice and Rome were left unannexed to the kingdom of Italy,
  and the French frontiers were "rectified" by the withdrawal from that
  kingdom of Savoy and Nice. That peace, however, was a bitter
  disappointment, and her fragile health suffered. At Siena and Florence
  this year the Brownings were very kind to Landor, old, solitary, and ill.
  Mrs Browning's poem, "A Tale of Villafranca", was published in the
  <i>Athenaeum</i> in September, and afterwards included in <i>Poems before
  Congress</i> (1860). Then followed another long visit to Rome, and there
  Mrs Browning prepared for the press this, her last volume. The little
  book was judged with some impatience, <i>A Curse for a Nation</i> being
  mistaken for a denunciation of England, whereas it was aimed at America
  and her slavery. The <i>Athenaeum</i>, amongst others, committed this
  error. The <i>Saturday Review</i> was hard on the volume, so was
  <i>Blackwood</i>; the <i>Atlas</i> and <i>Daily News</i> favourable. In
  July 1860 was published "A Musical Instrument" in the young <i>Cornhill
  Magazine</i>, edited by the author's friend W.M. Thackeray. The last blow
  she had to endure was the death of her sister Henrietta, in the same
  year.</p>

  <p>On the 30th of June 1861 Elizabeth Barrett Browning died. Her husband,
  who tended her alone on the night of her decease, wrote to Miss Blagden:
  "Then came what my heart will keep till I see her again and
  longer&mdash;the most perfect expression of her love to me within my
  whole knowledge of her. Always smilingly, happily, and with a face like a
  girl's, and in a few minutes she died in my arms, her head on my cheek.
  ... There was no lingering, nor acute pain, nor consciousness of
  separation, but God took her to himself as you would lift a sleeping
  child from a dark uneasy bed into your arms and the light. Thank God."
  Her married life had been supremely happy. Something has been said of the
  difference between husband and wife in regard to "spiritualism", in which
  Mrs Browning had interest and faith, but no division ever interrupted
  their entirely perfect affection and happiness. Of her husband's love for
  her she wrote at the time of her marriage, "He preferred ... of free and
  deliberate choice, to be allowed to sit only an hour a day by my side, to
  the fulfilment of the brightest dream which should exclude me in any
  possible world." "I am still doubtful whether all the brightness can be
  meant for <i>me</i>. It is just as if the sun rose again at 7 o'clock
  <span class="scac">P.M.</span>" "I take it for pure magic, this life of
  mine. Surely nobody was ever so happy before." "I must say to you [Mrs
  Jameson] who saw the beginning with us, that this end of fifteen months
  is just fifteen times better and brighter; the mystical 'moon' growing
  larger and larger till scarcely room is left for any stars at all: the
  only differences which have touched me being the more and more
  happiness." Browning buried his wife in Florence, under a tomb designed
  by their friend Frederick Leighton. On the wall of Casa Guidi is placed
  the inscription: "Qui scrisse e mori Elisabetta Barrett Browning, che in
  cuore di donna conciliava scienza di dotto e spirito di poeta, e face del
  suo verso aureo annello fra Italia e Inghilterra. Pone questa lapide
  Firenze grata 1861." In 1866 Robert Browning published a volume of
  selections from his wife's works.</p>

  <p>The place of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in English literature is high,
  if not upon the summits. She had an original genius, a fervent heart, and
  an intellect that was, if not great, exceedingly active. She seldom has
  composure or repose, but it is not true that her poetry is purely
  emotional. It is full of abundant, and even over-abundant, thoughts. It
  is intellectually restless. The impassioned peace of the greatest poetry,
  such as Wordsworth's, is not hers. Nor did she apparently seek to attain
  those heights. Her Greek training taught her little of the economy that
  such a poetic education is held to impose; she "dashed", not by reason of
  feminine weakness, but as it were to prove her possession of masculine
  strength. Her gentler work, as in the <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>,
  is beyond praise. There is in her poetic personality a glory of
  righteousness, of spirituality, and of ardour that makes her name a
  splendid one in the history of an incomparable literature.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNING, OSCAR</b> (1837- ), English writer, was born in London on
  the 17th of January 1837, the son of a merchant, William Shipton
  Browning. He was educated at Eton and at King's College, Cambridge, of
  which he became fellow and tutor, graduating fourth in the classical
  tripos of 1860. He was for fifteen years a master at Eton College,
  resuming residence in 1876 at Cambridge, where he became university
  lecturer in history. He soon became a prominent figure in college and
  university life, encouraging especially the study of political science
  and modern political history, the extension of university teaching and
  the movement for the training of teachers. He is well known to Dante
  students by his <i>Dante; Life and Works</i> (1891), and to the study of
  Italian history he has contributed <i>Guelphs and Ghibellines</i> (1903).
  His works on modern history include <i>England and Napoleon in 1803</i>
  (1887), <i>History of England</i> (4 vols. 1890), <i>Wars of the
  Nineteenth Century</i> (1899), <i>History of Europe 1814-1843</i> (1901),
  <i>Napoleon, the first Phase</i> (1905).</p>

  <p><b>BROWNING, ROBERT</b> (1812-1889), English poet, was born at
  Camberwell, London, on the 7th of May 1812. He was the son of Robert
  Browning (1781-1866), who for fifty years was employed in the Bank of
  England. Earlier Brownings had been settled in Wiltshire and Dorsetshire,
  and there is no ground for the statement that the family was partly of
  Jewish origin. The poet's mother was a daughter of William Wiedemann, a
  German who had settled in Dundee and married a Scottish wife. His parents
  had one other child, a daughter, Sarianna, born in 1814. They lived
  quietly in Camberwell. The elder Browning <!-- Page 671 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page671"></a>[v.04 p.0671]</span>had a
  sufficient income and was indifferent to money-making. He had strong
  literary and artistic tastes. He was an ardent book collector, and so
  good a draughtsman that paternal authority alone had prevented him from
  adopting an artistic career. He had, like his son, a singular faculty for
  versifying, and helped the boy's early lessons by twisting the Latin
  grammar into grotesque rhymes. He lived, as his father had done, to be
  84, with unbroken health. The younger Robert inherited, along with other
  characteristics, much of his father's vigour of constitution. From the
  mother, who had delicate health, he probably derived his excessive
  nervous irritability; and from her, too, came his passion for music. The
  family was united by the strongest mutual affection, and the parents
  erred, if anything, on the side of indulgence. Browning was sent to a
  school in the neighbourhood, but left it when fourteen, and had little
  other teaching. He had a French tutor for the next two years, and in his
  eighteenth year he attended some Greek lectures at the London University.
  At school he never won a prize, though it was more difficult to avoid
  than to win prizes. He was more conspicuous for the love of birds and
  beasts, which he always retained, than for any interest in his lessons.
  He rather despised his companions and made few friends. A precocious
  poetical capacity, however, showed itself in extra-scholastic ways. He
  made his schoolfellows act plays, partly written by himself. He had
  composed verses before he could write, and when twelve years old
  completed a volume of poems called <i>Incondita</i>. His parents tried
  unsuccessfully to find a publisher; but his verses were admired by Sarah
  Flower, afterwards Mrs Adams, a well-known hymn-writer of the day, and by
  W.J. Fox, both of whom became valuable friends. A copy made by Miss
  Flower was in existence in 1871, but afterwards destroyed by the author.
  Browning had the run of his father's library, and acquired a very unusual
  amount of miscellaneous reading. Quarles' <i>Emblems</i> was an especial
  favourite; and besides the Elizabethan dramatists and standard English
  books, he had read all the works of Voltaire. Byron was his first master
  in poetry, but about the age of fourteen he fell in accidentally with
  Shelley and Keats. For Shelley in particular he conceived an <span
  class="correction" title="'enthusiatic' in original">enthusiastic</span>
  admiration which lasted for many years, though it was qualified in his
  later life.</p>

  <p>The more aggressive side of Browning's character was as yet the most
  prominent; and a self-willed lad, conscious of a growing ability, found
  himself cramped in Camberwell circles. He rejected the ordinary careers.
  He declined the offer of a clerkship in the Bank of England; and his
  father, who had found the occupation uncongenial, not only approved the
  refusal but cordially accepted the son's decision to take poetry for his
  profession. For good or evil, Browning had been left very much to his own
  guidance, and if his intellectual training suffered in some directions,
  the liberty permitted the development of his marked originality. The
  parental yoke, however, was too light to provoke rebellion. Browning's
  mental growth led to no violent breach with the creeds of his childhood.
  His parents became Dissenters in middle life, but often attended Anglican
  services; and Browning, though he abandoned the dogmas, continued to
  sympathize with the spirit of their creed. He never took a keen interest
  in the politics of the day, but cordially accepted the general position
  of contemporary Liberalism. His worship of Shelley did not mean an
  acceptance of his master's hostile attitude towards Christianity, still
  less did he revolt against the moral discipline under which he had been
  educated. He frequented literary and artistic circles, and was
  passionately fond of the theatre; but he was entirely free from a coarse
  Bohemianism, and never went to bed, we are told, without kissing his
  mother. He lived with his parents until his marriage. His mother lived
  till 1849, and his father till 1866, and his affectionate relations to
  both remained unaltered. Browning's first published poem, <i>Pauline</i>,
  appeared anonymously in 1833. He always regarded it as crude, and
  destroyed all the copies of this edition that came within his reach. It
  was only to avoid unauthorized reprints that he consented with reluctance
  to republishing it in the collected works of 1868. The indication of
  genius was recognized by W.J. Fox, who hailed it in the <i>Monthly
  Repository</i> as marking the advent of a true poet. <i>Pauline</i>
  contains an enthusiastic invocation of Shelley, whose influence upon its
  style and conception is strongly marked. It is the only one of Browning's
  works which can be regarded as imitative. In the winter of 1833 he went
  to St Petersburg on a visit to the Russian consul-general, Mr
  Benckhausen. There he wrote the earliest of his dramatic lyrics,
  "Porphyria's Lover" and "Johannes Agricola." In the spring of 1834 he
  visited Italy for the first time, going to Venice and Asolo.</p>

  <p>Browning's personality was fully revealed in his next considerable
  poems, <i>Paracelsus</i> (1835) and <i>Sordello</i> (1840). With
  <i>Pauline</i>, however, they form a group. In an essay (prefixed to the
  spurious Shelley letters of 1851), Browning describes Shelley's poetry
  "as a sublime fragmentary essay towards a presentment of the
  correspondency of the universe to Deity." The phrase describes his own
  view of the true functions of a poet, and Browning, having accepted the
  vocation, was meditating the qualifications which should fit him for his
  task. The hero of <i>Pauline</i> is in a morbid state of mind which
  endangers his fidelity to his duty. <i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Sordello</i>
  are studies in the psychology of genius, illustrating its besetting
  temptations. Paracelsus fails from intellectual pride, not balanced by
  love of his kind, and from excessive ambition, which leads him to seek
  success by unworthy means. Sordello is a poet distracted between the
  demands of a dreamy imagination and the desire to utter the thoughts of
  mankind. He finally gives up poetry for practical politics, and gets into
  perplexities only to be solved by his death. <i>Pauline</i> might in some
  indefinite degree reflect Browning's own feelings, but in the later poems
  he adopts his characteristic method of speaking in a quasi-dramatic mood.
  They are, as he gave notice, "poems, not dramas." The interest is not in
  the external events, but in the "development of a soul"; but they are
  observations of other men's souls, not direct revelations of his own.
  Paracelsus was based upon a study of the original narrative, and Sordello
  was a historical though a very indefinite person. The background of
  history is intentionally vague in both cases. There is one remarkable
  difference between them. The <i>Paracelsus</i>, though full of noble
  passages, is certainly diffuse. Browning heard that John Sterling had
  complained of its "verbosity," and tried to remedy this failing by the
  surgical expedient of cutting out the usual connecting words. Relative
  pronouns henceforth become scarce in his poetry, and the grammatical
  construction often a matter of conjecture. Words are forcibly jammed
  together instead of being articulately combined. To the ordinary reader
  many passages in his later work are both crabbed and obscure, but the
  "obscurity" never afterwards reached the pitch of <i>Sordello</i>. It is
  due to the vagueness with which the story is rather hinted than told, as
  well as to the subtlety and intricacy of the psychological expositions.
  The subtlety and vigour of the thought are indeed surprising, and may
  justify the frequent comparisons to Shakespeare; and it abounds in
  descriptive passages of genuine poetry.</p>

  <p>Still, Browning seems to have been misled by a fallacy. It was quite
  legitimate to subordinate the external incidents to the psychological
  development in which he was really interested, but to secure the
  subordination by making the incidents barely intelligible was not a
  logical consequence. We should not understand Hamlet's psychological
  peculiarities the better if we had to infer his family troubles from
  indirect hints. Browning gave more time to <i>Sordello</i> than to any
  other work, and perhaps had become so familiar with the story which he
  professed to tell that he failed to make allowance for his readers'
  difficulties. In any case it was not surprising that the ordinary reader
  should be puzzled and repelled, and the general recognition of his genius
  long delayed, by his reputation for obscurity.</p>

  <p>It might, however, be expected that he would make a more successful
  appeal to the public by purely dramatic work, in which he would have to
  limit his psychological speculation and to place his characters in plain
  situations. <i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Sordello</i> show so great a power
  of reading character and appreciating subtler springs of conduct that its
  author clearly had one, at least, of the essential qualifications of a
  dramatist.</p>

<p><!-- Page 672 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page672"></a>[v.04 p.0672]</span></p>

  <p>Before <i>Sordello</i> appeared Browning had tried his hand in this
  direction. He was encouraged by outward circumstances as well as by his
  natural bent. He was making friends and gaining some real appreciative
  admirers. John Forster had been greatly impressed by <i>Paracelsus</i>.
  Browning's love of the theatre had led to an introduction to Macready in
  the winter of 1835-1836; and Macready, who had been also impressed by
  <i>Paracelsus</i>, asked him for a play. Browning consented and wrote
  <i>Strafford</i>, which was produced at Covent Garden in May 1837,
  Macready taking the principal part. Later dramas were <i>King Victor and
  King Charles</i>, published in 1842; <i>The Return of the Druses</i> and
  <i>A Blot on the 'Scutcheon</i> (both in 1843), <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>
  (1844), <i>Luria</i> and <i>A Soul's Tragedy</i> (both in 1846), and the
  fragmentary <i>In a Balcony</i> (1853). <i>Strafford</i> succeeded
  fairly, though the defection of Vandenhoff, who took the part of Pym,
  stopped its run after the fifth performance. The <i>Blot on the
  'Scutcheon</i>, produced by Macready as manager of Drury Lane on the 11th
  of February 1843, led to an unfortunate quarrel. Browning thought that
  Macready had felt unworthy jealousy of another actor, and had gratified
  his spite by an inadequate presentation of the play. He remonstrated
  indignantly and the friendship was broken off for years. Browning was
  disgusted by his experience of the annoyances of practical play-writing,
  though he was not altogether discouraged. The play had apparently such a
  moderate success as was possible under the conditions, and a similar
  modest result was attained by <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>, produced at
  Covent Garden on the 25th of April 1853. Browning, like other eminent
  writers of the day, failed to achieve the feat of attracting the British
  public by dramas of high literary aims, and soon gave up the attempt. It
  has been said by competent critics that some of the plays could be fitted
  for the stage by judicious adaptation. The <i>Blot on the 'Scutcheon</i>
  has a very clear and forcibly treated situation; and all the plays abound
  in passages of high poetic power. Like the poems, they deal with
  situations involving a moral probation of the characters, and often
  suggesting the ethical problems which always interested him. The speeches
  tend to become elaborate analyses of motive by the persons concerned, and
  try the patience of an average audience. For whatever reason, Browning,
  though he had given sufficient proofs of genius, had not found in these
  works the most appropriate mode of utterance.</p>

  <p>The dramas, after <i>Strafford</i>, formed the greatest part of a
  series of pamphlets called <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>, eight of which
  were issued from 1841 to 1846. The name, he explained, was intended to
  indicate an "alternation of poetry and thought." The first number
  contained the fanciful and characteristic <i>Pippa Passes</i>. The
  seventh, significantly named <i>Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</i>,
  contained some of his most striking shorter poems. In 1844 he contributed
  six poems, among which were "The Flight of the Duchess" and "The Bishop
  orders his Tomb at St Praxed's Church," to Hood's <i>Magazine</i>, in
  order to help Hood, then in his last illness. These poems take the
  special form in which Browning is unrivalled. He wrote very few lyrical
  poems of the ordinary kind purporting to give a direct expression of his
  own personal emotions. But, in the lyric which gives the essential
  sentiment of some impressive dramatic situation, he has rarely been
  approached. There is scarcely one of the poems published at this time
  which can be read without fixing itself at once in the memory as a
  forcible and pungent presentation of a characteristic mood. Their vigour
  and originality failed to overcome at once the presumption against the
  author of <i>Sordello</i>. Yet Browning was already known to and
  appreciated by such literary celebrities of the day as Talfourd, Leigh
  Hunt, Procter, Monckton Milnes, Carlyle and Landor. His fame began to
  spread among sympathetic readers. The <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>
  attracted the rising school of "pre-Raphaelites," especially D.G.
  Rossetti, who guessed the authorship of the anonymous <i>Pauline</i> and
  made a transcript from the copy in the British Museum. But his audience
  was still select.</p>

  <p>Another recognition of his genius was of incomparably more personal
  importance and vitally affected his history. In 1844 Miss Barrett (see
  <span class="sc">Browning, Elizabeth Barrett</span>) published a volume
  of poems containing "Lady Geraldine's Courtship," with a striking phrase
  about Browning's poems. He was naturally gratified, and her special
  friend and cousin, John Kenyon, encouraged him to write to her. She
  admitted him to a personal interview after a little diffidence, and a
  hearty appreciation of literary genius on both sides was speedily ripened
  into genuine and most devoted love. Miss Barrett was six years older than
  Browning and a confirmed invalid with shaken nerves. She was tenderly
  attached to an autocratic father who objected on principle to the
  marriage of his children. The correspondence of the lovers (published in
  1899) shows not only their mutual devotion, but the chivalrous delicacy
  with which Browning behaved in a most trying situation. Miss Barrett was
  gradually encouraged to disobey the utterly unreasonable despotism. They
  made a clandestine marriage on the 12th of September 1846. The state of
  Miss Barrett's health suggested misgivings which made Browning's parents
  as well as his bride's disapprove of the match. She, however, appears to
  have become stronger for some time, though always fragile and incapable
  of much active exertion. She had already been recommended to pass a
  winter in Italy. Browning had made three previous tours there, and his
  impressions had been turned to account in <i>Sordello</i> and <i>Pippa
  Passes</i>, in <i>The Englishman in Italy</i> and <i>Home Thoughts from
  Abroad</i>. For the next fifteen years the Brownings lived mainly in
  Italy, making their headquarters at Florence in the Casa Guidi. A couple
  of winters were passed in Rome. In the summer of 1849 they were at Siena,
  where Browning was helpful to Landor, then in his last domestic troubles.
  They also visited England and twice spent some months in Paris. Their
  only child, Robert Wiedemann Browning, was born at Florence in 1849.
  Browning's literary activity during his marriage seems to have been
  comparatively small; <i>Christmas Eve and Easter Day</i> appeared in
  1850, while the two volumes called <i>Men and Women</i> (1855),
  containing some of his best work, showed that his power was still
  growing. His position involved some sacrifice and imposed limitations
  upon his energies. Mrs Browning's health required a secluded life; and
  Browning, it is said, never dined out during his marriage, though he
  enjoyed society and made many and very warm friendships. Among their
  Florence friends were Margaret Fuller Ossoli, Isa Blagden, Charles Lever
  and others. The only breach of complete sympathy with his wife was due to
  his contempt for "spiritualists" and "mediums," in whom she fully
  believed. His portrait of Daniel Dunglas Home as "Sludge the Medium" only
  appeared after her death. This domestic happiness, however, remained
  essentially unbroken until she died on 29th June 1861. The whole
  love-story had revealed the singular nobility of his character, and,
  though crushed for a time by the blow, he bore it manfully. Browning
  determined to return to England and superintend his boy's education at
  home. He took a house at 19 Warwick Crescent, Paddington, and became
  gradually acclimatized in London. He resumed his work and published the
  <i>Dramatis Personae</i> in 1864. The publication was well enough
  received to mark the growing recognition of his genius, which was
  confirmed by <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, published in four volumes in
  the winter of 1868-1869. In 1867 the university of Oxford gave him the
  degree of M.A. "by diploma," and Balliol College elected him as an
  honorary fellow. In 1868 he declined a virtual offer of the rectorship of
  St Andrews. He repeated the refusal on a later occasion (1884) from a
  dislike to the delivery of a public address. The rising generation was
  now beginning to buy his books; and he shared the homage of thoughtful
  readers with Tennyson, though in general popularity he could not approach
  his friendly rival. <i>The Ring and the Book</i> has been generally
  accepted as Browning's masterpiece. It was based on a copy of the
  <i>procès verbal</i> of Guido Franceschini's case discovered by him at
  Florence.</p>

  <p>The audacity of the scheme is surprising. To tell the story of a
  hideous murder twelve times over, to versify the arguments of counsel and
  the gossip of quidnuncs, and to insist upon every detail with the
  minuteness of a law report, could have occurred to no one else. The poem
  is so far at the opposite pole from <i>Sordello</i>. Vagueness of
  environment is replaced by a photographic <!-- Page 673 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page673"></a>[v.04 p.0673]</span>distinctness,
  though the psychological interest is dominant in both. Particular phrases
  may be crabbed, but nothing can be more distinct and vivid in thought and
  conception. If some of those "dramatic monologues" of which the book is
  formed fail to be poetry at all, some of them&mdash;that of Pompilia the
  victim, her champion Caponsacchi, and the pope who gives
  judgment&mdash;are in Browning's highest mood, and are as impressive from
  the ethical as from the poetical point of view. Pompilia was no doubt in
  some respects an idealized portrait of Mrs Browning. Other pieces may be
  accepted as a background of commonplace to throw the heroic into the
  stronger relief. <i>The Ring and the Book</i> is as powerful as its
  method is unique.</p>

  <p>Browning became gentler and more urbane as he grew older. His growing
  fame made him welcome in all cultivated circles, and he accepted the
  homage of his admirers with dignity and simplicity. He exerted himself to
  be agreeable in private society, though his nervousness made him
  invariably decline ever to make public speeches. He was an admirable
  talker, and took pains to talk his best. A strong memory supplied him
  with abundant anecdotes; and though occasionally pugnacious, he allowed a
  fair share of the conversation to his companions. Superficial observers
  sometimes fancied that the poet was too much sunk in the man of the
  world; but the appearance was due to his characteristic reluctance to lay
  bare his deeper feelings. When due occasion offered, the underlying
  tenderness of his affections was abundantly manifest. No one could show
  more delicate sympathy. He made many warm personal friendships in his
  later years, especially with women, to whom he could most easily confide
  his feelings. In the early years of this period he paid visits to country
  houses, but afterwards preferred to retire farther from the London
  atmosphere into secluded regions. He passed some holidays in remote
  French villages, Pornic, Le Croisic and St Aubyn, which have left traces
  in his poetry. <i>Gold Hair</i> is a legend of Pornic, and <i>Hervé
  Riel</i> was written at Le Croisic. At St Aubyn he had the society of
  Joseph Milsand, who had shown his warm appreciation of Browning's poetry
  by an article in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, which in 1852 had led
  to a personal friendship lasting till Milsand's death in 1886. Browning
  sent to him the proof-sheets of all his later works for revision. In 1877
  Browning was at La Saisiaz on the Salève, near Geneva, where an old
  friend, Miss Egerton Smith, was staying. She died suddenly almost in his
  presence. She had constantly accompanied him to concerts during his
  London life. After her death he almost ceased to care for music. The
  shock of her loss produced the singular poem called <i>La Saisiaz</i>, in
  which he argues the problem of personal immortality with a rather
  indefinite conclusion. In later years Browning returned to Italy, and
  passed several autumns at Venice. He never visited Florence after his
  wife's death there.</p>

  <p>Browning's literary activity continued till almost the end of his
  life. He wrote constantly, though he composed more slowly. He considered
  twenty-five or thirty lines to be a good day's work. His later writings
  covered a very great variety of subjects, and were cast in many different
  forms. They show the old characteristics and often the old genius.
  Browning's marked peculiarity, the union of great speculative acuteness
  with intense poetical insight, involved difficulties which he did not
  always surmount. He does not seem to know whether he is writing poetry or
  when he is versifying logic; and when the speculative impulse gets the
  upper hand, his work suggests the doubt whether an imaginary dialogue in
  prose would not have been a more effective medium. He is analysing at
  length when he ought to be presenting a concrete type, while the
  necessities of verse complicate and obscure the reasoning. A curious
  example is the <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i> (1871), an <i>alias</i>
  for Louis Napoleon. The attempt to show how a questionable hero
  apologizes to himself recalls the very powerful "Bishop Blougram," and
  "Sludge, the medium," of earlier works, but becomes prolix and obscure.
  <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> (1872) is another curious speculation
  containing a defence of versatility in lovemaking by an imaginary Don
  Juan. Its occasionally cynical tone rather scandalized admirers, who
  scarcely made due allowance for its dramatic character. Browning's
  profound appreciation of high moral qualities is, however, always one
  main source of his power. In later years he became especially interested
  in stories of real life, which show character passing through some sharp
  ordeal. The <i>Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i> (1873), describing a
  strange tragedy which had recently taken place in France, and especially
  <i>The Inn Album</i> (1875), founded on an event in modern English
  society, are powerful applications of the methods already exemplified in
  <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. The <i>Dramatic Idyls</i> (1879 and 1880)
  are a collection of direct narratives, with less analytical disquisition,
  which surprised his readers by their sustained vigour. In the last
  volumes, <i>Jocoseria</i> (1883), <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> (1884),
  <i>Parleying with Certain People</i> (1887) and <i>Asolando</i> (1889),
  the old power is still apparent but the hand is beginning to fail. They
  contain discussions of metaphysical problems, such as the origin of evil,
  which are interesting as indications of his creed, but can scarcely be
  regarded as successful either poetically or philosophically.</p>

  <p>Another group of poems showed Browning's interest in Greek literature.
  <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> (1871) includes a "transcript from
  Euripides," a translation, that is, of part of the <i>Alcestis</i>.
  <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> (1875) included another translation from the
  <i>Heracles</i>, and in 1877 he published a very literal translation of
  the <i>Agamemnon</i>. This, it seems, was meant to disprove the doctrine
  that Æschylus was a model of literary style. Browning shared his wife's
  admiration for Euripides, and takes a phrase from one of her poems as a
  motto for <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i>. In the <i>Aristophanes'
  Apology</i> this leads characteristically to a long exposition by
  Aristophanes of his unsatisfactory reasons for ridiculing Euripides. It
  recalls the apologies of "Blougram" and Louis Napoleon, and contains some
  interesting indications of his poetical theory. Browning was to many
  readers as much prophet as poet. His religious position is most
  explicitly, though still not very clearly, set forth in the <i>Christmas
  Eve and Easter Day</i> (1850). Like many eminent contemporaries, he
  combined a disbelief in orthodox dogma with a profound conviction of the
  importance to the religious instincts of the symbols incorporated in
  accepted creeds. <i>Saul</i> (1845), <i>A Death in the Desert</i> (1864),
  and similar poems, show his strong sympathy with the spirit of the old
  belief, though his argumentative works have a more or less sceptical
  turn. It was scarcely possible, if desirable, to be original on such
  topics. His admirers hold that he shows an affinity to German
  metaphysicians, though he had never read their works nor made any express
  study of metaphysical questions. His distinctive tendency is to be found
  rather in the doctrine of life and conduct which both suggests and is
  illustrated by his psychological analyses. A very characteristic thought
  emphatically set forth in the <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> (1864) and the
  <i>Grammarian's Funeral</i> (1855) is that a man's value is to be
  measured, not by the work done, but by the character which has been
  moulded. He delights in exhibiting the high moral instinct which dares to
  override ordinary convictions, or which is content with discharge of
  obscure duties, or superior to vulgar ambition and capable of
  self-sacrifice, because founded upon pure love and sympathy for human
  suffering. Browning's limitations are characteristic of the poetry of
  strong ethical preoccupations. His strong idiosyncrasy, his sympathy with
  the heroic and hatred of the base, was hardly to be combined with the
  Shakespearian capacity for sympathizing with the most varied types of
  character. Though he deals with a great variety of motive with singularly
  keen analysis, he takes almost exclusively the moral point of view. That
  point of view, however, has its importance, and his morality is often
  embodied in poetry of surpassing force. Browning's love of the grotesque,
  sometimes even of the horrible, creates many most graphic and indelible
  portraits. The absence of an exquisite sense for the right word is
  compensated by the singular power of striking the most brilliant flashes
  out of obviously wrong words, and forcing comic rhymes to express the
  deepest and most serious thoughts. Though he professed to care little for
  motive as apart from human interest, his incidental touches of
  description are unsurpassably vivid.</p>

  <p>The appreciation of Browning's genius became general in his later
  years, and zeal was perhaps a little heightened by the complacency of
  disciples able to penetrate a supposed mist of obscurity. The Browning
  Society, founded in 1881 by Dr F.J. Furnivall and Miss E.H. Hickey, was a
  product of this appreciation, and helped to extend the study of the
  poems. Browning accepted the homage in a simple and friendly way, though
  he avoided any action which would make him responsible for the
  publications. He received various honours: LL.D. degree from Cambridge in
  1879, the D.C.L. from Oxford in 1882, and LL.D. from Edinburgh in 1884.
  He became foreign correspondent to the Royal Academy in 1886. His son,
  who had settled at Venice, married in 1887, and Browning moved to De Vere
  Gardens. In the autumn of 1889 he went with his sister to visit his son,
  and stayed on the way at Asolo, which he had first seen in 1838, when it
  supplied the scenery of <i>Pippa Passes</i>. He was charmed with the
  place, and proposed to buy a piece of ground and to build upon it a house
  to be called "Pippa's Tower"&mdash;in memory of his early heroine. While
  his proposal was under consideration he went to his son at Venice. His
  health had been breaking for some time, and a cold, aggravated by
  weakness of the heart, brought on a fatal attack. He died on the 12th of
  December 1889. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 31st December. It
  was suggested that his wife's body should be removed from Florence to be
  placed beside him; but their son rightly decided that her grave should
  not be disturbed.</p>

  <p>Browning's personal characteristics are so strongly stamped upon all
  his works that it is difficult to assign his place in contemporary
  thought. He is unique and outside of all schools. His style is so
  peculiar that he is the easiest of all poets to parody and the most
  dangerous to imitate. In spite of his early Shelley worship he is in
  certain respects more closely related to Wordsworth. Both of them started
  by accepting the poet's mission as quasi-prophetical or ethical. In other
  respects they are diametrically contrasted. Wordsworth expounded his
  philosophy by writing a poetical autobiography. Browning adheres to the
  dramatic method of which Wordsworth was utterly incapable. He often
  protested against the supposition that he put himself into his books. Yet
  there is no writer whose books seem to readers to be clearer revelations
  of himself. Nothing, in fact, is more characteristic of a man than his
  judgments of other men, and Browning's are keen and unequivocal. The
  revolutionary impulse had died out, and Browning has little to say either
  of the political questions which had moved Shelley and Byron, or of the
  social problems which have lately become more prominent. He represents
  the thought of a quieter epoch. He was little interested, too, in the
  historical or "romantic" aspect of life. He takes his subjects from a
  great variety of scenes and places&mdash;from ancient Greece, medieval
  Italy and modern France and England; but the interest for him is not in
  the picturesque surroundings, but in the human being who is to be found
  in all periods. Like Balzac, whom he always greatly admired, he is
  interested in the eternal tragedy and comedy of life. His problem is
  always to show what are the really noble elements which are eternally
  valuable in spite of failure to achieve tangible results. He gives, so
  far, another version of Wordsworth's doctrine of the cultivation of the
  "moral being." The psychological acuteness and the subtle analysis of
  character are, indeed, peculiar to himself. Like Carlyle, with whom he
  had certain points of affinity, he protests, though rather by implication
  than direct denunciation, against the utilitarian or materialistic view
  of life, and finds the divine element in the instincts which guide and
  animate every noble character. When he is really inspired by sympathy for
  such emotions he can make his most grotesque fancies and his most
  far-fetched analyses subservient to poetry of the highest order. It can
  hardly be denied that his intellectual ingenuity often tempts him to
  deviate from his true function, and that his observations are not to be
  excused because they result from an excess, instead of a deficiency, of
  intellectual acuteness. But the variety of his interests&mdash;aesthetic,
  philosophical and ethical&mdash;is astonishing, and his successes are
  poems which stand out as unique and unsurpassable in the literature of
  his time.</p>

  <p><b>BROWN-SÉQUARD, CHARLES EDWARD</b> (1817-1894), British physiologist
  and neurologist, was born at Port Louis, Mauritius, on the 8th of April
  1817. His father was an American and his mother a Frenchwoman, but he
  himself always desired to be looked upon as a British subject, though in
  the restlessness of his life and the enthusiasm of his disposition,
  characteristics of his mother's nation were plainly visible. After
  graduating in medicine at Paris in 1846 he returned to Mauritius with the
  intention of practising there, but in 1852 he went to America.
  Subsequently he returned to Paris, and in 1859 he migrated to London,
  becoming physician to the national hospital for the paralysed and
  epileptic. There he stayed for about five years, expounding his views on
  the pathology of the nervous system in numerous lectures which attracted
  considerable attention. In 1864 he again crossed the Atlantic, and was
  appointed professor of physiology and neuro-pathology at Harvard. This
  position he relinquished in 1867, and in 1869 became professor at the
  École de Médecine in Paris, but in 1873 he again returned to America and
  began to practise in New York. Finally, he went back to Paris to succeed
  Claude Bernard in 1878 as professor of experimental medicine in the
  Collège de France, and he remained there till his death, which occurred
  on the 2nd of April 1894 at Sceaux. Brown-Séquard was a keen observer and
  experimentalist. He contributed largely to our knowledge of the blood and
  animal heat, as well as many facts of the highest importance on the
  nervous system. He was the first scientist to work out the physiology of
  the spinal cord, demonstrating that the decussation of the sensory fibres
  is in the cord itself. He also did valuable work on the internal
  secretion of organs, the results of which have been applied with the most
  satisfactory results in the treatment of myxoedema. Unfortunately in his
  extreme old age, he advocated the hypodermic injection of a fluid
  prepared from the testicles of sheep, as a means of prolonging human
  life. It was known, among scientists, derisively, as the Brown-Séquard
  Elixir. His researches, published in about 500 essays and papers,
  especially in the <i>Archives de Physiologie</i>, which he helped to
  found in 1868, cover a very wide range of physiological and pathological
  subjects.</p>

  <p><b>BROWNSON, ORESTES AUGUSTUS</b> (1803-1876), American theological,
  philosophical and sociological writer, was born in Stockbridge, Vermont,
  on the 16th of September 1803. Having spent some time in active
  religious, reformatory and political (Democratic) work in the interior of
  New York state, and at Walpole, New Hampshire, and Canton, Massachusetts,
  Brownson removed in 1839 to Chelsea, Mass. He at once began to take an
  independent part in the movements then agitating New England, which
  between 1830 and 1850 was stirred by discussions pertaining to
  Unitarianism, transcendentalism, spiritualism, abolitionism and various
  schemes for communistic living. He was one of the founders, in New York,
  of the short-lived Workingman's party in 1828, and established the
  <i>Boston Quarterly Review</i>, mainly written by himself, in 1838. This
  periodical was merged in the <i>U.S. Democratic Review</i> of New York in
  1842. <!-- Page 675 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page675"></a>[v.04
  p.0675]</span>In religion he first became a Presbyterian (1822); was a
  Universalist minister from 1826 to 1831, editing for some time the chief
  journal of this church, the <i>Gospel Advocate</i>; was an independent
  preacher at Ithaca, N.Y., in 1831; became a Unitarian minister in 1832,
  and in 1836 organized in Boston the Society for Christian Union and
  Progress, of which he was the pastor for seven years. In 1844 he became a
  Roman Catholic and so remained, though the question of the orthodoxy of
  his writings was at one time submitted by the pope to Cardinal Franzelin,
  who recommended Brownson, to little purpose, to express his views with
  more moderation. In his philosophy Brownson was a more or less
  independent follower of Comte for a short time, and of Victor Cousin,
  who, in his <i>Fragmens philosophiques</i>, praised him; he may be said
  to have taught a modified intuitionalism. In his schemes for social
  reform he was at first a student of Robert Owen, until his later views
  led him to accept Roman Catholicism. His first quarterly was followed, in
  1844, by <i>Brownson's Quarterly Review</i> (first published in Boston
  and after 1855 in New York), in which he expressed his opinions on many
  themes until its suspension in 1864, and after its revival for a brief
  period in 1873-1875. Of his numerous publications in book form, the chief
  during his lifetime were <i>Charles Elwood, or the Infidel Converted</i>
  (1840, autobiographical), in which he strongly favoured the Roman
  Catholic Church; and <i>The American Republic: its Constitution,
  Tendencies and Destiny</i> (1865), in which he based government on
  ethics, declaring the national existence to be a moral and even a
  theocratic entity, not depending for validity upon the sovereignty of the
  people. Brownson died in Detroit, Michigan, on the 17th of April
  1876.</p>

  <p>After his death, his son, Henry F. Brownson, collected and published
  his various political, religious, philosophical, scientific and literary
  writings, in twenty octavo volumes (Detroit, 1883-1887), of which a
  condensed summary appeared in a single volume, also prepared by his son,
  entitled <i>Literary and Political Views</i> (New York, 1893). The son
  also published a biography in three volumes (Detroit, 1898-1900).</p>

  <p>His daughter, Sarah M. Brownson (1839-1876), who married in 1873
  William J. Tenney, was the author of several novels, and wrote a <i>Life
  of Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, Prince and Priest</i> (1873).</p>

  <p><b>BROWNSVILLE,</b> a city and the county-seat of Cameron county,
  Texas, U.S.A., situated near the S. extremity of the state, on the Rio
  Grande river about 22 m. above its mouth, and opposite Matamoras, Mexico.
  Pop. (1890) 6134; (1900) 6305, including 2462 foreign-born and 18
  negroes; (1910) 10,517. It is served by the St Louis, Brownsville &amp;
  Mexico, and the Rio Grande railways, being connected by the former with
  Houston and Galveston and by the latter with Point Isabel on the Gulf
  coast. Its chief importance lies in its being the commercial and
  distributing centre for a rich and extensive agricultural region in
  southern Texas and northern Mexico, and an important market for rice,
  sugar-cane, fruit, vegetables and live-stock. It has a United States
  custom house, the Cameron county court house, a Roman Catholic cathedral,
  St Joseph's College (Roman Catholic), and the Incarnate Word Academy
  (Roman Catholic). Before the Mexican War there was a small Mexican
  settlement on the site of Brownsville. In March 1846 General Zachary
  Taylor erected fortifications here, and upon his withdrawal to Point
  Isabel, left a small garrison in command of Major Jacob Brown. The fort
  was assaulted by General Arista and shelled by batteries from the Mexican
  shore, and at last on the 10th of May was relieved by General Taylor, who
  in advancing to its aid had won the battles of Palo Alto (8th of May) and
  Resaca de la Palma (9th of May). The fort, originally named Fort Taylor,
  was renamed Fort Brown, by order of General Taylor, in memory of Major
  Brown, who was mortally wounded during the bombardment. In 1859
  Brownsville was captured by a band of Mexican raiders under Juan
  Nepomuceno Cortina. During the Civil War, until its temporary occupation
  by Federal forces in 1863, and subsequent effective blockade, it was an
  active centre of operations of Confederate blockade runners. At Palmetto
  Ranch, near the battlefield of Palo Alto, took place (13th of May 1865),
  more than a month after General Lee's surrender, the last engagement
  between Federal and Confederate troops in the Civil War. In Brownsville,
  on the night of the 13th of August 1906, certain persons unknown fired
  into houses and at citizens on the streets, killing one man and injuring
  two. Suspicion pointed to negro soldiers of Companies B, C and D of the
  25th Infantry, stationed at Fort Brown, and as it appeared that the
  culprits were being shielded by their comrades by a "conspiracy of
  silence," President Roosevelt dismissed the 170 men of the three
  companies "without honor." Both in Congress and in the press a bitter
  attack was made on the president for his action. In 1907 the military
  reservation of Fort Brown was transferred to the Department of
  Agriculture. In March 1909 Congress provided for a commission of army
  officers to report as to the eligibility of members of the negro
  regiments for re-enlistment.</p>

  <p><b>BRUAY,</b> a town of northern France, in the department of
  Pas-de-Calais, on the Lawe, 19 m. N.N.W. of Arras by road. Pop. (1906)
  16,169. The town is situated in a rich coal-mining district. Brewing is
  also a leading industry.</p>

  <p><b>BRUCE,</b> the name of an old Scottish family of Norman descent,
  taken from Bruis between Cherbourg and Vallonges. Variations of the name
  are Braose, Breaux and Brus. The first Robert de Brus, a follower of
  William the Conqueror, was rewarded by the gift of many manors, chiefly
  in Yorkshire, of which Skelton was the principal. His son, the second
  Robert, received from David I., his comrade at the court of Henry I., a
  grant of the lordship of Annandale. The fourth Robert married Isabel,
  natural daughter of William the Lion, and their son, the fifth Robert,
  married Isabel, second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon, niece of
  the same Scottish king. The most famous member of the family is the
  eighth Robert, "the Bruce," who became king of Scotland in 1306. (See
  <span class="sc">Robert the Bruce</span>.)</p>

  <p><b>BRUCE, ALEXANDER BALMAIN</b> (1831-1899), Scottish divine, was born
  at Aberargie near Perth on the 31st of January 1831. His father suffered
  for his adherence to the Free Church at the Disruption in 1843, and
  removed to Edinburgh, where the son was educated, showing exceptional
  ability from the first. His early religious doubts, awakened especially
  by Strauss's <i>Life of Jesus</i>, made him throughout life sympathetic
  with those who underwent a similar stress. After serving as assistant
  first at Ancrum, then at Lochwinnoch, he was called to Cardross in
  Dumbartonshire in 1859, and to Broughty Ferry in 1868. There he published
  his first considerable exegetical work, the <i>Training of the
  Twelve</i>. In 1874 he delivered his Cunningham Lectures, afterwards
  published as <i>The Humiliation of Christ</i>, and in the following year
  was appointed to the chair of Apologetics and New Testament exegesis at
  the Free Church College, Glasgow. This post he held for twenty-four
  years. He was one of the first British New Testament students whose work
  was received with consideration by German scholars of repute. The
  character and work of Christ were, he held, the ultimate proof and the
  best defence of Christianity; and his tendency was to concentrate
  attention somewhat narrowly on the historic Jesus. In <i>The Kingdom of
  God</i> (1889), which first encountered serious hostile criticism in his
  own communion, he accounted for some of the differences between the first
  and third evangelists on the principle of accommodation&mdash;maintaining
  that Luke had altered both the text and the spirit of his sources to suit
  the needs of those for whom he wrote. It was held that these admissions
  were not consistent with the views of inspiration professed by the Free
  Church. When the case was tried, the assembly held that the charge of
  heresy was based on a misunderstanding, but that "by want of due care in
  his mode of statement he had given some ground for the painful
  impressions which had existed."</p>

  <p>Bruce rendered signal service to his own communion in connexion with
  its service of praise. He was convener of the committee which issued the
  Free Church hymn book, and he threw into this work the same energy and
  catholicity of mind which marked the rest of his activities. He died on
  the 7th of August 1899, and was buried at Broughty Ferry. His chief
  works, beside the above, are: <i>The Chief End of Revelation</i> (Lond.,
  1881); <i>The Parabolic Teaching of Christ</i> (Lond., 1882); <i>F.C.
  Baur and his Theory of the Origin of Christianity and of the <!-- Page

  p.0676]</span>New Testament Writings</i> in "Present Day Tracts" (Lond.,
  1885); <i>Apologetics, or Christianity Defensively Stated</i> (Edin.,
  1892); <i>St Paul's Conception of Christianity</i> (Lond., 1894);
  <i>Expos. Gk. Test.</i> (the Synoptic Gospels, Lond., 1897). <i>With Open
  Face</i> (Lond., 1896); <i>The Epistle to the Hebrews</i> (Edin., 1899);
  <i>The Providential Order of the World</i>, and the <i>Moral Order of the
  World in Ancient and Modern Thought</i> (Gifford Lectures, 1896-1897;
  Lond., 1897, 1899).</p>

  <p><b>BRUCE, JAMES</b> (1730-1794), Scottish explorer in Africa, was born
  at Kinnaird House, Stirlingshire, on the 14th of December 1730. He was
  educated at Harrow and Edinburgh University, and began to study for the
  bar; but his marriage to the daughter of a wine merchant resulted in his
  entering that business. His wife died in October 1754, within nine months
  of marriage, and Bruce thereafter travelled in Portugal and Spain. The
  examination of oriental MSS. at the Escurial led him to the study of
  Arabic and Geez and determined his future career. In 1758 his father's
  death placed him in possession of the estate of Kinnaird. On the outbreak
  of war with Spain in 1762 he submitted to the British government a plan
  for an attack on Ferrol. His suggestion was not adopted, but it led to
  his selection by the 2nd earl of Halifax for the post of British consul
  at Algiers, with a commission to study the ancient ruins in that country,
  in which interest had been excited by the descriptions sent home by
  Thomas Shaw<a name="FnAnchor_201" href="#Footnote_201"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  (1694-1751), consular chaplain at Algiers, 1719-1731. Having spent six
  months in Italy studying antiquities, Bruce reached Algiers in March
  1763. The whole of his time was taken up with his consular duties at the
  piratical court of the dey, and he was kept without the assistance
  promised. But in August 1765, a successor in the consulate having
  arrived, Bruce began his exploration of the Roman ruins in Barbary.
  Having examined many ruins in eastern Algeria, he travelled by land from
  Tunis to Tripoli, and at Ptolemeta took passage for Candia; but was
  shipwrecked near Bengazi and had to swim ashore. He eventually reached
  Crete, and sailing thence to Sidon, travelled through Syria, visiting
  Palmyra and Baalbek. Throughout his journeyings in Barbary and the
  Levant, Bruce made careful drawings of the many ruins he examined. He
  also acquired a sufficient knowledge of medicine to enable him to pass in
  the East as a physician.</p>

  <p>In June 1768 he arrived at Alexandria, having resolved to endeavour to
  discover the source of the Nile, which he believed to rise in Abyssinia.
  At Cairo he gained the support of the Mameluke ruler, Ali Bey; after
  visiting Thebes he crossed the desert to Kosseir, where he embarked in
  the dress of a Turkish sailor. He reached Jidda in May 1769, and after
  some stay in Arabia he recrossed the Red Sea and landed at Massawa, then
  in possession of the Turks, on the 19th of September. He reached Gondar,
  then the capital of Abyssinia, on the 14th of February 1770, where he was
  well received by the negus Tekla Haimanot II., by Ras Michael, the real
  ruler of the country, by the ras's wife, Ozoro Esther, and by the
  Abyssinians generally. His fine presence (he was 6 ft. 4 in. high), his
  knowledge of Geez, his excellence in sports, his courage, resource and
  self-esteem, all told in his favour among a people who were in general
  distrustful of all foreigners. He stayed in Abyssinia for two years,
  gaining knowledge which enabled him subsequently to present a perfect
  picture of Abyssinian life. On the 14th of November 1770 he reached the
  long-sought source of the Blue Nile. Though admitting that the White Nile
  was the larger stream, Bruce claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of
  the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source. The
  claim, however, was not well founded (see <span class="sc">Nile</span>:
  <i>Story of Exploration</i>). Setting out from Gondar in December 1771,
  Bruce made his way, in spite of enormous difficulties, by Sennar to
  Nubia, being the first to trace the Blue Nile to its confluence with the
  White Nile. On the 29th of November 1772 he reached Assuan, presently
  returning to the desert to recover his journals and his baggage, which
  had been abandoned in consequence of the death of all his camels. Cairo
  was reached in January 1773, and in March Bruce arrived in France, where
  he was welcomed by Buffon and other <i>savants</i>. He came to London in
  1774, but, offended by the incredulity with which his story was received,
  retired to his home at Kinnaird. It was not until 1790 that, urged by his
  friend Daines Barrington, he published his <i>Travels to Discover the
  Source of the Nile in the Years 1768-73</i>, in five octavo volumes,
  lavishly illustrated. The work was very popular, but was assailed by
  other travellers as being unworthy of credence. The manner in which the
  book was written&mdash;twelve years after Bruce's return from Africa and
  without reference to his journals&mdash;gave some handle to his critics,
  but the substantial accuracy of every statement concerning his Abyssinian
  travels has since been amply demonstrated. He died on the 27th of April
  1794.</p>

  <p>Bruce wrote an autobiography, part of which is printed in editions of
  his <i>Travels</i>, published in 1805 and 1813, accompanied by a
  biographical notice by the editor, Alexander Murray. The best edition of
  the <i>Travels</i> is the third (Edinburgh, 1813, 8 vols.). Of the
  abridgments the best is that of Major (afterwards Sir Francis) Head, the
  author of a well-informed <i>Life of Bruce</i> (London, 1830). The best
  account of Bruce's travels in Barbary is contained in Sir R. Lambert
  Playfair's <i>Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce</i> (London, 1877), in
  which a selection of his drawings was published for the first time.
  Several of Bruce's drawings were presented to George III. and are in the
  royal collection at Windsor.</p>

  <p><b>BRUCE, MICHAEL</b> (1746-1767), Scottish poet, was born at
  Kinnesswood in the parish of Portmoak, Kinross-shire, on the 27th of
  March 1746. His father, Alexander Bruce, was a weaver, and a man of
  exceptional ability. Michael was taught to read before he was four years
  old, and one of his favourite books was a copy of Sir David Lyndsay's
  works. He was early sent to school, but his attendance was often
  interrupted. He had frequently to herd cattle on the Lomond Hills in
  summer, and this early companionship with nature greatly influenced his
  poetic genius. He was a delicate child, and grew up contemplative,
  devotional and humorous, the pet of his family and his friends. His
  parents gave him an education superior to their position; he studied
  Latin and Greek, and at fifteen, when his school education was completed,
  a small legacy left to his mother, with some additions from kindly
  neighbours, provided means to send Michael to Edinburgh University, which
  he attended during the four winter sessions 1762-1765. In 1765 he taught
  during the summer months at Gairney Bridge, receiving about £11 a year in
  fees and free board in one or other of the homes of his pupils. He became
  a divinity student at Kinross of a Scottish sect known as the Burghers,
  and in the first summer (1766) of his divinity course accepted the charge
  of a new school at Forest Hill, near Clackmannan, where he led a
  melancholy life. Poverty, disease and want of companions depressed his
  spirits, but there he wrote "Lochleven," a poem inspired by the memories
  of his childhood. He had before been threatened with consumption, and now
  became seriously ill. During the winter he returned on foot to his
  father's house, where he wrote his last and finest poem, "Elegy written
  in Spring," and died on the 5th of July 1767.</p>

  <p>As a poet his reputation has been spread, first, through sympathy for
  his early death; and secondly, through the alleged theft by John Logan
  (<i>q.v.</i>) of several of his poems. Logan, who had been a
  fellow-student of Bruce, obtained Bruce's MSS. from his father, shortly
  after the poet's death. For the letters, poems, &amp;c., that he allowed
  to pass out of his hands, Alexander Bruce took no receipt, nor did he
  keep any list of the titles. Logan edited in 1770 <i>Poems on Several
  Occasions, by Michael Bruce</i>, in which the "Ode to the Cuckoo"
  appeared. In the preface he stated that "to make up a miscellany, some
  poems written by different authors are inserted." In a collection of his
  own poems in 1781, Logan printed the "Ode to the Cuckoo" as his own; of
  this the friends of Bruce were aware, but did not challenge its
  appropriation publicly. In a MS. <i>Pious Memorials of Portmoak</i>,
  drawn up by Bruce's friend, David Pearson, Bruce's authorship of the "Ode
  to the Cuckoo" is emphatically asserted. This book was in the possession
  of the Birrell family, and John Birrell, another friend of the poet, adds
  a testimony to the same effect. Pearson and Birrell also wrote to Dr

  pointing out Bruce's claims. Their <!-- Page 677 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page677"></a>[v.04 p.0677]</span>communications
  were used by Anderson in the "Life" prefixed to Logan's works in the
  <i>British Poets</i> (vol. ii. p. 1029). The volume of 1770 had struck
  Bruce's friends as being incomplete, and his father missed his son's
  "Gospel Sonnets," which are supposed by the partisans of Bruce against
  Logan to have been the hymns printed in the 1781 edition of Logan's
  poems. Logan tried to prevent by law the reprinting of Bruce's poems (see
  James Mackenzie's <i>Life of Michael Bruce</i>, 1905, chap. xii.), but
  the book was printed in 1782, 1784, 1796 and 1807. Dr William
  M<sup>c</sup>Kelvie revived Bruce's claims in <i>Lochleven and Other
  Poems, by Michael Bruce, with a Life of the Author from Original
  Sources</i> (1837). Logan's authorship rests on the publication of the
  poems under his own name, and his reputation as author during his
  lifetime. His failure to produce the "poem book" of Bruce entrusted to
  him, and the fact that no copy of the "Ode to the Cuckoo" in his
  handwriting was known to exist during Bruce's lifetime, make it difficult
  to relieve him of the charge of plagiarism. Prof. John Veitch, in <i>The
  Feeling for Nature in Scottish Poetry</i> (1887, vol. ii. pp. 89-91),
  points out that the stanza known to be Logan's addition to this ode is
  out of keeping with the rest of the poem, and is in the manner of Logan's
  established compositions, in which there is nothing to suggest the direct
  simplicity of the little poem on the cuckoo.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;Additions to <i>Poems on
  Several Occasions</i> (1770) were made by Dr M<sup>c</sup>Kelvie in his
  1837 edition. He gives (p. 97) a list of the poems not printed in Logan's
  selection, and of those that are lost. See the "Lives" of Bruce and of
  Logan in Anderson's <i>British Poets</i> (1795); an admirable paper on
  Bruce in <i>The Mirror</i> (No. 36, 1779), said to be by William Craig,
  one of the lords of session; <i>The Poetical Works of Michael Bruce, with
  Life and Writings</i> (1895), by William Stephen, who, like Dr A.B.
  Grosart in his edition (1865) of <i>The Works of Michael Bruce</i>,
  adopts M<sup>c</sup>Kelvie's view. A restatement of the case for Bruce's
  authorship, coupled with a rather violent attack on Logan, is to be found
  in the <i>Life of Michael Bruce, Poet of Loch Leven, with Vindication of
  his Authorship of the "Ode to the Cuckoo" and other Poems, also Copies of
  Letters written by John Logan now first published</i> (1905), by James

  <p><b>BRUCH, MAX</b> (1838- ), German musical composer, son of a city
  official and grandson of the famous Evangelical cleric, Dr Christian
  Bruch, was born at Cologne on the 6th of January 1838. From his mother
  (<i>née</i> Almenräder), a well-known musician of her time, he learnt the
  elements of music, but under Breidenstein he made his first serious
  effort at composition at the age of fourteen, by the production of a
  symphony. In 1853 Bruch gained the Mozart Stipendium of 400 gulden per
  annum for four years at Frankfort-on-Main, and for the following few
  years studied under Hiller, Reinecke and Breunung. Subsequently he lived
  from 1858 to 1861 as pianoforte teacher at Cologne, in which city his
  first opera (in one act), <i>Scherz, List und Roche</i>, was produced in
  1858. On his father's death in 1861, Bruch began a tour of study at
  Berlin, Leipzig, Vienna, Munich, Dresden and Mannheim, where his opera
  <i>Lorelei</i> was brought out in 1863. At Mannheim he lived till 1864,
  and there he wrote some of his best-known works, including the beautiful
  <i>Frithjof</i>. After a further period of travel he became
  musical-director at Coblenz (1865-1867), Hofkapellmeister at
  Sondershausen (1867-1870), and lived in Berlin (1871-1873), where he
  wrote his <i>Odysseus</i>, his first violin concerto and two symphonies
  being composed at Sondershausen. After five years at Bonn (1873-1878),
  during which he made two visits to England, Bruch, in 1878, became
  conductor of the Stern Choral Union; and in 1880 of the Liverpool
  Philharmonic. In 1892 he was appointed director of the Berlin Hochschule.
  In 1893 he was given the honorary degree of Mus. Doc. by Cambridge
  University. Max Bruch has written in almost every conceivable musical
  form, invariably with straight-forward honest simplicity of design. He
  has a gift of refined melody beyond the common, his melodies being broad
  and suave and often exceptionally beautiful.</p>

  <p><b>BRUCHSAL,</b> a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Baden,
  prettily situated on the Saalbach, 14 m. N. from Karlsruhe, and an
  important junction on the main railway from Mannheim to Constance. Pop.
  (1900), including a small garrison, 13,555. There are an Evangelical and
  four Roman Catholic churches, among the latter that of St Peter, the
  burial-place of the bishops of Spires, whose princely residence (now used
  as a prison) lies in the vicinity. Bruchsal has a fine palace, with
  beautiful grounds attached, a town hall, a classical, a modern and a
  commercial school, and manufactures of machinery, paper, tobacco, soap
  and beer, and does a considerable trade in wine. Bruchsal (mentioned in
  937 as <i>Bruxolegum</i>) was originally a royal villa (<i>Königshof</i>)
  belonging to the emperors and German kings. Given in 1002 to Otto, duke
  of Franconia, it was inherited by the cadet line of Spires, the head of
  which, the emperor Henry III., gave it to the see of Spires in 1095. From
  1105 onward it became the summer residence of the bishops, who in 1190
  bought the <i>Vogtei</i> (advocateship) from the counts of Calw, and the
  place rapidly developed into a town. It remained in the possession of the
  bishops till 1802, when by the treaty of Lunéville it was ceded, with
  other lands of the bishopric on the right bank of the Rhine, to Baden.
  The Peasants' War during the Reformation period first broke out in
  Bruchsal. In 1609 it was captured by the elector palatine, and in 1676
  and 1698 it was burnt down by the French. In 1849 it was the scene of an
  engagement between the Prussians and the Baden revolutionists.</p>

  <p><b>BRUCINE,</b>
  C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, an alkaloid
  isolated in 1819 by J. Pelletier and J.B. Caventou from "false Angustura
  bark." It crystallizes in prisms with four molecules of water; when
  anhydrous it melts at 178°. It is very similar to strychnine
  (<i>q.v.</i>), both chemically and physiologically.</p>

  <p><b>BRUCITE,</b> a mineral consisting of magnesium hydroxide,
  Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and crystallizing in the rhombohedral system. It was
  first described in 1814 as "native magnesia" from New Jersey by A. Bruce,
  an American mineralogist, after whom the species was named by F.S.
  Beudant in 1824; the same name had, however, been earlier applied to the
  mineral now known as chondrodite. Brucite is usually found as platy
  masses, sometimes of considerable size, which have a perfect cleavage
  parallel to the surface of the plates. It is white, sometimes with a
  tinge of grey, blue or green, varies from transparent to translucent, and
  on the cleavage surfaces has a pronounced pearly lustre. In general
  appearance and softness (H = 2½) it is thus not unlike gypsum or talc,
  but it may be readily distinguished from these by its optical character,
  being uniaxial with positive birefringence, whilst gypsum is biaxial and
  talc has negative birefringence. The specific gravity is 2.38-2.40. In
  the variety known as nemalite the structure is finely fibrous and the
  lustre silky: this variety contains 5 to 8% of ferrous oxide replacing
  magnesia, and has consequently a rather higher specific gravity, viz.
  2.45. Another variety, manganbrucite, has the magnesia partly replaced by
  manganous oxide (14%), and thus forms a passage to the isomorphous
  mineral pyrochroite, Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

  <p>Brucite is generally associated with other magnesian minerals, such as
  magnesite and dolomite, and is commonly found in serpentine, or sometimes
  as small scales in phyllites and crystalline schists; it has also been
  observed in metamorphosed magnesian limestone, such as the rock known as
  predazzite from Predazzo in Tirol. The best crystals and foliated masses
  are from Texas in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., and from Swinaness in Unst, one
  of the Shetland Isles. Nemalite is from Hoboken, New Jersey, and from
  Afghanistan. At all these localities the mineral forms veins in
  serpentine.</p>

  the kingdom of Bavaria, on the Sinn, 16 m. N.W. of Kissingen. The mineral
  springs, five in number, situated in the pleasant valley of the Sinn, 2
  m. from the town, were a favourite resort of Louis I. of Bavaria. Pop.

  <p><b>BRUCKER, JOHANN JAKOB</b> (1696-1770), German historian of
  philosophy, was born at Augsburg. He was destined for the church, and
  graduated at the university of Jena in 1718. He returned to Augsburg in
  1720, but became parish minister of Kaufbeuren in 1723. In 1731 he was
  elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was invited to
  Augsburg as pastor and senior minister of the church of St Ulrich. His
  chief work, <i>Historia Critica Philosophiae</i>, appeared at Leipzig (5
  vols., 1742-1744). Its success was such that a new edition <!-- Page 678
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page678"></a>[v.04 p.0678]</span>was
  published in six volumes (1766-1767; English translation by W. Enfield,
  1791). It is by this work alone that Brucker is now known. Its merit
  consists entirely in the ample collection of materials. He also wrote
  <i>Tentamen Introductionis in Historiam Doctrinae de Ideis</i>,
  afterwards completed and republished under the title of <i>Historia
  Philosophicae Doctrinae de Ideis</i> (Augsburg, 1723); <i>Otium
  Vindelicum</i> (1731); <i>Kurze Fragen aus der philosophischen
  Historie</i> (7 vols., Ulm, 1731-1736), a history of philosophy in
  question and answer, containing many details, especially in the
  department of literary history, which he omitted in his chief work;
  <i>Pinacotheca Scriptorum nostra aetate literis illustrium, &amp;c.</i>
  (Augsburg, 1741-1755); <i>Ehrentempel der deutschen Gelehrsamkeit</i>
  (Augsburg, 1747-1749); <i>Institutiones Historiae Philosophicae</i>
  (Leipzig, 1747 and 1756; 3rd ed. with a continuation by F.G.B. Born
  (1743-1807) of Leipzig, in 1790); <i>Miscellanea Historiae Philosophicae
  Literariae Criticae olim sparsim edita</i> (Augsburg, 1748); <i>Erste
  Anfangsgrunde der philosophischen Geschichte</i> (Ulm, 1751). He
  superintended an edition of Luther's translation of the Old and New
  Testament, with a commentary extracted from the writings of the English
  theologians (Leipzig, 1758-1770, completed by W.A. Teller). He died at
  Augsburg in 1770.</p>

  <p><b>BRÜCKMANN, FRANZ ERNST</b> (1697-1753), German mineralogist, was
  born on the 27th of September 1697 at Marienthal near Helmstädt. Having
  qualified as a medical man in 1721, he practised at Brunswick and
  afterwards at Wolfenbüttel. His leisure time was given up to natural
  history, and especially to mineralogy and botany. He appears to have been
  the first to introduce the term <i>oolithus</i> to rocks that resemble in
  structure the roe of a fish; whence the terms oolite and oolitic. He died
  at Wolfenbüttel on the 21st of March 1753. He published <i>Magnalia Dei
  in locis subterraneis</i> (Brunswick, 1727), <i>Historia naturalis
  curiosa lapidis</i> (1727), and <i>Thesaurus subterraneus Ducatus
  Brunsvigii</i> (1728).</p>

  <p><b>BRUCKNER, ANTON</b> (1824-1896), Austrian musical composer, was
  born on the 4th of September 1824 at Ansfelden in upper Austria. He
  successfully competed for the organistship for Linz Cathedral in 1855. In
  1867 he succeeded his former master of counterpoint, Sechter, as organist
  of the <i>Hofkapelle</i> in Vienna, and also became professor in the
  conservatorium. In 1875 he was appointed to a lectureship in the
  university. His most striking talent was shown in his extemporizations on
  the organ. His success in an organ competition at Nancy in 1869 led to
  his playing in Paris and London (six recitals at the Albert Hall, 1871).
  His permanent reputation, however, rests on his compositions, especially
  his nine symphonies. In these gigantic efforts the influence of Wagner is
  paramount in almost every feature of harmony and orchestration; and if
  sustained seriousness of purpose and style were all that was necessary to
  give coherence to works in which these influences are stultified by the
  rhythmic uniformities of an experienced <i>improvisatore</i> and the
  impressions of classical form as taught in schools, then Bruckner would
  certainly have been what the extreme Wagnerian party called him, the
  symphonic successor of Beethoven, or the Wagner of the symphony. But
  their lack of organization and proportion, to say nothing of humour, will
  always make their revival a somewhat severe task. No composer has ever
  been more consistent to lofty ideals, though few who have ever had an
  ideal have shown less adroitness in their methods of embodying it. The
  most poetic and admired feature of his style is a slow growth to a
  gigantic climax, slow enough and gigantic enough for any situation in
  Wagner's <i>Nibelungen</i> tetralogy. The symphonies in which these
  climaxes occur are in obviously unskilful classical form, with only an
  outward appearance of freedom; and the Great Pyramid would hardly be more
  out of place in an Oxford quadrangle than Bruckner's climaxes in his
  four-movement symphonies with their "second subjects" and
  recapitulations. Nor is it likely that Bruckner would have been much more
  successful in handling these gigantic things in their legitimate
  Wagnerian dramatic environment, for even in his last three symphonies he
  hardly ever frees himself from the trammels of square rhythm; and, as he
  accepts the classical sonata-forms without inquiry into their meaning or
  relevance, so he accepts the Wagnerian stage orchestra in its minutest
  details, without inquiry as to its relevance for the purposes and
  acoustics of the concert-room, and with the same lack of sense of relief
  that ruins the balance of his rhythmic periods. So unsophisticated a
  temperament may be not unpoetical, but it is eminently undramatic, as
  well as unsymphonic. Of Bruckner's choral works, which include three
  masses and several psalms and motets, the most famous is the <i>Te
  Deum</i> (1885?),<a name="FnAnchor_211"
  href="#Footnote_211"><sup>[1]</sup></a> which shows his characteristic
  power in massive effect. Bruckner wished this to be appended to the three
  complete movements of his 9th symphony, which his last illness (ending in
  his death at Vienna on the 11th of October 1896) prevented him from
  finishing. This 9th symphony is designed, with characteristic
  tactlessness and simplicity, to follow Beethoven's 9th symphony in every
  possible point which could challenge comparison; in key (D minor),
  opening (mysterious tremolo leading to tremendous unison <i>tutti</i>),
  contrasts (return in first movement) and choral finale. The three
  complete movements were first performed in Vienna in 1903, and have done
  more for Bruckner's fame than anything since the production in 1884 of
  his 7th symphony (of which the slow movement is an elegy on the death of
  Wagner). It is probable that the impression produced by this 9th symphony
  is the deeper as owing little or nothing to the musical politics which
  had gone far to prevent the 7th symphony from standing on its own
  unmistakable merits. It does not, however, seem likely that Bruckner's
  work will have much influence on musical progress; for the modern
  characteristics in which its strength lies are obviously better realized
  in other forms which have often been handled successfully by composers
  greatly Bruckner's inferiors both in invention and sincerity.</p>

  <p><b>BRUGES</b> (Flemish <i>Brugge</i>, a name signifying the bridge or
  place of bridges), the capital of West Flanders, Belgium. Pop. (1904)
  53,728. The city contains some of the finest monuments of the great
  period of the Flemish communes, while its medieval appearance is better
  preserved, as a whole, than in the case of any other Belgian city. The
  cathedral of St Sauveur and the church of Notre-Dame, both specimens of
  early Pointed Gothic, date from the 13th and 14th centuries. Both are
  full of interest, but the cathedral was much injured by fire in 1839. The
  interior, however, is finely proportioned and exhibits beautiful modern
  polychrome decorations, numerous pictures and interesting monumental
  brasses. The church of Notre-Dame contains a fine De Crayer (The
  Adoration of the Magi), Michelangelo's marble group of the Virgin and
  Child, and the fine monuments with gilded copper effigies of Charles the
  Bold and his daughter, Mary of Burgundy. The hospital of St Jean, where
  the sick have been cared for since the 12th century, contains the chief
  works of Memling, including the famous reliquary of St Ursula. The
  market-hall was built in 1561-1566 on the site of an older building, some
  portions of which were utilized in its successor. The belfry which rises
  in the centre of the façade dates from the end of the 13th century; it
  has long been famous for its chime of bells, but the civic fathers have
  caused modern airs to be substituted for the old hymn. The hôtel de
  ville, the Chapelle du Saint-Sang and the church of St Jacques are all of
  interest. The first is Gothic and was begun about 1376. The second is a
  chapel of two storeys, the lower dating from 1150, while the upper was
  rebuilt in the 15th century, and there is a rich Flamboyant entrance with
  a stairway (1533). St Jacques' church is a foundation of the 13th
  century, but has extensive additions of the close of the 15th and 17th
  centuries. The Palais de Justice, of the 18th century, on the site of the
  House of the Franc&mdash;the outside burghers of the Franc district
  admitted to the full privileges of citizenship&mdash;contains a fine
  carved chimney-piece (1530). The house is supposed to have formed part of
  the residence of the counts of Flanders. There are numerous other
  buildings of minor antiquarian interest; the fine museum contains a
  representative gallery of early Flemish paintings; and of the old
  fortifications three gates remain. The <!-- Page 679 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page679"></a>[v.04 p.0679]</span>manufacture of
  lace now gives employment to at least 6000 persons in the town, and
  horticulture is carried on extensively in the suburbs. Commercial
  activity has been assisted by the new ship-canal to Zeebrugge, and by
  direct steamship service from Hull to Bruges. The steady growth of the
  population is evidence of increased prosperity. In 1880 the population
  was only 44,500, but it had risen in 1900 to 51,657 and in 1904 it was
  53,728.</p>

  <p>Bruges is said to have been a city in the 7th century, and the name
  Flanders was originally applied to it and not to the district. Baldwin
  II., count of Flanders, who married Elstrud, daughter of Alfred the
  Great, first fortified it, and made it his chief residence. Before the
  year 1180 Bruges was the recognized capital of Flanders, and the
  formality of proclaiming the new counts was always performed on the
  <i>marché du vendredi</i>, where the railway station is to-day. After
  1180 the premier position was assumed by Ghent, but until access by sea
  was stopped by the silting up of the Zwyn, which was complete by the year
  1490, Bruges was the equal in wealth and power of its neighbour. Proof of
  this is supplied by the marriage festivities in 1430, when Philip the
  Good, duke of Burgundy, wedded Isabel of Portugal, and founded the famous
  order of the Golden Fleece out of compliment to the staple industry of
  Bruges. Bruges was at the height of its prosperity in the 14th century,
  when it was the northern counterpart of Venice and its Bourse regulated
  the rate of exchange in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>BRUGSCH, HEINRICH KARL</b> (1827-1894), German Egyptologist, was
  the son of a Prussian cavalry officer, and was born in the barracks at
  Berlin, on the 18th of February 1827. He early manifested a great
  inclination to Egyptian studies, in which, though encouraged by Humboldt,
  he was almost entirely self-taught. After completing his university
  course and visiting foreign museums he was sent to Egypt by the Prussian
  government in 1853, and contracted an intimate friendship with Mariette.
  On his return he received an appointment in the Berlin museum. In 1860 he
  was sent to Persia on a special mission under Baron Minutoli, travelled
  over the country, and after Minutoli's death discharged the functions of
  ambassador. In 1864 he was consul at Cairo, in 1868 professor at
  Gõttingen, and in 1870 director of the school of Egyptology, founded at
  Cairo by the khedive. From this post he was unceremoniously dismissed in
  1879 by the European controllers of the public revenues, determined to
  economize at all hazards; and French influence prevented his succeeding
  his friend Mariette at the Bulaq Museum in 1883. He afterwards resided
  principally in Germany until his death on the 9th of September 1894, but
  frequently visited Egypt, took part in another official mission to
  Persia, and organized an Egyptian exhibit at the Philadelphia Exposition
  in 1876. He had been made a pasha by the khedive in 1881. He published
  his autobiography in 1894, concluding with a warm panegyric upon British
  rule in Egypt. Brugsch's services to Egyptology are most important,
  particularly in the decipherment of demotic and the making of a vast
  hieroglyphic-demotic dictionary (1867-1882).</p>

  <p><b>BRÜHL, HEINRICH,</b> <span class="sc">Count von</span> (1700-1763),
  German statesman at the court of Saxony, was born on the 13th of August
  1700. He was the son of Johann Moritz von Brühl, a noble who held the
  office of <i>Oberhofmarschall</i> at the small court of
  Sachsen-Weissenfels. The father was ruined and compelled to part with his
  family estate, which passed into the hands of the prince. The son was
  first placed as page with the dowager duchess of Weissenfels, and was
  then received at her recommendation into the court of the elector of
  Saxony as <i>Silberpage</i> on the 16th of April 1719. He rapidly
  acquired the favour of the elector Frederick Augustus, surnamed the
  Strong, who had been elected to the throne of Poland in 1697. Brühl, who
  began as page and chamberlain, was largely employed in procuring money
  for his profuse master. He made himself useful in muzzling the Saxon
  states and was successively chief receiver of taxes and minister for the
  interior in 1731. He was at Warsaw when his master died in 1733, and he
  secured a hold on the confidence of the electoral prince, Frederick
  Augustus, who was at Dresden, by laying hands on the papers and jewels of
  the late ruler and bringing them promptly to his successor. During the
  whole of the thirty years of the reign of Frederick Augustus II. he was
  the real inspirer of his master and the practical chief of the Saxon
  court. He had for a time to put up with the presence of old servants of
  the electoral house, but after 1738 he was in effect sole minister. The
  title of prime minister was created for him in 1746, but he was not only
  a prime minister&mdash;he filled all the offices. His titles spread over
  several lines of print, and he drew the combined pay of the places
  besides securing huge grants of land. Brühl must therefore be held wholly
  responsible for the ruinous policy which destroyed the position of Saxony
  in Germany between 1733 and 1763; for the mistaken ambition which led
  Frederick Augustus II. to become a candidate for the throne of Poland;
  for the engagements into which he entered in order to secure the support
  of the emperor Charles VI.; for the shameless and ill-timed
  tergiversations of Saxony during the wars of the Austrian Succession; for
  the intrigues which entangled the electorate in the alliance against
  Frederick the Great, which led to the Seven Years' War; and for the waste
  and want of foresight which left the country utterly unprepared to resist
  the attack of the king of Prussia. He was not only without political or
  military capacity, but was so garrulous that he could not keep a secret.
  His indiscretion was repeatedly responsible for the king of Prussia's
  discoveries of the plans laid against him. Nothing could shake the
  confidence of his master, which survived the ignominious flight into
  Bohemia, into which he was trapped by Brühl at the time of the battle of
  Kesseldorf, and all the miseries of the Seven Years' War. The favourite
  abused the confidence of his master shamelessly. Not content with the
  67,000 talers a month which he drew as salary for his innumerable
  offices, he was found when an inquiry was held in the next reign to have
  abstracted more than five million talers of public money for his private
  use. He left the work of the government offices to be done by his
  lackeys, whom he did not even supervise. His profusion was boundless.
  Twelve tailors, it is said, were continually employed in making clothes
  for him, and he wore a new suit every day. His library of 70,000 volumes
  was one of his forms of ostentation, and so was his gallery of pictures.
  He died on the 28th of October 1763, having survived his master only for
  a few weeks. The new elector, Frederick Christian, dismissed him from
  office and caused an inquiry to be held into his administration. His
  fortune was found to amount to a million and a half of talers, and was
  sequestered but afterwards restored to his family. In 1736 he had been
  made a count of the Empire and had married the countess Franziska von
  Kolowrat-Kradowska, a favourite of the wife of Frederick Augustus. Four
  sons and a daughter survived him.</p>

  <p>His youngest son, Hans Moritz von Brühl (d. 1811), was before the
  Revolution of 1789 a colonel in the French service, and afterwards
  general inspector of roads in Brandenburg and Pomerania. By his wife
  Margarethe Schleierweber, the daughter of a French corporal, but renowned
  for her beauty and intellectual gifts, he was the father of Karl
  Friedrich Moritz Paul von Brühl (1772-1837), the friend of Goethe, who as
  intendant-general of the Prussian royal theatres was of some importance
  in the history of the development of the drama in Germany. In 1830 he was
  appointed intendant-general of the royal museums.</p>

  <p><b>BRÜHL,</b> a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, 8 m.
  S.W. from Cologne on the main railway to Coblenz. Pop. (1900) 5000. Its
  pleasant situation at the foot of one of the spurs of the Eifel range and
  the beautiful grounds surrounding the royal palace render it a favourite
  resort of the inhabitants of Cologne. The palace, in Renaissance style,
  built in 1728 by Clement Augustus, elector of Cologne (1700-1761), was
  from 1809 until 1813 in the possession of the French marshal Davout, and
  in 1842 was restored by King Frederick William IV. of Prussia.</p>

  <p><b>BRUMAIRE,</b> the name of the second month in the republican
  calendar which was established in France by a decree of the National
  Convention on the 5th of October in the year II. (1793), completed with
  regard to nomenclature by Fabre d'Églantine, and promulgated in its new
  form on the 4th of Frimaire in the year II. (the 24th of November 1793).
  The month of Brumaire began on the day which corresponded, according to
  the year, to the 22nd or to the 23rd of October of the old calendar, and
  ended on the 20th or 21st of November, It was divided into "decades" like
  the other months of the republican calendar. Its name alludes to the fogs
  and mists frequent at that time of the year. The most important event in
  French history which took place during that month was the <i>coup
  d'état</i> of the 18th Brumaire in the year VIII. (the 9th of November
  1799), by which General Bonaparte overthrew the government of the
  Directory to replace it by the Consulate.</p>

  <p><b>BRUMATH,</b> or <span class="sc">Brumpt</span>, a town of Germany,
  in the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine, on the Zorn and the
  Strassburg-Avricourt railway. Pop. 5500. It has a Roman Catholic and a
  Protestant church, and occupies the site of the Roman Brocomagus. Its
  industries comprise tanning and saw-milling, and it has some trade in
  wine and tobacco and hops.</p>

  <p><b>BRUMMAGEM</b> (an old local form of "Birmingham"), a name first
  applied to a counterfeit coin made in the city of Birmingham, England, in
  the I7th century, and later to the plated and imitation articles made
  there; hence cheap, showy or tawdry. The name was particularly used of
  the supporters of the Exclusion Bill in 1680, with the meaning of "sham
  Protestant." Similarly the Tory opponents of the Bill were nicknamed
  "Anti-Birminghams" or "Brummagems."</p>

  <p><b>BRUMMELL, GEORGE BRYAN</b> (1778-1840), English man of fashion,
  known as "<span class="sc">Beau Brummell</span>," was born in London on
  the 7th of June 1778. His father was private secretary to Lord North from
  1770 to 1782, and subsequently high sheriff of Berkshire; his grandfather
  was a shopkeeper in the parish of St James, who supplemented his income
  by letting lodgings to the aristocracy. From his early years George
  Brummell paid great attention to his dress. At Eton, where he was sent to
  school in 1790, and was extremely popular, he was known as Buck Brummell,
  and at Oxford, where he spent a brief period as an undergraduate of Oriel
  College, he preserved this reputation, and added to it that of a wit and
  good story-teller, while the fact that he was second for the Newdigate
  prize is evidence of his literary capacity. Before he was sixteen,
  however, he left Oxford, for London, where the prince of Wales
  (afterwards George IV.), to whom he had been presented at Eton, and who
  had been told that Brummell was a highly amusing fellow, gave him a
  commission in his own regiment (1794). Brummell soon became intimate with
  his patron&mdash;indeed he was so constantly in the prince's company that
  he is reported not to have known his own regimental troop. In 1798,
  having then reached the rank of captain, he left the service, and next
  year succeeded to a fortune of about £30,000. Setting up a bachelor
  establishment in Mayfair, he became, thanks to the prince of Wales's
  friendship and his own good taste in dress, the recognized <i>arbiter
  elegantiarum</i>. His social success was instant and complete, his
  repartees were the talk of the town, and, if not accurately speaking a
  wit, he had a remarkable talent for presenting the most ordinary
  circumstances in an amusing light. Though he always dressed well, he was
  no mere fop&mdash;Lord Byron is credited with the remark that there was
  nothing remarkable about his dress save "a certain exquisite propriety."
  For a time Brummell's sway was undisputed. But eventually gambling and
  extravagance exhausted his fortune, while his tongue proved too sharp for
  his royal patron. They quarrelled, and though for a time Brummell
  continued to hold his place in society, his popularity began to decline.
  In 1816 he fled to Calais to avoid his creditors. Here he struggled on
  for fourteen years, receiving help from time to time from his friends in
  England, but always hopelessly in debt. In 1830 the interest of these
  friends secured him the post of British consul at Caen, to which a
  moderate salary was attached, but two years later the office was
  abolished. In 1835 Brummell's French creditors in Calais and Caen lost
  patience and he was imprisoned, but his friends once more came to the
  rescue, paid his debts and provided him with a small income. He had now
  lost all his interest in dress; his personal appearance was slovenly and
  dirty. In 1837, after two attacks of paralysis, shelter was found for him
  in the charitable asylum of Bon Sauveur, Caen, where he died on the 30th
  of March 1840.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNCK, RICHARD FRANÇOIS PHILIPPE</b> (1729-1803), French classical
  scholar, was born at Strassburg on the 30th of December 1729. He was
  educated at the Jesuits' College at Paris, and took part in the Seven
  Years' War as military commissary. At the age of thirty he returned to
  his native town and resumed his studies, paying special attention to
  Greek. He spent considerable sums of money in publishing editions of the
  Greek classics. The first work which he edited was the <i>Anthologia
  Graeca</i> or <i>Analecta veterum Poetarum Graecorum</i> (1772-1776), in
  which his innovations on the established mode of criticism startled
  European scholars; for wherever it seemed to him that an obscure or
  difficult passage might be made intelligible and easy by a change of
  text, he did not scruple to make the necessary alterations, whether the
  new reading were supported by manuscript authority or not. Other works by
  him are:&mdash;Editions of Anacreon (1778), several plays of the Greek
  tragedians, Apollonius Rhodius (1780), Aristophanes, with an excellent
  Latin translation (1781-1783), <i>Gnomici poetae Graeci</i> (1784),
  Sophocles (1786), with Latin translation, his best work, for which he
  received a pension of 2000 francs from the king. He also published
  editions of Virgil (1785), Plautus (1788) and Terence (1797). At the
  outbreak of the French Revolution, in which he took an active part, he
  was imprisoned at Besançon, and lost his pension, being reduced to such
  extremities that he was obliged to sell a portion of his library. In 1802
  his pension was restored to him, but too late to prevent the sale of the
  remainder of his books. He died on the 12th of June 1803.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNDISIUM</b> (Gr. <span title="Brentesion" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&rho;&epsilon;&nu;&tau;&#x1F73;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
  mod. <i>Brindisi</i>), an important harbour town of Calabria (in the
  ancient sense), Italy, on the E.S.E. coast. The name is said to mean
  "stag's head" in the Messapian dialect, in allusion to the shape of the
  harbour. Tradition varies as to its founders; but we find it hostile to
  Tarentum, and in friendly relations with Thurii. With a fertile territory
  round it, it became the most important city of the Messapians, but it was
  developed by the Romans, into whose hands it only came after the conquest
  of the Sallentini in 266 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> They founded a
  colony there in 245 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and the Via Appia was
  perhaps extended through Tarentum as far as Brundisium at this period.
  Pacuvius was born here about 220 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> After the
  Punic Wars it became the chief point of embarkation for Greece and the
  East, via Dyrrachium or Corcyra. In the Social War it received Roman
  citizenship, and was made a free port by Sulla. It suffered, however,
  from a siege conducted by Caesar in 49 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  (<i>Bell. Civ.</i> i.) and was again attacked in 42 and 40 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> Virgil died here in 19 <span

  the Via Trajana, a more direct route from Beneventum to Brundisium. The
  remains of ancient buildings are unimportant, though a considerable
  number of antiquities, especially inscriptions, have been discovered
  here: one column 62 ft. in height, with an ornate capital, still stands,
  and near it is the base of another, the column itself having been removed
  to Lecce. They are said to have marked the termination of the Via
  Appia.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNE, GUILLAUME MARIE ANNE</b> (1763-1815), marshal of France, the
  son of an advocate, was born at Brives-la-Gaillarde (Corrèze), on the
  13th of March 1763. Before the Revolution he went to Paris to study law,
  and here he became a political journalist, a Jacobin and a friend of
  Danton. He was appointed <!-- Page 681 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page681"></a>[v.04 p.0681]</span>in 1793 to a superior command in
  the army direct from civil life, and as a general of brigade he took part
  in the fighting of the 13th Vendémiaire. In 1796 he fought under
  Bonaparte in Italy, and was promoted general of division for good service
  in the field. In 1798 he commanded the French army which occupied
  Switzerland, and in the following year he was in command of the French
  troops in Holland. His defence of Amsterdam against the Anglo-Russian
  expedition under the duke of York was completely successful; the invaders
  were defeated, and compelled, after a miserable retreat, to re-embark. He
  rendered further good service in Vendée and in Italy, and was made a
  marshal by Napoleon on the assumption by the latter of the imperial title
  in 1804. In 1807 Brune held a command in North Germany, but he was not
  afterwards employed during the First Empire. It is said that he was
  accused of venality, and on that account disgraced, but of this there is
  no proof. He was recalled to active service during the Hundred Days, and
  as commander of the army of the Var he defended the south of France
  against the Austrians. He was murdered by royalists during the White
  Terror at Avignon on the 2nd of August 1815.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNEAU, ALFRED</b> (1857- ), French musical composer, was born in
  Paris. His parents were devoted to music, and he was brought up to play
  the 'cello, being educated at the Paris Conservatoire. He played in
  Pasdeloup's orchestra, and soon began to compose, writing a cantata,
  <i>Geneviève de Paris</i>, at an early age. In 1884 his <i>Ouverture
  héroïque</i> was performed, followed by the choral symphonies,
  <i>Léda</i> (1884), <i>La Belle au bois dormant</i> (1886) and
  <i>Penthésilée</i>. But he is best known as a dramatic composer. In 1887
  his first opera, <i>Kérim</i>, was produced; and in 1891 his successful
  opera <i>Le Rêve</i>, with a libretto founded on Zola's story. Another
  subject from Zola resulted in the opera <i>L'Attaque du moulin</i>
  (1893), and libretti by Zola himself were written for his next operas
  <i>Messidor</i> (1897) and <i>L'Ouragan</i> (1901). Among Bruneau's other
  works may be mentioned his <i>Requiem</i> (1896), and his two collections
  of songs, <i>Lieds de France</i> and <i>Chansons à danser</i>. He was
  decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1895. His musical criticisms,
  published in several volumes, are remarkable for literary quality and
  vigour.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNEI,</b> a state situated in the north-west of Borneo. It has
  been so diminished in area since the beginning of the 19th century as to
  have become in comparison with the other states of Borneo territorially
  insignificant. It formerly included the whole of northern Borneo and
  southern Palawan, and stretched down the west coast as far as Sambas.
  What remains of this once powerful sultanate is a triangular-shaped
  territory, the base of the triangle being represented by 80 m. of
  coast-line, and the two sides by the frontiers of Sarawak. The area is
  calculated to be about 1700 sq. m. This great reduction of the extent of
  the territory has been brought about by the cession on successive
  occasions of strips of territory to Sarawak and to the British North
  Borneo Company on condition of annual payments of money. In 1888 the
  state was placed under British protection. On the 2nd of January 1906 a
  treaty was made whereby the sultan of Brunei agreed to hand over the
  general administration of his state to a British resident. The sultan
  Mahommed Jomal-ul-alam, born in 1889, succeeded his father in May 1906.
  He receives an allowance of 12,000 dollars a year from state funds, and
  his two principal ministers receive allowances of 6000 dollars a year
  each. The interior people have for centuries been subject to petty
  oppression, and there is too much of the old spirit left among the Malays
  to avoid acrimonious dispute and rebellion.</p>

  <p>The bulk of the inhabitants, who consist of Malays, Kadayans, Orang
  Bukits and a few Muruts, are to be found in and about the
  capital&mdash;also called Brunei&mdash;the population of the city being
  estimated at about 15,000, and the population of the whole territory
  being about 25,000. The city is prettily situated on the river, with a
  background of cleared hills, and in the distance heights clothed with
  magnificent forest. The dwelling-houses are built over the river on
  slender piles obtained from the Nibong palm which resists the action of
  the water for several years. Though there are practically no exports and
  imports, there is a certain amount of inland commerce, the Brunei Malay
  usually earning a living by trading with the interior tribes of Sarawak
  and British North Borneo. Some of them are skilled workers of brass, and
  the Brunei women make very beautiful cloth, interwoven and embroidered
  with gold thread. Sago is worked in the important river-valleys of the
  Tutong and the Balait, but only a small quantity of rice is
  cultivated.</p>

  <p>The history of this ancient and decaying sultanate is of some
  interest. Brunei, or, as it is called by the natives Bruni or
  Dar-ul-Salam (city of peace), possesses a historic tablet of stone upon
  which, in <span class="scac">A.H.</span> 1221 (1804), was engraved in
  Malay characters the genealogy of the sovereigns who have ruled over the
  country. The engraving was the work of Datu Imaum Yakub, the high priest
  at the time, who received the genealogy from the lips of Merhoum Bongsu,
  otherwise Sultan Muadin, and Sultan Kemal-Udin, who ordered this record
  of their forefathers to be written. This stone tablet now stands on the
  tomb of Sultan Mahommed Jemal-ul-Alam at the foot of Panggal hill, in the
  city of Brunei. The Selesilah, or book of descent, is kept in the palace
  by the sultan. The other heirlooms, which are also kept in the sultan's
  palace, and which descend to each sultan in turn, are the "Nobab Nagara"
  (two royal drums) from Johore and Menang-Kabau, and the "Gunta Alamat"
  (bells), the gift of Sultan Bahkei of Johore or Malacca. The first sultan
  of Brunei was Alak-ber-Tata, who was probably of Bisaya stock, and
  governed the country before the introduction of Islam, in the 15th
  century. He assumed the name of Mahommed on his conversion to Islam,
  which was brought about during a visit to the Malay peninsula. Brunei, at
  this time, was a dependency of Majapahit (Java), and paid a yearly
  tribute of a jar of areca juice obtained from the young green nuts of the
  areca palm, and of no monetary value. The Hindu kingdom of Menjapahit was
  destroyed by the Mahommedans in 1478, and Brunei is mentioned in the
  history of Java as one of the countries conquered by Adaya Mingrat, the
  general of Angka Wijaya. Sultan Mahommed's only child was a daughter. His
  brother Akhmed married the daughter of Ong Chum Ping, a Chinese officer
  said to have been sent by his emperor to obtain a jewel from Mount
  Kinabalu in North Borneo, and was the successor of Sultan Mahommed in the
  sovereignty of Brunei. He was succeeded by Sultan Berkat, an Arab sherif
  of high rank, from the country of Taif in Arabia, who had married Sultan
  Akhmed's only child. Sultan Berkat built a mosque and enforced Mahommedan
  law, and with the assistance of the Chinese built the stone wall, which
  is still in existence between the islands of Kaya Orang and Chermin, by
  sinking forty junks filled with rock across the mouth of the Brunei
  river. This work was completed before the arrival of Pigafetta in 1521.
  In the reign of Sultan Bulkeiah Magellan's squadron anchored off the
  mouth of Brunei river in August 1521, and Pigafetta makes mention of the
  splendid court and the imperial magnificence of the Borneo capital.
  Sultan Bulkeiah was otherwise known as Nakoda Ragam; he was the greatest
  warrior of Brunei and made military expeditions to Java, Malacca, Luzon
  and all the coasts of Borneo. His tomb, which is handsomely built of
  stone, is still to be seen in Brunei, and is constantly visited by
  Malays, who leave money and various articles on the tomb as offerings to
  his memory. Others, again, come and take away anything they can find,
  which they keep as charms and mementoes. The Spaniards captured Brunei in
  1580, the reigning sultan and his court retiring to Suai in the Baram
  district. The invaders were compelled to evacuate the place, however, in
  consequence of the heavy losses they sustained in the numerous attempts
  made for its recovery. The golden age of Brunei was nevertheless at an
  end, and there is little more of importance to record. Disputed
  successions and civil war, maladministration and the untrustworthiness of
  the Malay character, caused a steady decline in prosperity. The East
  India Company started a factory in the town in the 18th century, but
  commerce had already decayed and the establishment was abandoned. In the
  early part of the 19th centuiy Brunei was but <!-- Page 682 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page682"></a>[v.04 p.0682]</span>a resort for
  pirates and a market for the slave trade. During the 'forties Admiral
  (then Captain) Keppel and other officers of the British navy suppressed
  piracy in the neighbourhood. Sarawak was handed over to Raja Brooke, and,
  after the capture and temporary occupation of Brunei by Sir Thomas
  Cochrane, Labuan was ceded to the British empire. From this island it was
  possible to exercise a certain control over the townspeople, and a consul
  was stationed there to watch affairs. Nowadays the political consequence
  of Brunei largely arises from the existence there of valuable seams of
  coal, leased to the Sarawak government.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNEL, ISAMBARD KINGDOM</b> (1806-1859), English engineer, only
  son of Sir M.I. Brunel, was born at Portsmouth on the 9th of April 1806.
  He displayed in childhood singular powers of mental calculation, great
  skill and rapidity as a draughtsman, and a true feeling for art. At the
  age of fourteen he was sent to Paris, to study at the Collège Henri
  Quatre. In 1823 he entered his father's office as assistant-engineer,
  just at the time when the project of the Thames Tunnel was beginning to
  take shape; and during the later portion of the time, from 1825, when the
  work was begun, till 1828, when it was stopped by an irruption of the
  river, he was both nominal and actual resident engineer. In November 1829
  he sent in designs and plans for the projected suspension bridge over the
  Avon at Clifton, but in consequence of objections raised by Thomas
  Telford, the referee of the bridge committee, his plans were rejected.
  But a new design which he sent in on a second competition in 1831 was
  accepted, and he was appointed engineer. The works were begun in 1836,
  but owing to lack of funds were not completed until 1864, after Brunel's
  death; his design, however, was closely adhered to, and the chains
  employed came from the old Hungerford suspension bridge (London), which
  he had built in 1841-1845, but which was displaced in 1862 by the Charing
  Cross railway bridge.</p>

  <p>In March 1833 Brunel, at the age of twenty-seven, was appointed
  engineer of the newly-projected Great Western railway. For several years
  his energies were taxed to the utmost by the conflict with obstructive
  landowners and short-sighted critics; but he showed himself equal to the
  occasion, not only as a professional man, but as a persuasive negotiator.
  Among the engineering triumphs on that railway are the Hanwell viaduct,
  the Maidenhead bridge and the Box tunnel, at the time the longest in the
  world. The famous "battle of the gauges" took its rise from his
  introduction of the broad (7 ft.) gauge on that line. In 1846 he resigned
  his office as engineer of the Great Western railway. In 1844 he had
  recommended the adoption of the atmospheric system on the South Devon
  railway, but after a year's trial the system was abandoned. The last and
  greatest of Brunel's railway works was the Royal Albert bridge over the
  river Tamar at Saltash. This work, sanctioned by parliament in 1845, was
  constructed between 1853 and 1859.</p>

  <p>In addition to the arduous labours of railway engineering Brunel took
  a leading part in the systematic development of ocean steam navigation.
  As early as October 1835 he had suggested to the directors of the Great
  Western railway, that they should "make it longer, and have a steamboat
  to go from Bristol to New York, and call it the 'Great Western.'" The
  project was taken up, and the "Great Western" steamship was designed by
  Brunel, and built at Bristol under his superintendence. It was much
  longer than any steamer of the day, and was the first steamship built to
  make regular voyages across the Atlantic. While the vessel was building a
  controversy was raised about the practicability of Brunel's scheme, Dr D.
  Lardner asserting dogmatically that the voyage could not be made, and
  backing his assertion with an array of figures. His view was widely
  accepted, but the work went on, and the voyage was accomplished in 1838.
  Brunel at once undertook a still larger design in the "Great Britain,"
  which was the first large iron steamship, the largest ship afloat at that
  time, and the first large ship in which the screw-propeller was used. She
  made her first voyage from Liverpool to New York in August and September
  1845; but in the following year was carelessly run upon the rocks in
  Dundrum Bay on the coast of Ireland. After lying there nearly a year
  without material damage she was got off and was employed in the
  Australian trade. Brunel soon after began to meditate a still vaster
  project, the construction of a vessel large enough to carry all the coal
  required for a long voyage out, and if coal could not be had at the out
  port, then to carry enough also for the return voyage. It seemed to him,
  further, that a great increase of size would give many advantages for
  navigation. During his connexion as engineer with the Australian Mail
  Company he worked out into a practical shape his conception of a "great
  ship"; and in 1852 his scheme was laid before the directors of the
  Eastern Steam Navigation Company. It was adopted, the projector being
  appointed engineer, and after much time occupied about contracts and
  specifications the work was begun in December 1853. Immense difficulties
  in the progress of construction caused delays from time to time. The
  operation of launching was several times attempted in vain; but at length
  the gigantic vessel, the "Great Eastern," was got afloat on the 31st of
  January 1858. Much remained to be done to complete the ship; and her
  engineer, overworked and worn out with worry, broke down and did not see
  her begin her first voyage on the 7th of September 1859. On the 5th he
  was brought home from the ship suffering from a paralytic stroke, and on
  the 15th he died at his house in Westminster.</p>

  <p>In addition to the great works already described, Brunel was employed
  in the construction of many docks and piers, as at Monkwearmouth,
  Bristol, Plymouth, Briton Ferry, Brentford and Milford Haven. He was a
  zealous promoter of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and was a member of the
  committee on the section of machinery and of the building committee. He
  paid much attention to the improvement of large guns, and designed a
  floating gun-carriage for the attack on Kronstadt in the Russian War
  (1854); he also designed and superintended the construction of the
  hospital buildings at Erenkeni on the Dardanelles (1855). He was elected
  a fellow of the Royal Society in 1830, and in 1858 declined the
  presidency of the Institution of Civil Engineers through ill-health. He
  received the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford in 1857. In his work he was
  singularly free from professional jealousy, and was always ready to
  commend and help others, though, himself a man of remarkable industry and

  Brunel.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNEL, SIR MARC ISAMBARD</b> (1769-1849), British inventor and
  engineer, was born at Hacqueville in Normandy on the 25th of April 1769.
  His father, a small landowner and farmer, intended him for the church,
  but his taste for mathematics and mechanics inclined him to another
  career, and he obtained a nomination for the navy, in which he served for
  six years. When his ship was paid off in 1792 and he returned to France,
  he found the Revolution at its height, and owing to his pronounced
  royalist opinions he was obliged to leave the country. Reaching New York
  in September 1793 he began to practise as an architect and civil
  engineer. His first employment was in land-surveying and
  canal-engineering. Later he submitted a highly ornamental design for the
  National Capitol at Washington, which, however, was not accepted, and was
  engaged to design and superintend the construction of the Bowery theatre,
  New York, burnt down in 1821. He fitted novel and ingenious machinery in
  the arsenal and cannon factory which he was commissioned to erect in New
  York, and he was asked to supply plans for the defences of the Narrows
  between the upper and lower bays of that port. Early in 1799 he sailed
  for England in order to submit to the British government his plans for
  the mechanical production of ships' blocks, in substitution for the
  manual processes then employed. After the usual difficulties and delays
  his proposals were adopted, largely through the recommendation of Sir
  Samuel Bentham, and about 1803 the erection of his machines was begun at
  Portsmouth dockyard. They were constructed by Henry Maudslay, and formed
  one of the earliest examples of a complete range of machine tools, each
  <!-- Page 683 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page683"></a>[v.04
  p.0683]</span>performing its part in a long series of operations. Not
  only was the quality of the product much improved but the cost was
  greatly diminished, and the saving effected in the first year in which
  the machines were in full work was estimated at £24,000, of which about
  two-thirds was awarded to Brunel. A little later he was occupied in
  devising improved machines for sawing and bending timber, and in 1811 and
  1812 he was employed by the government in erecting saw-mills at Woolwich
  and Chatham, carrying out at the latter dockyard a complete
  reorganization of the system for handling timber. About 1812 he devised
  machinery for making boots which was adopted for the purposes of the
  army, but abandoned a few years later when, owing to the cessation of
  war, the demand became less and the supply of manual labour cheaper. At
  the same time he interested himself in the establishment of steam
  navigation on the Thames between London and Ramsgate. In 1814 he
  succeeded in persuading the admiralty to try steam-tugs for towing
  warships out to sea. The experiments were made at his own expense, for a
  few months after undertaking to contribute to the cost the admiralty
  revoked its promise on the ground that the attempt was "too chimerical to
  be seriously entertained." Another vain enterprise on which he wasted
  much time and money was an attempt to use liquefied gases as a source of
  motive power. His round stocking-frame or <i>tricoteur</i> was patented
  in 1816, and among his other inventions were machines for winding
  cotton-thread into balls, for copying drawings, for making small wooden
  boxes such as are used by druggists, and for the manufacture of nails,
  together with processes of preparing tinfoil for decorative purposes and
  improvements in stereotype plates for printing.</p>

  <p>In 1821, partly as the result of the damage done by fire in 1814 to
  the saw-mills he owned at Battersea, and partly because his commercial
  abilities were far from equal to his mechanical genius, he got into
  financial difficulties and was thrown into prison for debt, only
  regaining his freedom through a grant of £5000 which his friends obtained
  for him from the government. Subsequently his attention was mainly
  devoted to projects of civil engineering, the most noteworthy being the
  Thames Tunnel. In 1820 he had prepared plans of bridges for erection in
  Rouen and St Petersburg and in the island of Bourbon. In 1823 he designed
  swing-bridges, and in 1826 floating landing-stages, for the port of
  Liverpool. A company, which was supported by the duke of Wellington, was
  formed in 1824 to carry out his scheme for boring a tunnel under the
  Thames between Wapping and Rotherhithe. The work was begun at the
  beginning of 1825, the excavation being accomplished by the aid of a
  "shield," which he had patented in 1818. Many difficulties were
  encountered. The river broke through the roof of the tunnel in 1827, and
  after a second irruption in 1828 work was discontinued for lack of funds.
  Seven years later it was resumed with the aid of money advanced by the
  government, and after three more irruptions the tunnel was completed and
  opened in 1843. Aided by his son, Brunel displayed extraordinary skill
  and resource in the various emergencies with which he had to deal, but
  the anxiety broke down his health. He recovered sufficiently from one
  paralytic stroke to attend the opening ceremony, but he was able to
  undertake little more professional work. A second stroke followed in
  1845, and four years later he died in London on the 12th of December
  1849. He received the order of the Legion of Honour in 1829 and was
  knighted in 1841.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNELLESCHI</b> (or <span class="sc">Brunellesco</span>),
  <b>FILIPPO</b> (1379-1446), Italian architect, the reviver in Italy of
  the Roman or Classic style, was born at Florence in 1379. His father, a
  notary, had destined him for his own profession, but observing the boy's
  talent for all sorts of mechanism, placed him in the gild of goldsmiths.
  Filippo quickly became a skilled workman, and perfected himself in the
  knowledge of sculpture, perspective and geometry. He designed some
  portions of houses in Florence, and in 1401 he was one of the competitors
  for the design of the gates of the baptistery of San Giovanni. He was
  unsuccessful, though his work obtained praise, and he soon afterwards set
  out for Rome. He studied hard, and resolved to do what he could to revive
  the older classical style, which had died out in Italy. Moreover, he was
  one of the first to apply the scientific laws of perspective to his work.
  In 1407 he returned to Florence, just at the time when it was resolved to
  attempt the completion of the cathedral church of Santa Maria del Fiore.
  Brunelleschi's plan for effecting this by a cupola was approved, but it
  was not till 1419, and after innumerable disputes, that the work was
  finally entrusted to him. At first he was hampered by his colleague
  Ghiberti, of whom he skilfully got rid. He did not live to see the
  completion of his great work, and the lantern on the summit was put up
  not altogether in accordance with the instructions and plans left by him.
  The great cupola, one of the triumphs of architecture, exceeds in some
  measurements that of St Peter's at Rome, and has a more massive and
  striking appearance. Besides this masterpiece Brunelleschi executed
  numerous other works, among the most remarkable of which are the Pitti
  palace at Florence, on the pattern of which are based the Tuscan palaces
  of the 15th century, the churches of San Lorenzo and Spirito Santo, and
  the still more elegant Capella del Pazza. The beautiful carved crucifix
  in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence is also the work of
  Brunelleschi. He died in Florence on the 16th of April 1446, and was
  buried in the cathedral church of his native city.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNET, JACQUES CHARLES</b> (1780-1867), French bibliographer, was
  born in Paris on the 2nd of November 1780. He was the son of a
  bookseller, and in 1802 he printed a supplement to the <i>Dictionnaire
  bibiographique de livres rares</i> (1790) of Duclos and Cailleau. In 1810
  there appeared the first edition of his <i>Manuel du libraire et de
  l'amateur des livres</i> (3 vols.). Brunet published successive editions
  of his great bibliographical dictionary, which rapidly came to be
  recognized as the first book of its class in European literature. He died
  on the 14th of November 1867. Among his other works are <i>Nouvelles
  Recherches bibliographiques</i> (1834), <i>Recherches ... sur les
  éditions originales ... de Rabelais</i> (1852), and an edition of the
  French poems of J.G. Alione d'Asti, dating from the beginning of the 16th
  century (1836).</p>

  (1868) of his own valuable library. A supplement to the 5th edition
  (1860-1865) of the <i>Manuel du libraire</i> was published (1878-1880) by
  P. Deschamps and G. Brunet.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNETIÈRE, FERDINAND</b> (1849-1906), French critic and man of
  letters, was born at Toulon on the 19th July 1849. After attending a
  school at Marseilles, he studied in Paris at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand.
  Desiring to follow the profession of teaching, he entered for examination
  at the École Normale Supérieure, but failed, and the outbreak of war in
  1870 debarred him from a second attempt. He turned to private tuition and
  to literary criticism. After the publication of successful articles in
  the <i>Revue Bleue</i>, he became connected with the <i>Revue des Deux
  Mondes</i>, first as contributor, then as secretary and sub-editor, and
  finally, in 1893, as principal editor. In 1886 he was appointed professor
  of French language and literature at the École Normale, a singular honour
  for one who had not passed through the academic mill; and later he
  presided with distinction over various <i>conférences</i> at the Sorbonne
  and elsewhere. He was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1887, and
  became a member of the Academy in 1893. The published works of M.
  Brunetière consist largely of reprinted papers and lectures. They include
  six series of <i>Études critiques</i> (1880-1898) on French history and
  literature; <i>Le Roman naturaliste</i> (1883); <i>Histoire et
  Littérature</i>, three series (1884-1886); <i>Questions de critique</i>
  (1888; second series, 1890). The first volume of <i>L'Évolution de genres
  dans l'histoire de la littérature</i>, lectures in which a formal
  classification, founded on the Darwinian theory, is applied to the
  phenomena of literature, appeared in 1890; and his later works include a
  series of studies (2 vols., 1894) on the evolution of French lyrical
  poetry during the 19th century, a history of <!-- Page 684 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page684"></a>[v.04 p.0684]</span>French classic
  literature begun in 1904, a monograph on Balzac (1906), and various
  pamphlets of a polemical nature dealing with questions of education,
  science and religion. Among these may be mentioned <i>Discours
  académiques</i> (1901), <i>Discours de combat</i> (1900, 1903),
  <i>L'Action sociale du christianisme</i> (1904), <i>Sur les chemins de la
  croyance</i> (1905). M. Brunetière was an orthodox Roman Catholic, and
  his political sympathies were in the main reactionary. He possessed two
  prime qualifications of a great critic, vast erudition and unflinching
  courage. He was never afraid to diverge from the established critical
  view, his mind was closely logical and intensely accurate, and he rarely
  made a trip in the wide field of study over which it ranged. The most
  honest, if not the most impartial, of magisterial writers, he had a
  hatred of the unreal, and a contempt for the trivial; nobody was more
  merciless towards those who affected effete and decadent literary forms,
  or maintained a vicious standard of art. On the other hand, his
  intolerance, his sledge-hammer methods of attack and a certain dry
  pedantry alienated the sympathies of many who recognized the remarkable
  qualities of his mind. The application of universal principles to every
  question of letters is a check to dilettante habits of thought, but it is
  apt to detain the critic in a somewhat narrow and dusty path. M.
  Brunetière's influence, however, cannot be disputed, and it was in the
  main thoroughly sound and wholesome. He died on the 9th of December
  1906.</p>

  <p>His <i>Manual of the History of French Literature</i> was translated
  into English in 1898 by R. Derechef. Among critics of Brunetière see J.
  Lemaître, <i>Les Contemporains</i> (1887, &amp;c.), and J. Sargeret,
  <i>Les Grands Corvertis</i> (1906).</p>

  <p><b>BRUNHILD</b> (M.H. Ger. <i>Brünhilt</i> or <i>Prünhilt</i>, Nor.
  <i>Brynhildr</i>), the name of a mythical heroine of various versions of
  the legend of the Nibelungs. The name means "the warrior woman in armour"
  (from O.H. Ger. <i>brunjô</i>, <i>brunja</i>, M.H. Ger. <i>brunige</i>,
  <i>brünje</i>, <i>brünne</i>, a cuirass or coat of mail, O. Eng.
  <i>byrnie</i>, and O.H. Ger. <i>hiltja</i>, <i>hilta</i>, war), and in
  the Norse versions of the Nibelung myth, which preserves more of the
  primitive traditions than the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, Brunhild is a
  valkyrie, the daughter of Odin, by whom, as a punishment for having
  against his orders helped a warrior to victory, she has been cast under a
  spell of sleep on Hindarfjell, a lonely rock summit, until the destined
  hero shall penetrate the wall of fire by which she is surrounded, and
  wake her. This is a variant of the widespread myth which survives in the
  popular fairy-story of "the sleeping beauty." The ingenuity of some
  German scholars has made of Brunhild a personification of the day, held
  prisoner upon the hill-tops till in the morning the sun-god comes to her
  rescue, then triumphing with him awhile, only to pass once more under the
  spell of the powers of mist and darkness. She is thus by some
  commentators contrasted with "the masked warrior woman" Kriemhild
  (<i>q.v.</i>), a personification of the power of night and death. But
  whatever be the dim original of the character of Brunhild&mdash;as to
  which authorities are by no means agreed&mdash;even in the northern
  versions its mythical interest is quite subordinate to its purely human
  interest. In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> she is the heroine of a tragedy of
  passion and wounded pride; it is she who compasses the death of Sigurd,
  who has broken his troth plighted to her, and then immolates herself on
  his funeral pyre in order that in the world of the dead he may be wholly
  hers. In the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, on the other hand, she plays a
  comparatively colourless rôle. She still possesses superhuman attributes:
  like Atalanta, she can only be won by the man who is able to overcome her
  in trials of speed and strength; but, instead of a valkyrie sleeping on a
  lonely rock, she is, when Sigfrid goes to woo her on behalf of Gunther,
  queen of Îslant (Îsenlant), living in a castle called the Isenstein. In
  the tragedy of the death of Sigfrid her part is completely overshadowed
  by that of "the grim Hagen," and from the moment that the murder is
  decided on she drops almost completely out of the story. The poet of the
  <i>Nibelungenlied</i> evidently knew nothing of the tale of her
  self-immolation; for, though he has nothing definite to say about her
  after Sigfrid's death, he keeps her alive in a sort of dignified
  retirement. In the last 5000 lines or so of the poem Brunhild is only
  mentioned four times and takes no active part in the story. (See further
  under <span class="sc">Nibelungenlied</span>.)</p>

  <p>(W. A. P.)</p>

  <p><b>BRUNHILDA</b> (Brunechildis), queen of Austrasia (d. 613), was a
  daughter of Athanagild, king of the Visigoths. In 567 she was asked in
  marriage by Sigebert, who was reigning at Metz. She now abjured Arianism
  and was converted to the orthodox faith, and the union was celebrated at
  Metz; on which occasion Fortunatus, an Italian poet, who was then at the
  Frankish court, composed the epithalamium. Chilperic, brother of
  Sigebert, and king of the west Frankish kingdom, jealous of the renown
  which this marriage brought to his elder brother, hastened to ask the
  hand of Galswintha, sister of Brunhilda; but at the instigation of his
  mistress Fredegond, he assassinated his wife. Sigebert was anxious to
  avenge his sister-in-law, but on the intervention of Guntram, he accepted
  the compensation offered by Chilperic, namely the cities of Bordeaux,
  Cahors and Limoges, with Béarn and Bigorre.</p>

  <p>This treaty did not prevent war soon again breaking out between
  Sigebert and Chilperic. So long as her husband lived, Brunhilda played a
  secondary part, but having been made captive by Chilperic after her
  husband's assassination (575), she succeeded in escaping from her prison
  at Rouen, after a series of extraordinary adventures, by means of a
  marriage with Merovech, the son of her conqueror. From this time on, she
  took the lead; in Austrasia she engaged in a desperate struggle against
  the nobles, who wished to govern in the name of her son Childebert II.;
  but she was worsted in the conflict and for some time had to seek refuge
  in Burgundy. After the death of Childebert II. (597) she aspired to
  govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons Theudebert and
  Theuderich II. She was expelled from Austrasia, and then stirred up
  Theuderich II. against his brother, whom he defeated at Toul and Tolbiac,
  and put to death. Theuderich II. died shortly after this victory, and
  Brunhilda caused one of her great-grandchildren to be proclaimed king.
  The nobles of Austrasia and Burgundy, however, now summoned Clotaire II.,
  son of Fredegond, and king of Neustria, to help them against the queen.
  Brunhilda was given up to him, and died a terrible death, being dragged
  at the heels of a wild horse (613).</p>

  <p>Brunhilda seems to have had political ideas, and to have wished to
  attain to the royal power. She was a protectress of the Church, and Pope
  Gregory I. (590-604) addressed a series of letters to her, in which he
  showered praises upon her. She took it upon herself, however, to
  supervise the bishoprics and monasteries, and came into conflict with
  Columban (Columbanus), abbot of Luxeuil. As Brunhilda was a great queen,
  tradition ascribes to her the construction of many old castles, and a
  number of old Roman roads are also known by the name of <i>Chaussées de
  Brunehaut</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNI, LEONARDO</b> (1369-1444), Italian scholar, author of the
  <i>History of Florence</i>, was born at Arezzo, and is generally known as
  Leonardo Aretino. He was secretary to the papal chancery under Innocent
  VII. and John XXII. From 1427 to his death in 1444 he was chancellor to
  the republic of Florence. He was buried at the expense of the state in
  Sta Croce, where his laurelled statue is still to be seen. He was the
  first to free the history of Florence from its fabulous elements, but his
  book, though not unintelligent, only repays very laborious study. The
  only Latin edition is <i>Historiarum Florentinarum libri xii ... exempto

  translation into Tuscan was published by Donato Acciajuoli in 1476 at
  Venice, was republished at Florence in 1492, and again, with Sansovino's
  continuation, at Venice in 1561.</p>

  situated for the most part between two hills at the confluence of the
  Schwarzawa and the Zwittawa, and consists of <!-- Page 685 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page685"></a>[v.04 p.0685]</span>the old town
  and extensive suburbs. On one of the hills, known as the Spielberg (945
  ft.), stands a castle which has long been used as a prison, famous for
  its connexion with Silvio Pellico, who was confined within its walls from
  1822 to 1830. The fortifications of the old town have now been entirely
  removed, giving place to handsome gardens and well-built streets, which
  put it in communication with its adjoining suburbs. The old town,
  although comparatively small, with narrow and crooked but well-paved
  streets, contains the most important buildings in the city. The Rathaus,
  which dates from 1511, has a fine Gothic portal, and contains several
  interesting antiquities. The ecclesiastical buildings comprise the
  cathedral of St Peter, situated on the lower hill; the fine Gothic church
  of St Jacob, built in the 15th century, with its iron tower added in
  1845, and a remarkable collection of early prints; the church of the
  Augustinian friars, dating from the 14th century; and that of the
  Minorites, with its frescoes, its holy stair and its Loretto-house.
  Amongst the new buildings are the hall of the provincial diet, opened in
  1881; a handsome new synagogue; the national museum of Moravia and
  Silesia and several high educational establishments, including a
  technical academy and a theological seminary, which are the remnants of
  the former university of Brünn. It is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop
  and of a Protestant consistory. Brünn, which is sometimes styled "the
  Austrian Manchester," is one of the most industrial towns of Austria and
  the chief seat of the cloth industry in the whole empire. Other important
  branches of industry are: the manufacture of various woollen, cotton and
  silk goods, leather, the machinery required in the textile factories,
  brewing, distilling and milling, and the production of sugar, oil, gloves
  and hardware. It is also an important railway junction and carries on a
  very active trade.</p>

  <p>Brünn probably dates from the 9th century. In the 11th century it was
  bestowed by Duke Wratislas II. on his son Otto. A place of great
  strength, it held out successfully against sieges&mdash;in 1428 by the
  Hussites, in 1467 by King George of Bohemia, in 1645 by the Swedish
  general Torstenson, and in 1742 by the Prussians. In 1805 it was the
  headquarters of Napoleon before the battle of Austerlitz.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNNER, HENRY</b> (1840- ), German historian, was born at Wels in
  Upper Austria on the 22nd of June 1840. After studying at the
  universities of Vienna, Göttingen and Berlin, he became professor at the
  university of Lemberg in 1866, and in quick succession held similar
  positions at Prague, Strassburg and Berlin. From 1872 Brunner devoted
  himself especially to studying the early laws and institutions of the
  Franks and kindred peoples of western Europe, and on these subjects his
  researches have been of supreme value. He also became a leading authority
  on modern German law. He became a member of the Berlin Academy of
  Sciences in 1884, and in 1886, after the death of G. Waitz, undertook the
  supervision of the <i>Leges</i> section of the <i>Monumenta Germaniae
  historica</i>. His chief works are: <i>Die Entstehung der

  <p><b>BRÜNNOW, FRANZ FRIEDRICH ERNST</b> (1821-1891), German astronomer,
  was born in Berlin on the 18th of November 1821. Between the ages of
  eight and eighteen he attended the Friedrich-Wilhelm gymnasium. In 1839
  he entered the university of Berlin, where he studied mathematics,
  astronomy and physics, as well as chemistry, philosophy and philology.
  After graduating as Ph.D. in 1843, he took an active part in astronomical
  work at the Berlin observatory, under the direction of J. F. Encke,
  contributing numerous important papers on the orbits of comets and minor
  planets to the <i>Astronomische Nachrichten</i>. In 1847 he was appointed
  director of the Bilk observatory, near Düsseldorf, and in the following
  year published the well-known <i>Mémoire sur la comète elliptique de De
  Vico</i>, for which he received the gold medal of the Amsterdam Academy.
  In 1851 he succeeded J. G. Galle as first assistant at the Berlin
  observatory, and accepted in 1854 the post of director of the new
  observatory at Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. Here he published, 1858-1862,
  a journal entitled <i>Astronomical Notices</i>, while his tables of the
  minor planets Flora, Victoria and Iris were severally issued in 1857,
  1859 and 1869. In 1860 he went, as associate director of the observatory,
  to Albany, N. Y.; but returned in 1861 to Michigan, and threw himself
  with vigour into the work of studying the astronomical and physical
  constants of the observatory and its instruments. In 1863 he resigned its
  direction and returned to Germany; then, on the death of Sir W. R.
  Hamilton in 1865, he accepted the post of Andrews professor of astronomy
  in the university of Dublin and astronomer-royal of Ireland. His first
  undertaking at the Dublin observatory was the erection of an equatorial
  telescope to carry the fine object-glass presented to the university by
  Sir James South; and on its completion he began an important series of
  researches on stellar parallax. The first, second and third parts of the
  <i>Astronomical Observations and Researches made at Dunsink</i> contain
  the results of these labours, and include discussions of the distances of
  the stars <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> Lyrae, <span

  <p><b>BRUNO, SAINT,</b> founder of the Carthusians, was born in Cologne
  about 1030; he was educated there and afterwards at Reims and Tours,
  where he studied under Berengar. He was ordained at Cologne, and thence,
  in 1057, he was recalled to Reims to become <i>scholasticus</i>, or head
  of the cathedral school, and overseer of the schools of the diocese. He
  was made also canon and diocesan chancellor. Having protested against the
  misdoings of a new archbishop, he was deprived of all his offices and had
  to fly for safety (1076). On the deposition of the archbishop in 1080,
  Bruno was presented by the ecclesiastical authorities to the pope for the
  see, but Philip I. of France successfully opposed the appointment. After
  this Bruno left Reims and retired, with six companions, to a desert among
  the mountains near Grenoble, and there founded the Carthusian order
  (1084). After six years Urban II. called him to Rome and offered him the
  archbishopric of Reggio; but he refused it, and withdrew to a desert in
  Calabria, where he established two other monasteries, and died in 1101.
  He wrote Commentaries on the Psalms and the Pauline Epistles, to be found
  in Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i> clii. and cliii.; some works by namesakes
  have been attributed to him.</p>

  <p>His Life will be found in the Bollandists' <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> (6th
  of October). The best study on St Bruno's life and works is Hermann
  Löbbel, <i>Der Stifter des Karthäuser-Ordens</i>, 1899 (vol. v. No. 1 of

  <p><b>BRUNO,</b> or <span class="sc">Brun</span> (925-965), archbishop of
  Cologne, third son of the German king, Henry I., the Fowler, by his
  second wife Matilda, was educated for the church at Utrecht, where he
  <!-- Page 686 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page686"></a>[v.04
  p.0686]</span>distinguished himself by his studious zeal. In 940 his
  brother, King Otto, afterwards the emperor Otto the Great, appointed him
  chancellor, and some years later arch-chaplain, and under his leadership
  the chancery was reformed and became a training ground for capable
  administrators. He rendered valuable assistance to his brother Otto in
  his efforts to suppress the risings which marked the earlier part of his
  reign, services which were rewarded in 953 when Bruno was made archbishop
  of Cologne, and about the same time duke of Lorraine. Bruno is chiefly
  renowned as a scholar and a patron of learning. He consorted eagerly with
  learned foreigners, tried to secure a better education for the clergy,
  and was mainly instrumental in making his brother's court a centre of
  intellectual life. He built many churches, and, aided by the tendency of
  the time, sought to purify monastic life. He died at Reims on the 11th of
  October 965, and was buried in the church of St Pantaleon at Cologne.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNO, GIORDANO</b> (c. 1548-1600), Italian philosopher of the
  Renaissance, was born near Nola in the village of Cicala. Little is known
  of his life. He was christened Filippo, and took the name Giordano only
  on entering a religious order. In his fifteenth year he entered the order
  of the Dominicans at Naples, and is said to have composed a treatise on
  the ark of Noah. Why he submitted to a discipline palpably unsuited to
  his fiery spirit we cannot tell. In consequence of his views on
  transubstantiation and the immaculate conception he was accused of
  impiety, and after enduring persecution for some years, he fled from Rome
  about 1576, and wandered through various cities, reaching Geneva in 1579.
  The home of Calvinism was no resting-place for him (T. Dufour,
  <i>Giordano Bruno à Genève</i>, Geneva, 1884), and he travelled on
  through Lyons, Toulouse and Montpellier, arriving at Paris in 1581.
  Everywhere he bent his energies to the exposition of the new thoughts
  which were beginning to effect a revolution in the thinking world. He had
  drunk deeply of the spirit of the Renaissance, the determination to see
  for himself the noble universe, unclouded by the mists of authoritative
  philosophy and church tradition. The discoveries of Copernicus were
  eagerly accepted by him, and he used them as the lever by which to push
  aside the antiquated system that had come down from Aristotle, for whom,
  indeed, he had a perfect hatred. Like Bacon and Telesio he preferred the
  older Greek philosophers, who had looked at nature for themselves, and
  whose speculations had more of reality in them. He had read widely and
  deeply, and in his own writings we come across many expressions familiar
  to us in earlier systems. Yet his philosophy is no eclecticism. He owed
  something to Lucretius, something to the Stoic nature-pantheism,
  something to Anaxagoras, to Heraclitus, to the Pythagoreans, and to the
  Neoplatonists, who were partially known to him; above all, he was a
  profound student of Nicolas of Cusa, who was indeed a speculative
  Copernicus. But his own system has a distinct unity and originality; it
  breathes throughout the fiery spirit of Bruno himself.</p>

  <p>Bruno had been well received at Toulouse, where he had lectured on
  astronomy; even better fortune awaited him at Paris, especially at the
  hands of Henry III. He was offered a chair of philosophy, provided he
  would receive the Mass. He at once refused, but was permitted to deliver
  lectures. These seem to have been altogether devoted to expositions of a
  certain logical system which Bruno had taken up with great eagerness, the
  <i>Ars Magna</i> of Raimon Lull. With the exception of a satiric comedy,
  <i>Il Candelajo</i>, all the works of this period are devoted to this
  logic&mdash;<i>De Umbris Idearum, Ars Memoriae, De compendiosa
  architectura et complemento artis Lullii</i>, and <i>Cantus Circaeus</i>.
  To many it has seemed a curious freak of Bruno's that he should have so
  eagerly adopted a view of thought like that of Lull, but in reality it is
  in strict accordance with the principles of his philosophy. Like the
  Arabian logicians, and some of the scholastics, who held that ideas
  existed in a threefold form&mdash;<i>ante res</i>, <i>in rebus</i> and
  <i>post res</i>&mdash;he laid down the principle that the archetypal
  ideas existed metaphysically in the ultimate unity or intelligence,
  physically in the world of things, and logically in signs, symbols or
  notions. These notions were shadows of the ideas, and the <i>Ars
  Magna</i> furnished him with a general scheme, according to which their
  relations and correspondences should be exhibited. It supplied not only a
  <i>memoria technica</i>, but an <i>organon</i>, or method by which the
  genesis of all ideas from unity might be represented intelligibly and
  easily. It provided also a substitute for either the Aristotelian or the
  Ramist logic, which was an additional element in its favour.</p>

  <p>Under the protection of the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau,
  sieur de Mauvissière, Bruno passed over in 1583 to England, where he
  resided for about two years. He was disgusted with the brutality of
  English manners, which he paints in no flattering colours, and he found
  pedantry and superstition as rampant in Oxford as in Geneva. Indeed,
  there still existed on the statute a provision that "Masters and
  Bachelors who did not follow Aristotle faithfully were liable to a fine
  of five shillings for every point of divergence, and for every fault
  committed against the logic of the Organon." But he indulges in
  extravagant eulogies of Elizabeth. He is generally said to have formed
  the acquaintance of Sir Philip Sidney, Fulke Greville and other eminent
  Englishmen, but there has been much controversy as to the facts of his
  life in London. It seems probable that he lived in the French embassy in
  some secretarial or tutorial position. He may conceivably have met Bacon,
  but it is quite incredible that he met Shakespeare in the printing shop
  of Thomas Vautrollier. In Oxford he was allowed to hold a disputation
  with some learned doctors on the rival merits of the Copernican and
  so-called Aristotelian systems of the universe, and, according to his own
  report, had an easy victory. The best of his works were written in the
  freedom of English social life. The <i>Cena de le Ceneri</i>, or Ash
  Wednesday conversation, devoted to an exposition of the Copernican
  theory, was printed in 1584. In the same year appeared his two great
  metaphysical works, <i>De la Causa, Principio, ed Uno</i>, and <i>De
  l'Infinito, Universo, e Mondi</i>; in the year following the <i>Eroici
  Furori</i> and <i>Cabala del Cavallo Pegaseo</i>. In 1584 also appeared
  the strange dialogue, <i>Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante</i>
  (<i>Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast</i>), an allegory treating chiefly
  of moral philosophy, but giving the essence of Bruno's philosophy. The
  gods are represented as resolving to banish from the heavens the
  constellations, which served to remind them of their evil deeds. In their
  places are put the moral virtues. The first of the three dialogues
  contains the substance of the allegory, which, under the disguise of an
  assault on heathen mythology, is a direct attack on all forms of
  anthropomorphic religion. But in a philosophical point of view the first
  part of the second dialogue is the most important. Among the moral
  virtues which take the place of the beasts are Truth, Prudence, Wisdom,
  Law and Universal Judgment, and in the explanation of what these mean
  Bruno unfolds the inner essence of his system. Truth is the unity and
  substance which underlies all things; Prudence or Providence is the
  regulating power of truth, and comprehends both liberty and necessity;
  Wisdom is providence itself in its supersensible aspect&mdash;in man it
  is reason which grasps the truth of things; Law results from wisdom, for
  no good law is irrational, and its sole end and aim is the good of
  mankind; Universal Judgment is the principle whereby men are judged
  according to their deeds, and not according to their belief in this or
  that catechism. Mingled with his allegorical philosophy are the most
  vehement attacks upon the established religion. The monks are stigmatized
  as pedants who would destroy the joy of life on earth, who are
  avaricious, dissolute and the breeders of eternal dissensions and
  squabbles. The mysteries of faith are scoffed at. The Jewish records are
  put on a level with the Greek myths, and miracles are laughed at as
  magical tricks. Through all this runs the train of thought resulting
  naturally from Bruno's fundamental principles, and familiar in modern
  philosophy as Spinozism, the denial of particular providence, the
  doctrine of the uselessness of prayer, the identification in a sense of
  liberty and necessity, and the peculiar definition of good and evil.</p>

  <p>In 1585-1586 he returned with Castelnau to Paris, where his
  anti-Aristotelian views were taken up by the college of Cambrai, but was
  soon driven from his refuge, and we next find him at Marburg and
  Wittenberg, the headquarters of Lutheranism. There is a tradition that
  here or in England he embraced the Protestant faith; nothing in his
  writings would lead one to suppose so. Several works, chiefly logical,
  appeared during his stay at Wittenberg (<i>De Lampade combinatoria
  Lulliana</i>, 1587, and <i>De Progressu et Lampade venatoria
  logicorum</i>, 1587). In 1588 he went to Prague, then to Helmstadt. In
  1591 he was at Frankfort, and published three important metaphysical
  works, <i>De Triplici Minimo et Mensura</i>; <i>De Monade, Numero, et
  Figura</i>; <i>De Immenso et Innumerabilibus</i>. He did not stay long at
  Prague, and we find him next at Zürich, whence he accepted an invitation
  to Venice from a young patrician, Giovanni Mocenigo. It was a rash step.
  The emissaries of the Inquisition were on his track; he was thrown into
  prison, and in 1593 was brought to Rome. Seven years were spent in
  confinement. On the 9th of February 1600 he was excommunicated, and on
  the 17th was burned at the stake.</p>

  <p>For more than two centuries Bruno received scarcely the consideration
  he deserved. On the 9th of June 1889, however, as a result of a strong
  popular movement, a statue to him was unveiled in Rome in the Campo dei
  Fiori, the place of his execution.</p>

  <p>To Bruno, as to all great thinkers, philosophy is the search for
  unity. Amid all the varying and contradictory phenomena of the universe
  there is something which gives coherence and intelligibility to them. Nor
  can this unity be something apart from the things; it must contain in
  itself the universe, which develops from it; it must be at once all and
  one. This unity is God, the universal substance,&mdash;the one and only
  principle, or <i>causa immanens</i>,&mdash;that which is in things and
  yet is distinct from them as the universal is distinct from the
  particular. He is the efficient and final cause of all, the beginning,
  middle, and end, eternal and infinite. By his action the world is
  produced, and his action is the law of his nature, his necessity is true
  freedom. He is living, active intelligence, the principle of motion and
  creation, realizing himself in the infinitely various forms of activity
  that constitute individual things. To the infinitely actual there is
  necessary the possible; that which determines involves somewhat in which
  its determinations can have existence. This other of God, which is in
  truth one with him, is matter. The universe, then, is a living cosmos, an
  infinitely animated system, whose end is the perfect realization of the
  variously graduated forms. The unity which sunders itself into the
  multiplicity of things may be called the <i>monas monadum</i>, each thing
  being a <i>monas</i> or self-existent, living being, a universe in
  itself. Of these monads the number is infinite. The soul of man is a
  thinking monad, and stands mid-way between the divine intelligence and
  the world of external things. As a portion of the divine life, the soul
  is immortal. Its highest function is the contemplation of the divine
  unity, discoverable under the manifold of objects.</p>

  <p>Such is a brief summary of the principal positions of Bruno's
  philosophy. It seems quite clear that in the earlier works, particularly
  the two Italian dialogues, he approached more nearly to the pantheistic
  view of things than in his later Latin treatises. The unity expounded at
  first is simply an <i>anima mundi</i>, a living universe, but not
  intelligent. There is a distinct development traceable towards the later
  and final form of his doctrine, in which the universe appears as the
  realization of the divine mind.</p>

  <p>Bruno's writings had been much neglected when Jacobi brought them into
  notice in his <i>Briefe über die Lehre Spinozas</i> (2nd ed., 1879).
  Since then many have held that Descartes, Spinoza and Leibnitz were
  indebted to him for their main principles. So far as Descartes is
  concerned, it is highly improbable that he had seen any of Bruno's works.
  Schelling, however, called one of his works after him, <i>Bruno</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNO</b> (<span class="sc">Brun, Bruns</span>) <b>OF QUERFURT,
  SAINT</b> (c. 975-1009), German missionary bishop and martyr, belonged to
  the family of the lords of Querfurt in Saxony. He was educated at the
  famous cathedral school at Magdeburg, and at the age of twenty was
  attached to the clerical household of the emperor Otto III. In 996 he
  accompanied the emperor to Rome, and there gave up his post and entered
  the monastery of SS. Alexius and Bonifacius on the Aventine, taking "in
  religion" the name of Bonifacius. When the news reached Rome of the
  martyrdom of Adalbert, bishop of Prague (997), Bruno determined to take
  his place, and in 1004, after being consecrated by the pope as archbishop
  of the eastern heathen, he set out for Germany to seek aid of the emperor
  Henry II. The emperor, however, being at war with Boleslaus of Poland,
  opposed his enterprise, and he went first to the court of St Stephen of
  Hungary, and, finding but slight encouragement there, to that of the
  grand prince Vladimir at Kiev. He made no effort to win over Vladimir to
  the Roman obedience, but devoted himself to the conversion of the pagan
  Pechenegs who inhabited the country between the Don and the Danube. In
  this he was so far successful that they made peace with the grand prince
  and were for a while nominally Christians. In 1008 Bruno went to the
  court of Boleslaus, and, after a vain effort to persuade the emperor to
  end the war between Germans and Poles, determined at all hazards to
  proceed with his mission to the Prussians. With eighteen companions he
  set out; but on the borders of the Russian (Lithuanian) country he and
  all his company were massacred by the heathens (February 14, 1009).</p>

  <p>During his stay in Hungary (1004) Bruno wrote a life of St Adalbert,
  the best of the three extant biographies of the saint (in Pertz, <i>Mon.
  Germ. Hist. Scriptores</i>, iv. pp. 577, 596-612), described by A.
  Potthast (<i>Bibliotheca hist. med. aev.</i>) as "in the highest degree
  attractive both in manner and matter."</p>

  <p>A life of St Bruno was written by Dietmar, bishop of Merseburg
  (976-1019). This, with additions from the life of St Romuald, is
  published in the Bollandist <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> (June 19), vi. 1, pp.
  223-225. See further U. Chevalier, <i>Répertoire des sources historiques,

  <p><b>BRUNSWICK, KARL WILHELM FERDINAND,</b> <span class="sc">Duke
  of</span> (1735-1806), German general, was born on the 9th of October
  1735 at Wolfenbüttel. He received an unusually wide and thorough
  education, and travelled in his youth in Holland, France and various
  parts of Germany. His first military experience was in the North German
  campaign of 1757, under the duke of Cumberland. At the battle of
  Hastenbeck he won great renown by a gallant charge at the head of an
  infantry brigade; <!-- Page 688 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page688"></a>[v.04 p.0688]</span>and upon the capitulation of
  Kloster Zeven he was easily persuaded by his uncle Ferdinand of
  Brunswick, who succeeded Cumberland, to continue in the war as a general
  officer. The exploits of the hereditary prince, as he was called, soon
  gained him further reputation, and he became an acknowledged master of
  irregular warfare. In pitched battles, and in particular at Minden and
  Warburg, he proved himself an excellent subordinate. After the close of
  the Seven Years' War, the prince visited England with his bride, the
  daughter of Frederick, prince of Wales, and in 1766 he went to France,
  being received both by his allies and his late enemies with every token
  of respect. In Paris he made the acquaintance of Marmontel; in
  Switzerland, whither he continued his tour, that of Voltaire; and in Rome
  , where he remained for a long time, he explored the antiquities of the
  city under the guidance of Winckelmann. After a visit to Naples he
  returned to Paris, and thence, with his wife, to Brunswick. His services
  to the dukedom during the next few years were of the greatest value; with
  the assistance of the minister Féronce von Rotenkreuz he rescued the
  state from the bankruptcy into which the war had brought it. His
  popularity was unbounded, and when he succeeded his father, Duke Karl I.,
  in 1780, he soon became known as a model to sovereigns. He was perhaps
  the best representative of the benevolent despot of the 18th
  century&mdash;wise, economical, prudent and kindly. His habitual caution,
  if it induced him on some occasions to leave reforms uncompleted, at any
  rate saved him from the failures which marred the efforts of so many
  liberal princes of his time. He strove to keep his duchy from all foreign
  entanglements. At the same time he continued to render important services
  to the king of Prussia, for whom he had fought in the Seven Years' War;
  he was a Prussian field marshal, and was at pains to make the regiment of
  which he was colonel a model one, and he was frequently engaged in
  diplomatic and other state affairs. He resembled his uncle Frederick the
  Great in many ways, but he lacked the supreme resolution of the king, and
  in civil as in military affairs was prone to excessive caution. As an
  enthusiastic adherent of the Germanic and anti-Austrian policy of Prussia
  he joined the <i>Fürstenbund</i>, in which, as he now had the reputation
  of being the best soldier of his time, he was the destined
  commander-in-chief of the federal army.</p>

  <p>Between 1763 and 1787 his only military service had been in the brief
  War of the Bavarian Succession; in the latter year, however, the Duke, as
  a Prussian field marshal, led the army which invaded Holland. His success
  was rapid, complete and almost bloodless, and in the eyes of
  contemporaires the campaign appeared as an example of perfect
  generalship. Five years later Brunswick was appointed to the command of
  the allied Austrian and German army assembled to invade France and crush
  the Revolution. In this task he knew that he must encounter more than a
  formal resistance. He was so far in acknowledged sympathy with French
  hopes of reform, that when he gave an asylum in his duchy to the "comte
  de Lille" (Louis XVIII.) the revolutionary government made no protest.
  Indeed, earlier this year (1792) he had been offered supreme command of
  the French army. As the king of Prussia took the field with Brunswick's
  army, the duke felt bound as a soldier to treat his wishes as actual
  orders. (For the events of the Valmy campaign see <span class="sc">French
  Revolutionary Wars</span>). The result of Brunswick's cautious advance on
  Paris was the cannonade of Valmy followed by a retreat of the allies. The
  following campaign of 1793 showed his perhaps at his best as a careful
  and exact general; even the fiery Hoche, with the "nation in arms" behind
  him, failed to make any impression on the veteran leader of the allies.
  But difficulties and disagreements at headquarters multiplied, and when
  Brunswick found himself unable to move or direct his army without
  interference from the king, he laid down his command and returned to
  govern his duchy. He did not, however, withdraw entirely from Prussian
  service, and in 1803 he carried out a successful and diplomatic mission
  to Russia. In 1806, at the personal request of Queen Louise of Prussia,
  he consented to command the Prussian army, but here again the presence of
  the king of Prussia and the conflicting views of numerous advisers of
  high rank proved fatal. At the battle of Auerstadt the old duke was
  mortally wounded. Carried for nearly a month in the midst of the routed
  Prussian army he died at last on the 10th of November 1806 at Ottensen
  near Hamburg.</p>

  <p>His son and successor, <span class="sc">Friedrich Wilhelm</span>
  (1771-1815), who was one of the bitterest opponents of Napoleonic
  domination in Germany, took part in the war of 1809 at the head of a
  corps of partisans; fled to England after the battle of Wagram, and
  returned to Brunswick in 1813, where he raised fresh troops. He was
  killed at the battle of Quatre Bras on the 16th of June 1815.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNSWICK,</b> a city and the county-seat of Glynn county, Georgia,
  U.S.A., and a port of entry, on St Simon Sound, about 12 m. from the
  Atlantic Ocean, and about 100 m. S. of Savannah. Pop. (1890) 8459; (1900)
  9081, of whom 5184 were of negro descent; (1910 U.S. census) 10,182. It
  is one of the seaports of Georgia, the Federal government having dredged
  a channel in the inner harbour 21 ft. deep at mean low water and a
  channel across the outer bar 19.3 ft. deep at mean low water&mdash;there
  is a rise of 7.2 ft. at high tide. St Simon Island and Jekyl Island (a
  winter resort of wealthy men), lying between the ocean and the mainland,
  protect the harbour. The city is served by the Southern, the Atlanta,
  Birmingham &amp; Atlantic, and the Atlantic Coast Line railways; it is
  also connected by lines of steamboats with various ports along the coast,
  including New York and Boston. Brunswick's growth has been retarded by
  the successful rivalry of other cities, notably Savannah; but it has a
  considerable export trade, principally in lumber, cross-ties and naval
  stores&mdash;its exports were valued at $13,387,838 in 1908&mdash;and
  various manufactories, including planing mills, cooperage works and
  oyster canneries. It was settled about 1772, and received a city charter
  in 1856.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNSWICK</b> (Ger. <i>Braunschweig</i>), a sovereign duchy of
  northern Germany, and a constituent state of the German empire,
  comprising three larger and six smaller portions of territory. The
  principal or northern part, containing the towns of Brunswick,
  Wolfenbüttel and Helmstedt, is situated between the Prussian provinces of
  Hanover and Saxony to the south-east of the former. The western part,
  containing Holzminden and Gandersheim, extends eastward from the river
  Weser to Goslar. The Blankenburg, or eastern portion, lies to the
  south-east of the two former, between Prussia, the duchy of Anhalt and
  the Prussian province of Hanover. The six small enclaves, lying in the
  Prussian provinces of Hanover and Saxony, are the districts
  Thedinghausen, Harzburg and Kalvörde, and the three demesnes of
  Bodenburg, Olsburg and Ostharingen. A portion of the Harz mountains was,
  down to 1874, common to Brunswick and Prussia (Hanover) and known as the
  Communion Harz. In 1874 a partition was effected, but the mines are still
  worked in common, four-sevenths of the revenues derived from them falling
  to Prussia and the remaining three-sevenths to Brunswick.</p>

  <p>The northern portion of the duchy has its surface diversified by hill
  and plain; it is mostly arable and has little forest. The other two
  principal portions are intersected by the Harz mountains, and its spurs
  and the higher parts are covered with forests of fir, oak and beech. The
  greatest elevations are the Wurmberg (3230 ft.), and the Achtermannshöhe
  (3100 ft.), lying south of the Brocken. Brunswick belongs almost entirely
  to the basin of the river Weser, into which the Oker, the Aller and the
  Leine, having their sources in the Harz, discharge their waters. The
  climate is mild in the north, but in the hilly country raw and cold in
  winter, and in autumn and spring damp. The area of the duchy is 1424 sq.
  m., and of this total fully one-half is arable land, 10% meadow and
  pasture, and 33% under forest. The population in 1905 was 485,655. The
  religion is, in the main, that of the Lutheran Evangelical church; but
  there is a large Roman Catholic community centred in and round
  Hildesheim, <!-- Page 689 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page689"></a>[v.04 p.0689]</span>the seat of the bishopric of North
  Germany. The Jews have several synagogues, with a rabbinate in Brunswick.
  The birth-rate is 35.3, and the death-rate 21.6 per thousand inhabitants.
  In the rural districts, broad Low German is spoken; but the language of
  the upper and educated classes is distinguished by its purity of style
  and pronunciation.</p>

  <p>The land devoted to agriculture is excellently farmed, and cereals,
  beet (for sugar), potatoes and garden produce of all kinds, particularly
  fruit, obtain the best market prices. The pasture land rears cattle and
  sheep of first-rate quality, and great attention is paid to the breeding
  of horses, in which the famous stud farm at Harzburg has of late years
  been eminently conspicuous. Timber cutting, in the forests of the Harz,
  employs a large number of hands. But agriculture, which, until recently,
  formed the chief wealth of the duchy, has now given way to the mining
  industry, both in point of the numbers of inhabitants employed and in the
  general prosperity distributed by it. The chief seat of the mining
  industry is the Harz, and its development annually increases in extent
  and importance. Coal (bituminous), iron, lead, copper, sulphur, alum,
  marble, alabaster, lime and salt are produced in large quantities, and
  the by-products of some of these, particularly chemicals and asphalt,
  constitute a great source of revenue. The manufactures embrace sugar
  (from beet), spinning, tobacco, paper, soap machines, glass, china, beer
  and sausages. The last are famous throughout Germany. The principal
  articles of export are thread, dyes, cement, chicory, beer, timber,
  preserves, chemicals and sausages. The railways, formerly belonging to
  the state, were, in 1870, leased to private companies and in 1884
  purchased by Prussia, and have a length of about 320 m. The roads, of
  which one quarter are in the hands of the state, are excellently kept,
  and vie with those of any European country.</p>

  <p>The constitution is that of a limited monarchy, and dates from a
  revision of the fundamental law on the 12th of October 1832. The throne
  is hereditary in the house of Brunswick-Lüneburg, according to the law of
  primogeniture, and in the male line of succession, but the rightful heir,
  Ernest, duke of Cumberland, was not allowed to take possession. The
  parliament of the duchy (<i>Landes-</i> or <i>Ständeversammlung</i>) is
  an assembly of estates forming one house of 48 deputies, of whom 30 are
  elected by municipal and rural communities, while the remainder represent
  the Evangelical church, the large landed proprietors, manufacturers and
  the professions. The house, however, has little power in initiating
  legislation, but it can refuse taxation, impeach ministers and receive
  petitions. The executive functions of the administration and government
  reside in the ministry (<i>Staatsministerium</i>) consisting of three
  responsible ministers, assisted by a council of the holders of the other
  chief offices of state. The public debt amounts to about 3¼ millions
  sterling, and the civil list to about £56,000 a year, mostly derived from
  the revenues of the state domains. By virtue of a convention with
  Prussia, of March 1886, the Brunswick contingent to the imperial forces
  forms a part of the Prussian army and is attached to the X. army corps.
  The convention can be rescinded only after a two years' notice.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The lands which comprise the modern duchy of
  Brunswick belonged in the 10th century to the family of the Brunos,
  whence the name Brunswick is derived, of the counts of Nordheim, and the
  counts of Supplinburg. Inherited during the 12th century by Henry the
  Proud, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, and a member of the family of Welf,
  they subsequently formed part of the extensive Saxon duchy ruled by his
  son, Henry the Lion.</p>

  <p>When Henry was placed under the imperial ban and his duchy dismembered
  in 1181, he was allowed to retain his hereditary possessions, which
  consisted of a large part of Brunswick and Lüneburg. The bulk of these
  lands came subsequently to Henry's grandson, Otto, and in 1235 the
  emperor Frederick II., anxious to be reconciled with the Welfs,
  recognized Otto's title and created him duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg.
  Otto added several counties and the town of Hanover to his possessions,
  and when he died in 1252 was succeeded by his sons Albert and John. In
  1267 these princes divided the duchy, Albert becoming duke of Brunswick,
  and John duke of Lüneburg. The dukes of Lüneburg increased the area of
  their duchy, and when the family died out in 1369 a stubborn contest took
  place for its possession. Claimed by Magnus II., duke of
  Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, this prince was forced by the emperor Charles IV.
  to abandon his pretensions, but in 1388 his sons succeeded in
  incorporating Lüneburg with Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. In 1285 the duchy of
  Brunswick had been divided between Duke Albert's three sons, whose
  relations with each other were far from harmonious, and the lines of
  Wolfenbüttel, Göttingen and Grubenhagen had been established. The
  Wolfenbüttel branch died out in 1292, but was refounded in 1345 by Magnus
  I., a younger member of the Göttingen family; the elder Göttingen branch
  died out in 1463, and the Grubenhagen branch in 1596. Magnus I., duke of
  Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel from 1345 to 1369, was the ancestor of the later
  dukes of Brunswick. His grandsons, Frederick, Bernard and Henry, secured
  Lüneburg in 1388, but in 1428 Bernard, the only survivor of the three,
  was forced to make a division of the duchy, by which he received
  Lüneburg, while his nephews, William and Henry, obtained Brunswick, which
  in 1432 they divided into Calenberg and Wolfenbüttel. In 1473, however,
  William, who had added Göttingen to his possessions in 1463, united these
  lands; but they were again divided from 1495 to 1584. In 1584 Brunswick
  was united by Duke Julius, and in 1596 Grubenhagen was added to it. Duke
  Frederick Ulrich, however, was obliged to cede this territory to Lüneburg
  in 1617, and when he died in 1634 his family became extinct, and
  Brunswick was divided between the two branches of the Lüneburg
  family.</p>

  <p>The duchy of Lüneburg, founded by Bernard in 1428, remained undivided
  until 1520, when Duke Henry abdicated and his three sons divided the
  duchy. Two of the branches founded at this time soon died out; and in
  1569, after the death of Ernest I., the representative of the third
  branch, his two sons agreed upon a partition which is of considerable
  importance in the history of Brunswick, since it established the lines of
  Dannenberg and of Lüneburg-Celle, and these two families divided the
  duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1635. The dukes of Lüneburg-Celle
  subsequently took the name of Hanover, and were the ancestors of the
  later kings of Hanover (<i>q.v.</i>). After the acquisition of 1635 the
  family of Dannenberg took the title of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and ruled
  in the direct line until 1735. It was then followed by the family of
  Brunswick-Bevern, which had split off from the parent line in 1666 and
  ruled until 1884.</p>

  <p>Brunswick has not played a very important part in German politics.
  Many counties were added to its area, but it was weakened by constant
  divisions of territory, and during the period of the Reformation some of
  the princes took one side and some the other. The treaty of Westphalia in
  1648 made little difference to its prestige, but its subsequent position
  was greatly affected by the growth of Prussia. During the Seven Years'
  War Brunswick supported Frederick the Great, and in return was severely
  ravaged by the French. Duke Charles I., who accumulated a large amount of
  debt, sought to discharge his liabilities by sending his soldiers as
  mercenaries to assist England during the American War of Independence.
  The succeeding duke, Charles William Ferdinand, brought order into the
  finances, led the Prussian troops against Napoleon, and died in 1806 from
  wounds received at the battle of Auerstadt. Napoleon then declared the
  ducal family deposed and included Brunswick in the kingdom of Westphalia.
  In 1813 it was restored to Duke Frederick William, who was killed in 1815
  at the battle of Quatre Bras. His son, Charles II., while a minor, was
  under the regency of George, afterwards the English king George IV., who
  ruled the duchy through Ernest, Count Münster-Ledenburg (1766-1839),
  assisted by Justus von Schmidt-Phiseldeck (1769-1851). A new constitution
  was granted in 1820, but after Charles came of age in 1823 a period of
  disorder ensued. The duke, who was very unpopular with his subjects,
  quarrelled with his relatives, and in 1830 a revolution drove him from
  the country. The government was undertaken by his brother William, and in
  <!-- Page 690 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page690"></a>[v.04
  p.0690]</span>1831 Charles was declared incapable of ruling, and William
  was appointed as his successor. The ex-duke, who made a fine collection
  of diamonds, died childless at Geneva in August 1873. William's long
  reign witnessed many excellent and necessary reforms. A new constitution
  was granted in 1832, and in 1844 Brunswick joined the Prussian
  Zollverein. Trial by jury and freedom of the press were established, many
  religious disabilities were removed, and measures were taken towards the
  freedom of trade.</p>

  <p>Brunswick took very little part in the war between Prussia and Austria
  in 1866, but her troops fought for Prussia during the Franco-German War
  of 1870-71. The duchy joined the German Confederation in 1815, the North
  German Confederation in 1866, and became a state of the German empire in
  1871.</p>

  <p>In 1866 the question of the succession to Brunswick became acute. Duke
  William was unmarried, and according to the existing conventions it would
  pass to George, king of Hanover, who had just been deprived of his
  kingdom by the king of Prussia. In 1879, however, the duke and the
  estates, with the active support of Prussia, concluded an arrangement for
  a temporary council of regency to take over the government on William's
  death. Moreover, if in this event the rightful heir was unable to take
  possession of the duchy, the council was empowered to appoint a regent.
  William died on the 18th of October 1884, and George's son, Ernest, duke
  of Cumberland, claimed Brunswick and promised to respect the German
  constitution. This claim was disregarded by the council of regency, and
  the Bundesrat declared that the accession of the duke of Cumberland would
  be inimical to the peace and security of the empire on account of his
  attitude towards Prussia. In the following year the council chose Albert,
  prince of Prussia, as regent, a step which brought Brunswick still more
  under the influence of her powerful neighbour. Albert died in September
  1906, and after some futile negotiations with the duke of Cumberland, the
  Brunswick diet chose Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (b. 1857)
  as regent in May 1907.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNSWICK,</b> a city of Germany, capital of the duchy of that
  name, situated in a fertile and undulating country, on the Oker, 37 m.
  S.E. from Hanover and 53 N.W. from Magdeburg, on the main line of railway
  from Berlin. Pop. (1900) 128,226; (1905) 136,423, of which number about
  9000 were Roman Catholics and 1000 Jews. Brunswick is an interesting
  place and retains much of its medieval character. The fortifications
  which formerly environed it were dismantled in 1797, and have given place
  to a regular circle of gardens and promenades, which rank among the
  finest in Germany. Within them lies the old town, with somewhat narrow
  and crooked streets, remarkable for its numerous ancient houses, with
  high gables and quaintly carved exteriors. In picturesqueness it vies
  with Lübeck and Lüneburg among North German towns. Among its churches,
  the cathedral, St Blasius, or Burgkirche, a Romanesque structure begun by
  Henry the Lion about 1173 and finished in 1194, is of interest. The
  chancel is decorated with 12th-century frescoes by Johannes Gallicus, and
  contains the tombs of the founder and his consort, with beautiful
  effigies in relief, and also that of the emperor Otto IV. In the vault
  beneath rest the remains of the Guelphs of the Brunswick line (since
  1681). Remarkable among other churches are the Magnikirche (consecrated
  in 1031; the present edifice being built between the 13th and 15th
  centuries and restored in 1877); the Martinikirche, with Romanesque
  towers, originally a Romanesque basilica (1180-1190), enlarged in the
  13th century in early Gothic by the addition of vaulted aisles and a
  choir (1490-1500), and remarkable further for the splendid late Gothic
  Annenkapelle (1434) and three magnificent portals; the Katharinenkirche,
  with a fine tower, begun by Henry the Lion in 1172, added to in 1252 and
  finished (choir) in 1500; the Brüderkirche (1361-1451, restored
  1869-1870), formerly the church of a Franciscan house, the refectory of
  which (1486) is now used for military stores; the Andreaskirche (1200,
  1360-1420), partly transitional, partly late Gothic, with a tower 318 ft.
  high; and the Aegidienkirche (1278-1434), now used for exhibitions and
  concerts.</p>

  <p>In secular buildings, both ancient and modern, Brunswick is also rich.
  The most noticeable of these is the town hall (14th and 15th centuries),
  a gem of Gothic architecture. In front of it is a beautiful Gothic leaden
  fountain of the early 15th century. Close by the cathedral is the
  Dankwarderode, a two-storeyed Romanesque building, erected in 1884 on the
  site of the ancient citadel of the same name which was destroyed by fire
  in 1873; the cloth merchants' hall (Gewandhaus) of the 13th century, with
  a richly ornamented facade in Renaissance style, now occupied by the
  chamber of commerce; the restored Huneborstelsche Haus with its curious
  and beautiful oak carving of the 16th century. The ducal palace is a fine
  modern structure, erected since 1865, when most of the previous building,
  which dated only from 1831, was destroyed by fire. The famous Quadriga of
  Rietschel, which perished at the same time, has been replaced by a copy
  by Georg Howaldt (1802-1883). The theatre lies on a spacious square close
  to the ducal gardens, and immediately outside the promenades; to the
  south is the handsome railway station. Among other numerous buildings of
  modern erection may be mentioned the new town hall (1895-1900) and the
  ministry of finance, both in early Gothic style. The scientific and art
  collections of Brunswick are numerous. The ducal museum contains a rich
  collection of antique and medieval curiosities, engravings and pictures.
  There are also a municipal museum, a museum of natural history, a
  mineralogical collection, a botanical garden and two libraries. The
  educational and charitable institutions of Brunswick are many. Of the
  former may be mentioned the Collegium Carolinum, founded in 1745, the
  technical high school, two gymnasia and an academy of forestry. Among the
  latter are a deaf and dumb institution, a blind asylum, an orphanage and
  various hospitals and infirmaries. A monument, 60 ft. high, to Duke
  Frederick William, who was slain at Quatre Bras, gives its name to the
  Monumentsplatz. Another to the south-east of the town perpetuates the
  memory of Schill Ferdinand (1776-1809) and his companions. There are also
  statues of Franz Abt, the composer, of Lessing and of the astronomer K.F.
  Gauss.</p>

  <p>The industries of the town are considerable. Especially important are
  the manufacture of machinery, boilers, gasometers, pianos, preserves,
  chemicals, beer and sausages. Brunswick is also a leading centre of the
  book trade. The communications between the inner town and the extensive
  suburbs are maintained by an excellent service of electric tramways.</p>

  <p>Brunswick is said to have been founded about 861 by Bruno, son of Duke
  Ludolf of Saxony, from whom it was named Brunswick (from the Old High
  German <i>Wich</i>, hamlet). Afterwards fortified and improved by Henry
  the Lion, it became one of the most important cities of northern Germany.
  For a long time its constitution was rather peculiar, as it consisted of
  five separate townlets, each with its own walls and gates, its own
  council and Rathaus&mdash;a condition traces of which are still evident.
  In the 13th century it ranked among the first cities of the Hanseatic
  League. After this era, however, it declined in prosperity, in
  consequence of the divisions of territory among the branches of the
  reigning house, the jealousy of the neighbouring states, the Thirty
  Years' War, and more recently the French occupation, under which it was
  assigned to the kingdom of Westphalia. During the time of the Reformation
  the sympathies of the citizens were with the new teaching, and the city
  was a member of the League of Schmalkalden. In 1830 it was the scene of a
  violent revolution, which led to the removal of the reigning duke. In
  1834 it attained municipal self-government.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNSWICK,</b> a village of Cumberland county, Maine, U.S.A., in
  the township of Brunswick, on the Androscoggin river, 9 m. W. of Bath,
  and 27 m. N.N.E. of Portland. Pop. of the township (1900) 6806; (1910)
  6621; of the village (1900) 5210 (1704 foreign-born); (1910) 5341.
  Brunswick is served by the Maine Central railway, and by the Lewiston,
  Brunswick &amp; Bath, and the Portland &amp; Brunswick electric railways.
  Opposite Brunswick and connected with it by a bridge is the township of
  Topsham (pop. in 1910, 2016). The village of Brunswick lies only 63 ft.
  above sea-level, shut within rather narrow bounds by hills or bluffs,
  from which good views may be obtained of the island-dotted sea and
  deeply-indented coast to the south and east and of the White Mountains to
  the west. The river falls in three successive stages for a total distance
  of 41 ft., furnishing good water-power for paper and cotton mills and
  other manufactories; the first cotton-mill in Maine was built here about
  1809. The settlement of the site of Brunswick was begun by fishermen in
  1628 and the place was called Pejepscot; in 1717 Brunswick was
  constituted a township under its present name by the Massachusetts
  general court, and in 1739 the township was regularly incorporated. The
  village was incorporated in 1836.</p>

  <p>Brunswick is best known as the seat of Bowdoin College, a small
  institution of high educational rank. There are eleven buildings on a
  campus of about 40 acres, 1 m. from the riverbank at the end of the
  principal village thoroughfare. The chapel (King Chapel, named in honour
  of William King, the first governor of Maine), built of undressed
  granite, is of Romanesque style, and has twin towers and spires rising to
  a height of 120 ft.; the interior walls are beautifully decorated with
  frescoes and mural paintings. The Walker Art Building (built as a
  memorial to Theophilus W. Walker) is of Italian Renaissance style, has
  mural decorations by John la Farge, Elihu Vedder, Abbott H. Thayer and
  Kenyon Cox, and contains a good collection of paintings and other works
  of art. Among the paintings, many of which were given by the younger
  James Bowdoin, are examples of van Dyck, Titian, Poussin and Rembrandt.
  The library building is of Gothic style, and in 1908 contained 88,000
  volumes (including the private library of the younger James Bowdoin).
  Among the other buildings are an astronomical observatory, a science
  building, a memorial hall, a gymnasium and three dormitories. The
  building of the Medical School of Maine (1820), which is a department of
  the college, is on the same campus. Bowdoin was incorporated by the
  general court of Massachusetts in 1794, but was not opened until 1802. It
  was named in honour of James Bowdoin (1726-1790), whose son was a liberal
  benefactor. The college has been maintained as a non-sectarian
  institution largely by Congregationalists, and is governed by a board of
  trustees and a board of overseers. Among the distinguished alumni have
  been Nathaniel Hawthorne, Franklin Pierce, Henry W. Longfellow, John P.
  Hale, William P. Fessenden, Melville W. Fuller, and Thomas B. Reed.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNSWICK-BEVERN, AUGUST WILHELM,</b> <span class="sc">Duke
  of</span> (1715-1781), Prussian soldier, son of Ernst Ferdinand, duke of
  Brunswick-Bevern, was born at Brunswick in 1715, and entered the Prussian
  army in 1731, becoming colonel of an infantry regiment in 1739. He won
  great distinction at Hohenfriedeberg as a major-general, and was promoted
  lieutenant-general in 1750. He was one of the most experienced and exact
  soldiers in the army of Frederick the Great. He commanded a wing in the
  battle of Lobositz in 1756, and defeated the Austrians under Marshal
  Konigsegg in a well-fought battle at Reichenberg on the 21st of April
  1757. He took part in the battles of Prague and Kolin and the retreat to
  Görlitz, and subsequently commanded the Prussians left behind by
  Frederick in the autumn of 1757 when he marched against the French.
  Bevern conducted a defensive campaign against overwhelming numbers with
  great skill, but he soon lost the valuable assistance of General
  Winterfeld, who was killed in a skirmish at Moys; and he was eventually
  brought to battle and suffered a heavy defeat at Breslau on the 22nd of
  November. He fell into the hands of the Austrians on the following
  morning, and remained prisoner for a year. He was made general of
  infantry in 1759, and on the 11th of August 1762 inflicted a severe
  defeat at Reichenbach on an Austrian army endeavouring to relieve
  Schweidnitz. Bevern retired, after the peace of Hubertusburg, to his
  government of Stettin, where he died in 1781.</p>

  <p><b>BRUNTON, MARY</b> (1778-1818), Scottish novelist, was born on the
  1st of November 1778 in the island of Varra, Orkney. She was the daughter
  of Captain Thomas Balfour of Elwick. At the age of twenty she married
  Alexander Brunton, minister of Bolton in Haddingtonshire, and afterwards
  professor of oriental languages at Edinburgh. Mrs Brunton died on the
  19th of December 1818. She was the author of two novels, popular in their
  day, <i>Self-control</i> (1810), and <i>Discipline</i> (1814; 1832
  edition with memoir); and of a posthumous fragment, <i>Emmeline</i>
  (1819).</p>

  <p><b>BRUSA,</b> or <span class="sc">Broussa</span> (anc. <i>Prusa</i>),
  the capital of the Brusa (Khudavendikiar) vilayet of Asia Minor, which
  includes parts of ancient Mysia, Bithynia, and Phrygia, and extends in a
  southeasterly direction from Mudania, on the Sea of Marmora, to
  Afium-Kara-Hissar on the Smyrna-Konia railway. The vilayet is one of the
  most important in Asiatic Turkey, has great mineral and agricultural
  wealth, many mineral springs, large forests, and valuable industries. It
  exports cereals, silk, cotton, opium, tobacco, olive-oil, meerschaum,
  boracite, &amp;c. The Ismid-Angora and Eskishehr-Konia railways pass
  through the province. Population of the province, 1,600,000 (Moslems,
  1,280,000; Christians, 317,000; Jews, 3000).</p>

  <p>The city stretches along the lower slopes of the Mysian Olympus or
  Kechish Dagh, occupying a position above the valley of the Nilufer
  (<i>Odrysses</i>) not unlike that of Great Malvern above the vale of the
  Severn. It is divided by ravines into three quarters, and in the centre,
  on a bold terrace of rock, stood the ancient <i>Prusa</i>. The modern
  town has clean streets and good roads made by Ahmed Vefyk Pasha when
  Vali, and it contains mosques and tombs of great historic and
  architectural interest; the more important are those of the sultans Murad
  I., Bayezid (Bajazet) I., Mahommed I., and Murad II., 1403-1451, and the
  Ulu Jami'. The mosques show traces of Byzantine, Persian and Arab
  influence in their plan, architecture and decorative details. The
  circular church of St Elias, in which the first two sultans, Osman and
  Orkhan, were buried, was destroyed by fire and earthquake, and rebuilt by
  Ahmed Vefyk Pasha. There are in the town an American mission and school,
  and a British orphanage. Silk-spinning is an important industry, the
  export of silk in 1902 being valued at £620,000. There are also
  manufactories of silk stuffs, towels, burnús, carpets, felt
  prayer-carpets embroidered in silk and gold. The hot iron and sulphur
  springs near Brusa, varying in temperature from 112° to 178° F., are
  still much used. The town is connected with its port, Mudania, by a
  railway and a road. There is a British vice-consul. Pop. 75,000 (Moslems,
  40,000; Christians, 33,000; Jews, 2000).</p>

  <p><i>Prusa</i>, founded, it is said, at the suggestion of Hannibal, was
  for a long time the seat of the Bithynian kings. It continued to flourish
  under the Roman and Byzantine emperors till the 10th century, when it was
  captured and destroyed by Saif-addaula of Aleppo. Restored by the
  Byzantines, it was again taken in 1327 by the Ottomans after a siege of
  ten years, and continued to be their capital till Murad I. removed to
  Adrianople. In 1402 it was pillaged by the Tatars; in 1413 it resisted an
  attack of the Karamanians; in 1512 it fell into the power of Ala ed-Din;
  and in 1607 it was burnt by the rebellious Kalenderogli. In 1883 it was
  occupied by the Egyptians under Ibrahim Pasha, and from 1852-1855
  afforded an asylum to Abd-el-Kader.</p>

  <p><b>BRUSH, GEORGE DE FOREST</b> (1855- ), American painter, was born at
  Shelbyville, Tennessee, on the 28th of September 1855. He was a pupil of
  J.L. Gérôme at Paris, and became a member of the National Academy of
  Design, New York. From 1883 onwards, he attracted much attention by his
  paintings of North American Indians, his "Moose Hunt," "Aztec King" and
  "Mourning her Brave" achieving great popularity and showing the strong
  influence of Gérôme. These <!-- Page 692 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page692"></a>[v.04 p.0692]</span>were followed by picture
  portraits, particularly of mother and child, largely suggestive of the
  work of the Dutch, Flemish and German masters, carefully arranged as to
  line and mass, and worked out in great detail with consummate technical
  skill. Several of his paintings have for subject his own children and his
  wife; one of these is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.</p>

  <p><b>BRUSH</b> (from Fr. <i>brosse</i>, which, like the English word,
  means both the undergrowth of a wood and the instrument; if the word in
  both these meanings is ultimately the same, then the origin is from a
  bundle of brushwood used as a brush or broom, but this is historically
  doubtful, and others connect it with the Ger. <i>Borste</i>, bristle), an
  instrument for removing dust or dirt from surfaces or for applying paint,
  whitewash, &amp;c., composed of a tuft or tufts of some fibrous or
  flexible material secured to a solid basis or stock. Brushes made of the
  twigs of trees like the birch and provided with long handles are often
  called brooms, and the same term is applied to some brushes used in the
  household for removing dust (<i>e.g.</i> carpet-broom, whisk-broom) but
  not to those used for applying paint. Among the numerous materials
  employed for the manufacture of brushes of various kinds are feathers,
  pig's bristles, the hair of certain animals, whalebone, rubber,
  split-cane, broom-corn (a variety of sorghum) and coir.</p>

  <p>Brushes are of two kinds, simple and compound. The former consist of
  but one tuft, as hair pencils and painters' tools. The latter have more
  than one tuft. Brushes with the tufts placed side by side on flat boards,
  as plasterers' brushes, are called stock-brushes. The single tuft
  brushes, or pencils for artists, are made of the hair of the camel,
  badger, goat and other animals for the smaller kind, and pig's bristles
  for the larger. The hairs for pencils are carefully arranged so as to
  form a point in the centre, and, when tied together, are passed into the
  wide end of the quill or metal tube and drawn out at the other end to the
  extent required. The small ends of the quills, having been previously
  moistened, contract as they dry and bind the hair. A similar effect is
  produced with metal tubes by compression. Compound brushes
  are&mdash;first, set or pan-work; second, drawn-work. Of the former, an
  example is the common house-broom, into the stock of which holes are
  drilled of the size wanted. The necessary quantity of bristles, hair, or
  fibre to fill each hole being collected together, the thick ends are
  dipped into molten cement chiefly composed of pitch, bound round with
  thread, dipped again, and then set into a hole of the stock with a
  peculiar twisting motion. In drawn-brushes, of which those for shoes,
  teeth, nails and clothes are examples, the holes are more neatly bored,
  and have smaller ones at the top communicating with the back of the
  brush, through which a bight or loop of wire passes from the back of the
  stock. Half the number of hairs of fibres needed for the tufts to fill
  the holes are passed into the bight of the wire, which is then pulled
  smartly so as to double the hairs and force them into the loop-hole as
  far as possible. With all brushes, when the holes have been properly
  filled, the ends of the fibres outside are cut with shears, either to an
  even length or such form as may be desired. The backs are then covered
  with veneer or other material to conceal the wire and other crudities of
  the work. In trepanned brushes the bristles are inserted in holes that do
  not pass right through the stock, and are secured by threads or wires
  running in drawholes which are drilled through the stock at right angles
  to them. The ends of these drawholes are plugged so as to be as
  inconspicuous as possible, and the method avoids the necessity of a
  veneer on the back. The Woodbury machine, one of the earliest mechanical
  devices for the manufacture of brushes, which was invented in America
  about 1870, produced brushes of this kind. One of the most important
  purposes to which brushes have been applied is that of sweeping chimneys,
  and so far back as 1789 John Elin patented an arrangement of brushes for
  this purpose. Revolving brushes for sweeping rooms were patented in 1811,
  and the first patent in which they were applied to hair-dressing appears
  in 1862. Many inventions for sweeping and cleaning roads by means of
  revolving brushes and other contrivances have been introduced, one of the
  first being that of Edmund Henning in 1699 for "a new engine for sweeping
  the streets of London, or any city or town."</p>

  <p>Brushes with tufts formed of steel wire are used for cleaning tubes
  and flues of steam boilers, for the purpose of removing the scale formed
  by the products of combustion. Steel-wire brushes are also used for
  cleaning scale from the interior surfaces of a boiler, and for removing
  the sand from the surface of a casting. Occasionally such brushes are
  revolved in a machine, for more convenient use on the article to be
  cleaned or polished. Snyer's patent elastic clutch or coupling, used for
  such purposes as coupling up or disconnecting a steam-engine from a line
  of shafting or dynamo, consists essentially of two disks, the adjacent
  faces of which are provided, one with a ring of brushes made of flat
  steel wire, the other with a number of finely serrated teeth. One of the
  disks is movable longitudinally on its shaft, and with the brushes clear
  of the serrations the clutch is free. On bringing the disks together,
  which may be done with the engine running at speed, the elasticity of the
  brush permits the motion to be imparted gradually and without shock to
  the standing part, until both rotate and are locked together. These
  clutches are very powerful, and are capable of transmitting as much as
  3000 horse-power.</p>

  <p>In dynamo-electric machinery the device used to conduct current into
  or out of the rotating armature is termed a "brush." There are usually
  two brushes to each dynamo or motor, and they are placed diametrically
  opposite, lightly touching the commutator of the armature. It is
  important that there should be good metallic contact between the brushes
  and the commutator, and at the same time the frictional resistance
  resulting from the contact must be a minimum. To effect this result
  brushes are variously made. A kind of brush frequently used consists of a
  number of copper wires laid side by side and soldered together at one
  end, where the brush is held. Brushes are also made of strips of spongy
  copper cut like a comb, which give a number of bearing points on the
  commutator. Very good results are obtained from brushes made of copper
  gauze wound closely until it takes the exterior form of a rectangular
  block, which is held radially in a spring holder, and bears at the end on
  the commutator. In place of the gauze block "brushes" of hard carbon
  blocks are frequently used (see <span class="sc">Dynamo</span>).</p>

  <p><b>BRUSSELS</b> (Fr. <i>Bruxelles</i>, Flem. <i>Brussel</i>), the
  capital of the kingdom of Belgium, and of the province of Brabant,
  situated in 50° 51&prime; N., 4° 22&prime; E., about 70 m. from the sea
  at Ostend. It occupies the plain or valley of the Senne, and the sides
  and crest of the hill lying to the east and south-east of that valley. It
  is now extending over the hills west of the valley, and to the north is
  the town or commune of Laeken, which is practically part of the city.
  Brussels suffered severely in 1695 from the bombardment of the French
  under Villeroi, who fired into the town with red-hot shot. Sixteen
  churches and 4000 houses were burnt down, and the historic buildings on
  the Grand Place were seriously injured, the houses of the Nine Nations on
  the eastern side being completely destroyed. In 1731 the famous palace of
  the Netherlands was destroyed by fire, and the only remains of this
  edifice are some ruined arches and walls in a remote comer of the grounds
  of the king's palace. The Porte de Hal is the only one of the eight gates
  in the old wall left standing. It dates from 1381, and is well worth more
  careful examination than it receives. In the latter half of the 18th
  century it served as a kind of bastille for political prisoners, and is
  now used as a museum in which a rather nondescript collection of
  articles, some from Mexico, has been allowed to accumulate. With regard
  to the fine boulevards of the Upper Town, it may be mentioned that about
  1765 they were planted with the double row of lime trees which still
  constitute their chief ornament by Prince Charles of Lorraine while
  governing the Netherlands for his sister-in-law, the empress Maria
  Theresa. The residence of this prince was the palace of William the
  Silent, before he declared against Spam, and it is now used partly for
  the royal library, which contains the famous <i>librairie de
  Bourgogne</i>, and partly for the museum <!-- Page 693 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page693"></a>[v.04 p.0693]</span>of modern
  pictures. The only other "hotel" or palace in Brussels is that of the
  duke d'Arenberg. In the 16th century this was the residence of Count
  Egmont, but very little of the building of his day remains. In the same
  street, the rue des Petits Carmes, was the Hôtel Culembourg in which the
  famous oath of the beggars was taken. It has long been demolished and the
  new barracks of the Grenadier regiment have been erected on the site.</p>

  <p>The only other buildings of importance dating from medieval times are
  the three churches of Ste Gudule (often erroneously called the
  cathedral), Notre-Dame des Victoires or Church of the Sablon, and
  Notre-Dame de la Chapelle, or simply la Chapelle, and the hotel de ville
  and the Maison du Roi on the Grand Place. The church of Ste Gudule, also
  dedicated to St Michael, is built on the side of the hill originally
  called St Michael's Mount, and now covered by the fashionable quarters
  which are included under the comprehensive description, of the Upper
  Town. It was begun about the year 1220, and is considered one of the
  finest specimens left of pointed Gothic. It is said to have been
  completed in 1273, with the exception of the two towers which were added
  in the 14th or 15th century. Some of the stained glass is very rich,
  dating from the 13th to the 15th century. In many of the windows there
  are figures of leading members of the houses of Burgundy and Habsburg.
  The curious oak pulpit representing Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden
  of Eden came originally from the Jesuit church at Louvain, and is
  considered the masterpiece of Verbruggen. The church of the Sablon is
  said to have been founded in 1304 by the gild of Crossbowmen to celebrate
  the battle of Woeringen. In a side chapel is a fine monument to the
  princely family of Thurn and Taxis, which had the monopoly of the postal
  service in the old empire. La Chapelle is still older, dating nominally
  from 1210, the choir and transept being considered to date from about
  fifty years later. There are some fine monuments, especially one to the
  duke de Croy who died in 1624. The two churches last named have undergone
  much renovation both outside and inside.</p>

  <p>The Grand Place is by its associations one of the most interesting
  public squares in Europe. On its flags were fought out many feuds between
  rival gilds; Egmont and Horn, and many other gallant men whose names have
  been forgotten, were executed here under the shadow of its ancient
  buildings, and in more recent times Dumouriez proclaimed the French
  Republic where the dukes of Brabant and Burgundy were wont to hold their
  jousts. Apart from its associations the Grand Place contains two of the
  finest and most ornate buildings not merely in the capital but in
  Belgium. Of these the hôtel de ville, which is far the larger of the two,
  occupies the greater part of the south side of the square. Its facade has
  the disadvantage of having had one half begun about half a century before
  the other. The older, which is the richer in design, forms the left side
  of the building and dates from 1410, while the right, less rich and
  shorter, was begun in 1443. The fine tower, 360 ft. in height, is crowned
  by the golden copper figure of St Michael, 16 ft. in height, erected here
  as early as 1454. This tower lies behind the extremity of the left wing
  of the building. Opposite the town-hall is the smaller but extremely
  ornate Maison du Roi. This was never a royal residence as the name would
  seem to imply, but its description appears to have been derived from the
  fact that it was usually in this building that the royal address was read
  to the states-general. As this building was almost destroyed by
  Villeroi's bombardment it possesses no claim to antiquity, indeed the
  existing building was only completed in 1877. Egmont and Horn were
  sentenced in the hôtel de ville, and passed their last night in the
  Maison du Roi.</p>

  <p>Among the principal buildings erected in the city during the 18th
  century are the king's palace and the house of parliament or Palais de la
  Nation, which face the south and north sides of the park respectively.
  The palace occupies part of the site covered by the old palace burnt down
  in 1731, and it was built in the reign of the empress Maria Theresa. It
  originally consisted of two detached buildings, but in 1826-1827 King
  William I. of the Netherlands caused them to be connected. The palace
  contains two fine rooms used for court ceremonies, and a considerable
  number of pictures. In 1904 a bill was passed in the chambers for the
  enlargement and embellishment of the palace. The adjacent buildings, viz.
  the department of the civil list, formerly the residence of the marquis
  d'Assche, and the Hôtel de Bellevue, held under a kind of perpetual lease
  granted by the empress Maria Theresa, were absorbed in the palace, and a
  new façade was constructed which occupies the entire length of the Place
  du Palais. At the same time a piece was cut off the park to prevent the
  undue contraction of the Place by the necessary bringing forward of the
  palace, and the pits which played a certain part in the revolution of
  1830 when the Dutch defended the park for a few days against the Belgians
  were filled up. The Palais de la Nation was constructed between 1779 and
  1783, also during the Austrian period. It was intended for the
  states-general and government offices. During the French occupation the
  law courts sat there, and from 1817 to 1830 it was assigned for the
  sittings of the states-general. It is now divided between the senate and
  the chamber of representatives. In 1833 the part assigned to the latter
  was burnt out, and has since been reconstructed. The buildings flanking
  the chambers and nearer the park are government offices with residences
  for the ministers attached.</p>

  <p>The improvements effected in Brussels during the 19th century were
  enormous, and completely transformed the city. The removal of the old
  wall was followed by the creation of the quartier Léopold, and at a later
  period of the quartier Louis in the Upper Town. In the lower, under the
  energetic direction of two burgomasters, De Brouckere and Anspach, not
  less sweeping changes were effected. The Senne was bricked in, and the
  fine boulevards du Nord, Anspach, Hainaut and Midi took the place of
  slums. The Bourse and the post-office are two fine modern buildings in
  this quarter of the city. The Column of the Congress&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of
  the Belgian representatives who founded the kingdom of
  Belgium&mdash;surmounted by a statue of King Leopold I., was erected in
  1859, and in 1866 the foundation-stone was laid of the Palais de Justice,
  which was not finished till 1883, at a cost of sixty million francs. This
  edifice, the design of the architect Poelaert, is in the style of Karnak
  and Nineveh, but surmounted with a dome, and impresses by its grandiose
  proportions (see <span class="sc">Architecture</span>, Plate XI. fig.
  121). It is well placed on the brow of the hill at the southern extremity
  of the rue de la Régence (the prolongation of the rue Royale), and can be
  seen from great distances. In the rue de la Régence are the new picture
  gallery, a fine building with an exceedingly good collection of pictures,
  the palace of the count of Flanders, and the garden of the Petit Sablon,
  which contains statues of Egmont and Horn, and a large number of
  statuettes representing the various gilds and handicrafts. Immediately
  above this garden is the Palais d'Arenberg. Perhaps the memorial that
  attracts the greatest amount of public interest in Brussels is that to
  the Belgians who were killed during the fighting with the Dutch in
  September 1830. This has been erected in a little square called the Place
  des Martyrs, not far from the Monnaie theatre. Outside Brussels at Evere
  is the chief cemetery, with fine monuments to the British officers killed
  at Waterloo (removed from the church in that village), to the French
  soldiers who died on Belgian soil in 1870-71, and another to the
  Prussians.</p>

  <p>Many as were the changes in Brussels during the 19th century, those in
  progress at its close and at the beginning of the 20th have effected a
  marked alteration in the town. These have been rendered possible only by
  the excellent system of electric tramways which have brought districts
  formerly classed as pure country within reach of the citizens. The
  construction of the fine Avenue de Louise (1½ m. long) from the Boulevard
  de Waterloo to the Bois de la Cambre was the first of these efforts to
  bring the remote suburbs within easy reach, at the same time furnishing
  an approach to the "bois" of Brussels that might in some degree be
  compared with the Champs Élysées in Paris. Another avenue of later
  construction (6½ m. in length) connects the park of the Cinquantenaire
  with Tervueren. This route is extremely <!-- Page 694 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page694"></a>[v.04 p.0694]</span>picturesque,
  traverses part of the forest of Soignies, and is lined by many
  fashionable villas and country houses. Other improvements projected in
  1908 on the slope of the hill immediately below the Place Royale included
  the removal of the old tortuous and steep street called the "Montagne de
  la Cour" to give place to a Mont des Arts. A little lower down and not
  far from the university (which occupies the house of the famous cardinal
  Granvelle of the 16th century) a central railway terminus was designed on
  a vast scale. These improvements connote the obliteration of the
  insanitary and overcrowded courts and alleys which were to be found
  between all the main streets, few in number, connecting the upper and the
  lower towns. The ridge on the west and north-west of the Senne valley
  never formed part of the town, and it was from it that Villeroi bombarded
  the city. The suburbs on this ridge, from south to north, are Anderlecht,
  Molenbeek and Koekelberg, and Laeken with its royal château and park
  forms the northern part of the Brussels conglomeration. Brussels has been
  growing at such a rapid rate that the inclusion of this ridge, and more
  particularly at Koekelberg, within the town limits, was contemplated in
  1908.</p>

  <p>The completion of the harbour works, making Brussels a seaport by
  giving sea-going vessels access thereto, was taken in hand in 1897. The
  completed work provides for a waterway for steamers drawing 24 ft. by the
  Willibroek Canal into the Ruppel and the Scheldt. There are steamers
  plying direct from Brussels to London, and 372 vessels of a total tonnage
  of 76,000 entered and left the port in 1905. The Willibroek Canal was
  made in the 16th century, and William I. of the Netherlands is entitled
  to the credit of having first thought of converting it into a ship canal
  from Brussels to the Scheldt. Nothing was done, however, in his time to
  carry out the scheme. The distance from Brussels to the Ruppel is only 20
  m., and thus Brussels is only about 33 m. farther from the sea than
  Antwerp.</p>

  <p>In addition to the advantages it enjoys from being the seat of the
  court and the government, Brussels is the centre of many prosperous
  industries. The manufactures of lace, carpets and curtains, furniture and
  carriages may be particularly mentioned, but it is chiefly as a place of
  residence for the well-to-do that the city has increased in size and
  population. Schools of all kinds are abundant. At the École Militaire
  youths are trained nominally for the army, but many go there who intend
  to enter one of the professions or the public service. This school used
  to occupy part of the old abbey of the Cambre, situated in a hollow near
  the bois and the avenue Louise, but owing to its insanitary position it
  has been removed to a new building near the Cinquantenaire. There is a
  university, to which admission is easy and where the fees are moderate,
  and the Conservatoire provides as good musical teaching as can be found
  in Europe. Music can be enjoyed every day in the year either out of doors
  or under cover. During the winter and spring the opera continues without
  a break at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, which may be called the national
  theatre. Concerts are held frequently, as the Belgians are a musical
  people. Of late years sport has taken a prominent part in Belgian life.
  There are athletic institutions, and football is quite a popular game.
  Horse-racing has also come into vogue, and Boitsfort, in the bois, and
  Groenendael, farther off in the Forêt de Soignies, are fashionable places
  of reunion for society.</p>

  <p>The town of Brussels has a separate administration, which is directed
  by a burgomaster and sheriffs at the head of a town council, whose
  headquarters are in the hôtel de ville. In the Brussels agglomeration are
  nine suburbs or communes, each self-governing with burgomaster and
  sheriffs located in a Maison Communale. These suburbs (beginning on the
  north and following the circumference eastward) are Schaerbeek, St
  Josse-ten-Noode, Etterbeek, Ixelles, St Gilles, Cureghem, Anderlecht,
  Molenbeek and Koekelberg. Laeken, which is really a tenth suburb, is
  classified as a town. In 1856 the population of Brussels alone was
  152,828, and by 1880 it had only increased to 162,498. In 1890 the
  figures were 176,138; in 1900, 183,686; and in December 1904, 194,196.
  The great increase has been in the suburbs, amounting to nearly 80% in
  twenty-five years. In 1880 the population of the ten suburbs including
  Laeken was 248,079. In 1904 the total was 436,453, thus giving for the
  whole of Brussels a grand total of 630,649.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The name Brussel seems to have been derived from
  Broeksele, the village on the marsh or brook, and probably it was the
  most used point for crossing the Senne on the main Roman and Frank road
  between Tournai and Cologne. The Senne, a small tributary of the Scheldt,
  flows through the lower town, but since 1868 it has been covered in, and
  some of the finest boulevards in the lower town have been constructed
  over the course of the little river. The name Broeksele is mentioned by
  the chroniclers in the 8th century, and in the 10th the church of Ste
  Gudule is said to have been endowed by the emperor Otto I. In the next
  two centuries Brussels grew in size and importance, and its trade gilds
  were formed on lines similar to those of Ghent. In 1312 Duke John II. of
  Brabant granted the citizens their charter, distinguished from others as
  that of Cortenberg. In 1356 Duke Wenceslas confirmed this charter and
  also the Golden Bull of the emperor Charles IV. of 1349 by his famous
  "Joyous Entry" into Louvain, the capital of the duchy. These three deeds
  or enactments constituted the early constitution of the South
  Netherlands, which, with one important modification in the time of
  Charles V., remained intact till the Brabant revolution in the reign of
  Joseph II. In 1357 Wenceslas ordered a new wall embracing a greater area
  than the earlier one to be constructed round Brussels, and this was
  practically intact until after the Belgian revolution in 1830-1831. It
  took twelve, or, according to others, twenty-two years to build. In 1383
  the dukes of Brabant transferred their capital from Louvain to Brussels,
  although for some time they did not trust themselves out of the strong
  castle which they had erected at Vilvorde, half-way between the two
  turbulent cities. During this period the population of Brussels is
  supposed to have been 50,000, or one-fifth of that of Ghent. In 1420 the
  gilds of Brussels obtained a further charter recognizing their status as
  the Nine Nations, a division still existing. Having fixed their seat of
  government at Brussels the dukes of Brabant proceeded to build a castle
  and place of residence on the Caudenberg hill, which is practically the
  site of the Place Royale and the king's palace to-day. This ducal
  residence, enlarged and embellished by its subsequent occupants, became
  eventually the famous palace of the Netherlands which witnessed the
  abdication of Charles V. in 1555, and was destroyed by fire in 1731. In
  1430 died Philip, last duke of Brabant as a separate ruler, and the duchy
  was merged in the possessions of the duke of Burgundy.</p>

  <p>In the 17th century Brussels was described (Comte de Ségur, quoting
  the memoirs of M. de la Serre) as "one of the finest, largest and
  best-situated cities not only of Brabant but of the whole of Europe. The
  old quarters which preserve in our time an aspect so singularly
  picturesque with their sloping and tortuous streets, the fine hotels of
  darkened stone sculptured in the Spanish fashion, and the magnificence of
  the Place of the hôtel de ville were buried behind an enceinte of walls
  pierced by eight lofty gates flanked with one hundred and twenty-seven
  round towers at almost equal distance from each other like the balls of a
  crown. At a distance of less than a mile was the forest of Soignies with
  great numbers of stags, red and roe deer, that were hunted on horseback
  even under the ramparts of the town. On the promenade of the court there
  circulated in a long file ceaselessly during fashionable hours five or
  six hundred carriages, the servants in showy liveries. In the numerous
  churches the music was renowned, the archduke Leopold being passionately
  given to the art, maintaining at his own cost forty or fifty musicians,
  the best of Italy and Germany. Under the windows of the palace stretched
  the same park that we admire to-day, open all the year to privileged
  persons and twice a year to the public, a park filled with trees of rare
  essences and the most delicious flowers so artistically disposed, and so
  refreshing to the eyes, that M. de la Serre declared that if he had seen
  there an apple tree he would assuredly have taken it for an earthly
  Paradise."</p>

  <p><b>BRUTÉ, SIMON WILLIAM GABRIEL</b> (1779-1839), American prelate,
  first Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese of Vincennes, Indiana, U.S.A.,
  was born at Rennes, France, on the 20th of March 1779, his father, Simon
  Gabriel Guillaume Bruté de Remur (1729-1786), being superintendent of the
  crown lands in Brittany. He was educated for the medical profession, but
  entered the Sulpician Seminary of Paris in November 1803, was ordained
  priest in 1808, refused the post of chaplain to Napoleon, was professor
  of theology in the Diocesan Seminary at Rennes in 1808-1810, and in
  August 1810 settled in Baltimore, Maryland, whither his long general
  interest in missions, and particularly his acquaintance with Bishop
  Flaget of Kentucky, had drawn him. After teaching for two years
  (1810-1812) in Baltimore, he was sent to Mount St Mary's College,
  Emmitsburg, Maryland, where he remained until 1815, acting both as
  teacher and as pastor. He next visited France in the interest of American
  missions, and on his return in November 1815, became president of St
  Mary's College, Baltimore. In 1818 he resumed his labours at Emmitsburg,
  and from this time until 1834 he held an almost unparalleled place in the
  American church, being constantly consulted by clergy throughout the
  country, besides lecturing, teaching, preaching and caring for his
  parish. The see of Vincennes was created in 1834; and Bruté, nominated
  its first bishop and consecrated in the same year, went to France for
  financial aid, with which he built his cathedral and several useful
  institutions. Here, too, he was professor of theology in his seminary,
  teacher in one of his academies, as well as pastor and bishop.
  Interesting stories are told of the high respect in which he was held by
  the neighbouring Indians, who called him "chief of the Black robes" and
  "man of the true prayer." He died in Vincennes, Indiana, on the 26th of
  June 1839. His great influence on the entire church, his wonderful
  success in planning, financing, and carrying out necessary ecclesiastical
  reforms, and the constructive and executive ability he displayed in his
  diocese, make him one of the foremost Catholic emigrants to the United
  States. He wrote <i>Brief Notes</i> on his experiences in France in 1793,
  in which he describes state persecution of Catholic priests.</p>

  <p><b>BRUTTII,</b> an ancient tribe of lower Italy. This tribe, called
  Bruttii and Brittii in Latin inscriptions, and <span title="Brettioi" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&rho;&#x1F73;&tau;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&iota;</span> on Greek coins
  and by Greek authors, occupied the south-western peninsula of Italy in
  historical times, the <i>ager Bruttius</i> (wrongly called
  <i>Bruttium</i>) corresponding almost exactly to the modern Calabria. It
  was separated from Lucania on the north by a line drawn from the mouth of
  the river L&#x101;us on the west to a point a little south of the river
  Crathis on the east. To part or the whole of this peninsula the name
  <i>Italia</i> was first applied. In alliance with the Lucanians the
  Bruttii made war on the Greek colonies of the coast and seized on Vibo in
  356 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and, though for a time overcome by
  the Greeks who were aided by Alexander of Epirus and Agathocles of
  Syracuse, they reasserted their mastery of the town from about the
  beginning of the 3rd century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and held it
  until it became a Latin colony at the end of the same century (see
  <i>Corp. Inscr. Lat.</i> x. p. 7, and the references there given). At
  this time they were speaking Oscan as well as Greek, and two of three
  Oscan inscriptions in Greek alphabet still testify to the language spoken
  in the town in the 3rd century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> We know,
  however, that the Bruttians, though at this date speaking the same
  language (Oscan) as the Samnite tribe of the Lucani, were not actually
  akin to them. The name <i>Bruttii</i> was used by the Lucanians to mean
  "runaway slaves," but it is considerably more likely that this
  signification was attached to the tribal name of the Bruttii from the
  historical fact that they had been conquered and expelled by the Samnite
  invaders (cf. the use of <span title="Skuthai" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&kappa;&#x1F7B;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span> to mean "policemen" at
  Athens, and still more closely the German, French and English word
  "slave" derived from "Slav"), than that the tribe when living in
  territory it could call its own should have adopted an opprobrious name
  taken from the language of hostile neighbours (see Strabo vi. I, 4; Diod.
  Sic. xvi. 15). Mommsen pointed out (<i>Unterital. Dialekte</i>, p. 97)
  the evidence of tradition (especially Aristotle, <i>Pol</i>. 4 [7] 10)
  showing that the customs of the Bruttii had a certain affinity with those
  of the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Greece, and it has been argued
  (Ridgeway <i>apud</i> Conway, <i>Ital. Dialects</i>, p. 16) that a
  tradition (preserved in Stephanus of Byzantium, <i>s.v.</i> <span
  title="Chioi" class="grk">&Chi;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&iota;</span>) made it
  probable that they were called <span title="Pelasgoi" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&#x1F73;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&gamma;&omicron;&iota;</span>. This
  evidence points to the conjecture that they were part of what is now
  generally called the Mediterranean race (see, <i>e.g.</i> G. Sergi,
  <i>The Mediterranean Race</i>, Eng. trans., 1901; W.Z. Ripley, <i>Races
  of Europe</i>, p. 128). Many Indo-European elements appear in their
  place-names (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Sila</i>=Latin <i>silva</i>, Greek <span
  title="hulê" class="grk">&#x1F55;&lambda;&eta;</span>; <i>Temesa</i>, cf.
  Gr. <span title="temenos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> or Sanskrit
  <i>tamas</i>, darkness, shadow), and none that suggest a
  non-Indo-European origin. <i>A priori</i> considerations suggest that
  they may have been akin to the Siceli, but of this at present no positive
  evidence can be given.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the Bruttii were at the height of their power during
  the 3rd century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Their chief towns were
  Consentia (Cosenza), Petelia (near Strongoli), and Clampetia (Amantea).
  To this period (about the time of the Roman War against Pyrrhus) is to be
  assigned the series of their coins, and they appear to have retained the
  right of coinage even after their final subjugation by the Romans (see
  B.V. Head, <i>Historia Numorum</i>, p. 77). The influence of Hellenism
  over them is shown by finds in the tombs and the fact that they spoke the
  Greek language as well as their own (<i>bilingues</i> in Ennius). The
  mountainous country, ill-suited for agricultural purposes, was well
  adapted for these hardy warriors, whose training was Spartan in its
  simplicity and severity.</p>

  <p>The Bruttii first came into collision with the Romans during the war
  with Pyrrhus, to whom they sent auxiliaries; after his defeat, they
  submitted, and were deprived of half their territory in the Sila forest,
  which was declared state property. In the war with Hannibal, they were
  among the first to declare in his favour after the battle of Cannae, and
  it was in their country that Hannibal held his ground during the last
  stage of the war (at Castrum Hannibalis on the gulf of Scylacium).</p>

  <p>(R. S. C.)</p>

  <p>The Bruttii entirely lost their freedom at the end of the Hannibalic
  war; in 194 colonies of Roman citizens were founded at Tempsa and Croton,
  and a colony with Latin rights at Hipponium called henceforward Vibo
  Valentia. In 132 the consul P. Popillius built the great inland road from
  Capua through Vibo and Consentia to Rhegium, while the date of the
  construction of the east and west coast roads is uncertain. Neither in
  the Social War, nor in the rising of Spartacus, who held out a long time
  in the Sila (71 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), do the Bruttii play a
  part as a people. Vibo was the naval base of Octavian in the conflict
  with Sextus Pompeius (42-36 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>).</p>

  <p>The most important product of the district was the wood from the
  forests of the Sila, and the pitch produced from it. The Sila also
  contained minerals, which were worked out in very early times. The coast
  plains were in parts very fertile, especially the (now malarious) lower
  valley of the Crathis. Under the empire, however, the whole district
  remained backward and was remarkable for the absence of important towns,
  as the scarcity of ancient inscriptions, both Greek and Latin, shows: the
  Sila was state domain, and most of the rest in the hands of large
  proprietors. Augustus joined it with Lucania (from which it was divided
  by the rivers Laus and Crathis) to form the third region of Italy. In the
  2nd and 3rd centuries, for administrative and juridical purposes, it was
  sometimes (with Lucania) joined to Apulia and Calabria. Diocletian placed
  Lucania and Brittii (as the name was then spelt) under a
  <i>corrector</i>, whose residence was at Rhegium. The boundaries of the
  original third Augustan region had by that time become somewhat altered,
  Metapontum belonging to Calabria, and Salernum and the territory of the
  Picentini to the third region instead of the first (Campania). From the
  6th century, after the fall of <!-- Page 696 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page696"></a>[v.04 p.0696]</span>the Ostrogothic power, and the
  establishment of that of Byzantium in its place in south Italy, the name
  Calabria was applied to the whole of the south Italian possessions of the
  Eastern empire, and the name of the Brittii entirely disappeared; and
  after the eastern peninsula (the ancient Calabria) had been taken by the
  Lombards about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 668, the western retained
  the name, and has kept it till the present day.</p>

  <p><b>BRUTUS</b> (originally an adjective meaning "heavy," "stupid,"
  kindred with Gr. <span title="barus" class="grk"
  >&beta;&alpha;&rho;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;</span>, cf. Eng. "brute," "brutal"),
  the surname of several distinguished Romans belonging to the Junian
  gens.</p>

  <p>I. <span class="sc">Lucius Junius Brutus</span>, one of the first two
  consuls, 509 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> According to the legends, his
  mother was the sister of Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the Roman
  kings, and his father and his elder brother had been put to death by the
  reigning family in order to get possession of his wealth. Junius, the
  younger, owed his safety to his reputed dullness of intellect (whence his
  surname), which character, however, he had only assumed for prudential
  reasons (Dion. Halic. iv. 67, 77). The story is probably an invention to
  account for his name; in any case his dullness did not prevent his
  appointment as master of the horse. When Lucretia, wife of Collatinus,
  was outraged by Sextus Tarquinius (the incident which inspired
  Shakespeare's <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>), Brutus, together with her husband
  and father, took a leading part in expelling the Tarquinii from Rome. He
  and Collatinus were therefore elected consuls&mdash;or rather praetors,
  which was the original title (Livy i. 59). In a conspiracy formed for the
  restoration of the dynasty, the two sons of Brutus were deeply
  implicated, and were executed by sentence of their father, and in his
  sight (Livy ii. 3). The Etruscans of Veii and Tarquinii making an attempt
  to restore Tarquinius, a battle took place between them and the Romans,
  in which Junius Brutus engaged Aruns, son of the deposed king, in single
  combat on horseback, and each fell by the other's hand (Livy ii. 6; Dion.
  Halic. v. 14). The Roman matrons mourned a year for him, as "the avenger
  of woman's honour," and a statue was erected to him on the Capitol. The
  conspiracy of his sons is the subject of a tragedy by Voltaire.</p>

  <p>The patrician branch of the family appears to have become extinct with
  L. Junius Brutus; the chief representatives of the plebeian branch in
  later times are dealt with below.</p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">Decimus Junius Brutus</span>, consul 138,
  surnamed Gallaecus from his victory over the Gallaeci (136) in the
  north-west of Spain (Plutarch, <i>Tib. Gracchus</i>, 21). He was a highly
  educated man, a patron of literature, and a friend of the poet Accius
  (Livy, <i>Epit.</i> 55; Appian, <i>Hisp.</i> 71-73; Vell. Pat. ii. 5;
  Cicero, <i>Brutus</i>, 28).</p>

  <p>III. <span class="sc">Marcus Junius Brutus</span>, a jurist of high
  authority, was considered as one of the founders of Roman civil law
  (Cicero, <i>De Oratore</i>, ii. 33, 55).</p>

  <p>IV. His son, of the same name, made a great reputation at the bar, and
  from the vehemence and bitterness of his speeches became known as "the
  Accuser" (Cicero, <i>De Officiis</i>, ii. 15).</p>

  <p>V. <span class="sc">Decimus Junius Brutus</span> (Albinus), born about
  84 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, first served under Caesar in Gaul, and
  afterwards commanded his fleet. Caesar, who esteemed him very highly,
  made him his master of the horse and governor of Gaul, and, in case of
  Octavian's death, nominated him as one of his heirs. Nevertheless he
  joined in the conspiracy against his patron, and, like his relative
  Marcus Junius Brutus (see below), was one of his assassins. He afterwards
  resisted the attempt of Antony to obtain absolute power; and after
  heading the republican armies against him for some time with success, was
  deserted by his soldiers in Gaul, betrayed by one of the native chiefs,
  and put to death by order of Antony (43), while attempting to escape to
  Brutus and Cassius in Macedonia. He figures in Cicero's correspondence.
  (See Appian, <i>B.C.</i> iii. 97; Dio Cassius xlvi. 53; Caesar,
  <i>B.G.</i> iii. 11, <i>B.C.</i> i. 36, 45.)</p>

  <p>VI. <span class="sc">Marcus Junius Brutus</span> (85, according to
  some, 79 or 78-42 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), son of a father of the
  same name and of Servilia, half-sister of Cato of Utica, is the most
  famous of the name, and is the real hero of Shakespeare's <i>Julius
  Caesar.</i> His father had been treacherously put to death by order of
  Pompey during the civil wars. At that time young Marcus was only eight
  years old, and was educated with great care by his mother and uncles. He
  at first practised as an advocate. In spite of his father's fate, he
  supported the cause of Pompey against Caesar, but was pardoned by the
  latter after the victory of Pharsalus, and subsequently appointed by him
  to the government of Cisalpine Gaul (46). His justice and moderation won
  him great honour from the provincials under his rule. In 44 he was city
  praetor, and Caesar promised him the governorship of Macedonia at the
  expiration of his term of office. Influenced probably by his friend Gaius
  Cassius, he afterwards joined in the conspiracy against the great
  dictator, and was one of the foremost in his assassination. He maintained
  the cause of the republic by seizing and holding against Antony's forces
  the province of Macedonia, where he was joined by Cassius. But at
  Philippi (42) they were defeated by Antony and Octavian, and, rather than
  be taken prisoner, he fell on his sword. His wife Porcia, daughter of
  Cato of Utica, afterwards committed suicide, it is said, by swallowing
  red-hot coals (Dio Cassius xlvii. 20-49; Plutarch, <i>Brutus</i>; Appian,
  <i>B.C.</i> iv.; Vell. Paterculus ii. 72).</p>

  <p>Brutus was an earnest student through all his active life, and is said
  to have been working on an abridgment of Pausanias the night before
  Pharsalus. He was generally friendly with Cicero, who dedicated several
  of his works to him (amongst them his <i>Orator</i>), and gave the name
  of <i>Brutus</i> to his dialogue on famous orators; but there were
  frequent disagreements between them, and Cicero frequently speaks of his
  coldness and lack of enthusiasm. It is difficult to understand his great
  influence over the Romans (he was only forty-three when he died);
  probably they admired him for his respectability, the old-fashioned
  <i>gravitas</i>. He was slow in decision, amazingly obstinate, lacking in
  sympathy save towards his womenkind&mdash;who unduly influenced
  him&mdash;and in his financial dealings with the provincials both
  extortionate and cruel (Cic. <i>ad Att.</i> vi. 1. 7). Shakespeare's
  portrait of him is far too flattering. It has been held that he was
  really an illegitimate son of Julius Caesar. If so we may find an
  explanation of his joining the conspirators by the fact that in 45 Caesar
  had appointed Octavian as his heir. He wrote several philosophical
  treatises (<i>de Virtute</i>, <i>de Officiis</i>, <i>de Patientia</i>)
  and some poetry, but nothing has survived. On the other hand, we possess
  part of his correspondence with Cicero (two books out of an original
  nine), the authenticity of which, though formerly disputed, is now
  regarded as firmly established, with the possible exception of two of the
  letters. The letters of Brutus written in Greek are probably the
  composition of some rhetorician.</p>

  <p><b>BRÜX,</b> a town of Bohemia, Austria, 93 m. N.N.W. of Prague by
  rail. Pop. (1900) 21,525. It is dominated by the Schlossberg (1307 ft.),
  on which is situated the ruins of an old castle, demolished in 1651, and
  possesses a very interesting church, in late-Gothic style, built in 1517.
  Brüx is situated in the centre of a region very rich in lignite deposits
  and has, besides, important sugar, iron and hardware, distilling, brewing
  and milling industries. To the south of Brüx are the villages of Püllna,
  Seidlitz and Seidschutz with well-known saline springs. Brüx is mentioned
  in documents of the early 11th century. It fell to the crown under
  P&#x159;emysl I. or Wenceslaus II. <!-- Page 697 --><span

  defeated here by King Sigismund and the Saxons, and in 1426 besieged the
  town in vain. In 1456 George of Pod&#x11B;brad captured the town and

  <p><b>BRY, THEODORUS</b> [<span class="sc">Dirk</span>] <b>DE</b>
  (1528-1598), German engraver and publisher, was born at Liége in 1528. In
  the earlier years of his career he worked at Strassburg. Later he
  established an engraving and publishing business at Frankfort-On-Main,
  and also visited London in or before 1587. Here he became acquainted with
  the geographer Richard Hakluyt, with whose assistance he collected
  materials for a finely illustrated collection of voyages and travels,
  <i>Collectiones Peregrinationum in Indiam Orientalem et Indiam
  Occidentalem</i> (25 parts, 1590-1634). Among other works he engraved a
  set of 12 plates illustrating the Procession of the Knights of the Garter
  in 1576, and a set of 34 plates illustrating the Procession at the
  Obsequies of Sir Philip Sidney; plates for T. Hariot's <i>Briefe and True

  entitled <i>Icones Virorum Illustrium</i> (1597-1599). De Bry died at
  Frankfort on the 27th of March 1598. He had been assisted by his eldest
  son Johannes Theodorus de Bry (1561-1623), who after his father's death
  carried on the <i>Collectiones</i> and the illustration of Boissard's

  College of Law, Chicago, in 1883; during his course he studied in the law
  office of Lyman Trumbull. He practised law at Jacksonville from 1883 to
  1887, when he removed to Lincoln, Nebraska. There he soon became
  conspicuous both as a lawyer and as a politician, attracting particular
  attention by his speeches during the presidential campaign of 1888 on
  behalf of the candidates of the Democratic party. From 1891 to 1895 he
  represented the First Congressional District of Nebraska, normally
  Republican, in the national House of Representatives, and received the
  unusual honour of being placed on the important Committee on Ways and
  Means during his first term. He was a hard and conscientious worker and
  became widely known for his ability in debate. Two of his speeches in
  particular attracted attention, one against the policy of protection
  (16th of March 1892), and the other against the repeal of the silver
  purchase clause of the Sherman Act (16th of August 1893). In the latter
  he advocated the unlimited coinage of silver, irrespective of
  international agreement, at a ratio of 16 to 1, a policy with which his
  name was afterwards most prominently associated. In a campaign largely
  restricted to the question of free-silver coinage he was defeated for
  re-election in 1894, and subsequently was also defeated as the Democratic
  candidate for the United States Senate. As editor of the <i>Omaha
  World-Herald</i> he then championed the cause of bimetallism in the press
  as vigorously as he had in Congress and on the platform, his articles
  being widely quoted and discussed.</p>

  <p>The Democratic party was even more radically divided on the question
  of monetary policy than the Republican; and President Cleveland, by
  securing the repeal of the silver purchase clause in the Sherman Act by
  Republican votes, had alienated a great majority of his party. In the
  Democratic national convention at Chicago in 1896, during a long and
  heated debate with regard to the party platform, Bryan, in advocating the
  "plank" declaring for the free coinage of silver, of which he was the
  author, delivered a celebrated speech containing the passage, "You shall
  not press down upon the brow of labour this crown of thorns; you shall
  not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." This speech made him the idol
  of the "silver" majority of the convention and brought him the Democratic
  nomination for the presidency on the following day. Subsequently he
  received the nominations of the People's and National Silver parties. In
  the ensuing presidential campaign he travelled over 18,000 m. and made
  altogether 600 speeches in 27 different states&mdash;an unprecedented
  number. In the election, however, he was defeated by William McKinley,
  the Republican candidate, receiving 176 electoral votes to 271. But
  though defeated, he remained the leader of his party. Between 1896 and
  1900, except during the Spanish-American War when he was colonel of the
  3rd Nebraska Volunteers, though he saw no active service, he devoted his
  time to the interest of his party. His ability, sincerity of character,
  and wide information, and his attitude towards the new issues arising
  from the war, in which he took the side opposed to "imperialism,"
  increased his following. Although he had advised the ratification of the
  Peace Treaty, he opposed the permanent acquisition of the Philippine
  Islands. In 1900 he was nominated for the presidency by the Democratic,
  Silver Republican, and Populist party conventions; but although
  "imperialism" was declared to be the paramount issue, he had insisted
  that the "platforms" should contain explicit advocacy of free-coinage,
  and this declaration, combined with the popularity of President McKinley,
  the Republican candidate for re-election, again turned the scales against
  him. In the November election after a canvass that almost equalled in
  activity that of 1896 he was again defeated, receiving only 155 electoral
  votes to 292.</p>

  <p>After the 1900 election he established and edited at Lincoln a weekly
  political journal, <i>The Commoner</i>, which attained a wide
  circulation. In 1904 although not actively a candidate for the Democratic
  nomination (which eventually went to Judge Parker), he was to the very
  last considered a possible nominee; and he strenuously opposed in the
  convention the repudiation by the conservative element of the stand taken
  in the two previous campaigns. The decisive defeat of Parker by President
  Roosevelt did much to bring back the Democrats to Mr Bryan's banner. In
  1905-1906 he made a trip round the world, and in London was cordially
  received as a great American orator. He was again nominated for the
  presidency by the Democratic party in 1908. The free-silver theory was
  now dead, and while the main question was that of the attitude to be
  taken towards the Trusts it was much confused by personal issues, Mr
  Roosevelt himself intervening strongly in favour of the Republican
  nominee, Mr Taft. After a heated contest Mr Bryan again suffered a
  decisive defeat, President Taft securing 321 electoral votes to Mr
  Bryan's 162.</p>

  invasion of 1241, Bryansk fell into the power of the Lithuanians; and
  finally became incorporated with the Russian empire in the beginning of
  the 17th century. Bryansk was taken by the followers of the first false
  Demetrius, but it successfully resisted the attacks of the second
  impostor of that name. Under the empress Anne a dock was constructed for
  the building of ships, but it was closed in 1739. In 1783 an arsenal was
  established for the founding of cannon. The cathedral was built in 1526,
  and restored in the end of the 17th century. There are two high schools;
  and the industrial establishments include iron, rope, brick and
  tallow-boiling works, saw-mills and flour-mills, tobacco-factories and a
  brewery. Some distance north of the town are the Maltsov iron-works, with
  glass factories and rope-walks, employing 20,000 men. A considerable
  trade is carried on, especially in wood, tar, hemp, pitch, hemp-seed-oil
  and cattle. In 1867 the population numbered 13,881, and in 1897

  first sent to a school near <!-- Page 698 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page698"></a>[v.04 p.0698]</span>Rochester, whence he was removed
  to Eton. In 1736 he was elected to a scholarship at King's College,
  Cambridge, where he took his degrees of B.A. (1740) and M.A. (1744),
  subsequently being elected a fellow. He returned to Eton as private tutor
  to the duke of Marlborough, then marquess of Blandford; and in 1756 he
  accompanied the duke, then master-general of ordnance and
  commander-in-chief of the forces in Germany, to the continent as private
  secretary. He was rewarded by a lucrative appointment in the ordnance
  department, which allowed him ample leisure to indulge his literary
  tastes. He twice refused the mastership of the Charterhouse. Bryant died
  on the 14th of November 1804 at Cippenham near Windsor. He left his
  library to King's College, having, however, previously made some valuable
  presents from it to the king and the duke of Marlborough. He bequeathed
  £2000 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and £1000 for the
  use of the superannuated collegers of Eton.</p>

  <p>His principal works are: <i>Observations and Inquiries relating to

  <p><b>BRYANT, WILLIAM CULLEN</b> (1794-1878), American poet and
  journalist, was born at Cummington, a farming village in the Hampshire
  hills of western Massachusetts, on the 3rd of November 1794. He was the
  second son of Peter Bryant, a physician and surgeon of no mean
  scholarship, refined in all his tastes, and a public-spirited citizen.
  Peter Bryant was the great-grandson of Stephen Bryant, an English Puritan
  emigrant to Massachusetts Bay about the year 1632. The poet's mother,
  Sarah Snell, was a descendant of "Mayflower" pilgrims. He was born in the
  log farmhouse built by his father two years before, at the edge of the
  pioneer settlement among those boundless forests, the deep stamp of whose
  beauty and majesty he carried on his own mind and reprinted upon the
  emotions of others throughout a long life spent mainly amid the
  activities of his country's growing metropolis. By parentage, by
  religious and political faith, and by hardness of fortune, the earliest
  of important American poets was appointed to a life typical of the first
  century of American national existence, and of the strongest single
  racial element by which that nation's social order has been moulded and
  promoted. Rated by the amount of time given to school books and college
  classes, Bryant's early education was limited. After the village school
  he received a year of exceptionally good training in Latin under his
  mother's brother, the Rev. Dr Thomas Snell, of Brookfield, followed by a
  year of Greek under the Rev. Moses Hallock, of Plainfield, and at sixteen
  entered the sophomore class of Williams College. Here he was an apt and
  diligent student through two sessions, and then, owing to the straitness
  of his father's means, he withdrew without graduating, and studied
  classics and mathematics for a year, in the vain hope that his father
  might yet be able to send him to Yale College. But the length of his
  school and college days would be a very misleading measure of his
  training. He was endowed by nature with many of those traits which it is
  often only the final triumph of books and institutional regimen to
  establish in character, and a double impulse toward scholarship and
  citizenship showed its ruling influence with a precocity and an ardour
  which gave every day of systematic schooling many times its ordinary
  value. It is his own word that, two months after beginning with the Greek
  alphabet, he had read the New Testament through. On abandoning his hope
  to enter Yale, the poet turned to and pursued, under private guidance at
  Worthington and at Bridgewater, the study of law. At twenty-one he was
  admitted to the bar, opened an office in Plainfield, presently withdrew
  from there, and at Great Barrington settled for nine years in the
  attorney's calling, with an aversion for it which he never lost. His
  first book of verse, <i>The Embargo, or Sketches of the Times; A Satire
  by a Youth of thirteen</i>, had been printed at Boston in 1808.</p>

  <p>At the age of twenty-six Bryant married, at Great Barrington, Miss
  Frances Fairchild, with whom he enjoyed a happy union until her death
  nearly half a century later. In the year of his marriage he suffered the
  bereavement of his father's death. In 1825 he ventured to lay aside the
  practice of law, and removed to New York City to assume a literary
  editorship. Here for some months his fortunes were precarious, until in
  the next year he became one of the editors of the <i>Evening Post</i>. In
  the third year following, 1829, he came into undivided editorial control,
  and became also chief owner. He enjoyed his occupation, fulfilling its
  duties with an unflagging devotion to every worthy public interest till
  he died in 1878, in the month of his choice, as indicated in his
  beautiful poem entitled "June."</p>

  <p>Though Bryant's retiring and contemplative nature could not overpower
  his warm human sympathies, it yet dominated them to an extent that made
  him always, even in his journalistic capacity and in the strenuous prose
  of daily debate, a councillor rather than a leader. It was after the
  manner of the poet, the seer, that he was a patriot, standing for
  principles much more than for measures, and, with an exquisite
  correctness which belonged to every phase of his being, never prevailing
  by the accommodation of himself to inferiors in foresight, insight or
  rectitude. His vigorous and stately mind found voice in one of the most
  admirable models of journalistic style known in America. He was founder
  of a distinct school of American journalism, characterized by an equal
  fidelity and temperance, energy and dignity. Though it is as a poet that
  he most emphatically belongs to history, his verse was the expression of
  only the gentler motions of his mind; and it gathers influence, if not
  lustre, when behind it is seen a life intrepid, upright, glad, and ever
  potent for the nobler choice in all the largest affairs of his time. His
  renown as a poet antedated the appearance of his first volume by some
  four or five years. "American poetry," says Richard Henry Stoddard, "may
  be said to have commenced in 1817 with ... (Bryant's) 'Thanatopsis' and
  'Inscription for the entrance of a wood.'" "Thanatopsis," which revealed
  a voice at once as new and as old as the wilderness out of which it
  reverberated, had been written at Cummington in the poet's eighteenth
  year, and was printed in 1817 in the <i>North American Review</i>; the
  "Inscription" was written in his nineteenth, and in his twenty-first,
  while a student of law at Bridgewater, he had composed his lines "To a
  Water-fowl," whose exquisite beauty and exalted faith his own pen rarely,
  if ever, surpassed. The poet's gift for language made him a frequent
  translator, and among his works of this sort his rendering of Homer is
  the most noted and most valuable. But the muse of Bryant, at her very
  best, is always brief-spoken and an interpreter initially of his own
  spirit. Much of the charm of his poems lies in the equal purity of their
  artistic and their moral beauty. On the ethical side they are more than
  pure, they are&mdash;it may be said without derogation&mdash;Puritan. He
  never commerces with unloveliness for any loveliness that may be plucked
  out of it, and rarely or never discovers moral beauty under any sort of
  mask. As free from effeminacy as from indelicacy, his highest and his
  deepest emotions are so dominated by a perfect self-restraint that they
  never rise (or stoop) to transports. There is scarcely a distempered
  utterance in the whole body of his poetical works, scarcely one
  passionate exaggeration. He faces life with an invincible courage, an
  inextinguishable hope and heavenward trust, and the dignity of a
  benevolent will which no compulsion can break or bend. The billows of his
  soul are not waves, but hills which tempests ruffle but can never heave.
  Even when he essays to speak for spirits unlike his own&mdash;characters
  of history or conceptions of his own imagination&mdash;he never with
  signal success portrays <!-- Page 699 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page699"></a>[v.04 p.0699]</span>them in the bonds, however
  transient, of any overmastering passion. For merriment he has a generous
  smile, for sorrow a royal one; but the nearest he ever comes to mirth is
  in his dainty rhyme, "Robert of Lincoln," and the nearest to a wail in
  those exquisite notes of grief for the loss of his young sister, "The
  Death of the Flowers," which only draw the tear to fill it with the light
  of a perfect resignation. As a seer of large and noble contemplation, in
  whose pictures of earth and sky the presence and care of the Divine mind,
  and every tender and beautiful relation of man to his Creator and to his
  fellow, are melodiously celebrated, his rank is among the master poets of
  America, of whom he is historically the first.</p>

  <p>Bryant published volumes of <i>Poems</i> in 1821 (Cambridge) and 1832
  (New York), and many other collections were issued under his supervision,
  the last being the <i>Poetical Works</i> (New York, 1876). Among his
  volumes of verse were "The Fountain" and other poems (New York, 1842);
  <i>The White-Footed Deer and Other Poems</i> (New York, 1844); <i>Thirty
  Poems</i> (New York, 1864); and blank-verse translations of <i>The Iliad
  of Homer</i> (Boston, 1870) and of <i>The Odyssey of Homer</i> (Boston,
  1871). His <i>Poetical Works</i> and his <i>Complete Prose Writings</i>
  (New York, 1883 and 1884) were edited by Parke Godwin, who also wrote
  <i>A Biography of William Cullen Bryant, with Extracts from his private
  Correspondence</i> (New York, 1883). See also J. Grant Wilson, <i>Bryant
  and his Friends</i> (New York, 1886); John Bigelow, <i>William Cullen
  Bryant</i> (Boston, 1890), in the "American Men of Letters" series; W.A.

  historic difficulties. He also made a great statue of Apollo, set up at

  <p><b>BRYCE, JAMES</b> (1838- ), British jurist, historian and
  politician, son of James Bryce (LL.D. of Glasgow, who had a school in
  Belfast for many years), was born at Belfast, Ireland, on the 10th of May
  1838. After going through the high school and university courses at
  Glasgow, he went to Trinity College, Oxford, and in 1862 was elected a
  fellow of Oriel. He went to the bar and practised in London for a few
  years, but he was soon called back to Oxford as regius professor of civil
  law (1870-1893). His reputation as a historian had been made as early as
  1864 by his <i>Holy Roman Empire</i>. He was an ardent Liberal in
  politics, and in 1880 he was elected to parliament for the Tower Hamlets
  division of London; in 1885 he was returned for South Aberdeen, where he
  was re-elected on succeeding occasions. His intellectual distinction and
  political industry made him a valuable member of the Liberal party. In
  1886 he was made under secretary for foreign affairs; in 1892 he joined
  the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; in 1894 he was
  president of the Board of Trade, and acted as chairman of the royal
  commission on secondary education; and in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's
  cabinet (1905) he was made chief secretary for Ireland; but in February
  1907 he was appointed British ambassador at Washington, and took leave of
  party politics, his last political act being a speech outlining what was
  then the government scheme for university reform in Dublin&mdash;a scheme
  which was promptly discarded by his successor Mr Birrell. As a man of
  letters Mr Bryce was already well known in America. His great work <i>The
  American Commonwealth</i> (1888; revised edition, 1910) was the first in
  which the institutions of the United States had been thoroughly discussed
  from the point of view of a historian and a constitutional lawyer, and it
  at once became a classic. His <i>Studies in History and Jurisprudence</i>
  (1901) and <i>Studies in Contemporary Biography</i> (1903) were
  republications of essays, and in 1897, after a visit to South Africa, he
  published a volume of <i>Impressions</i> of that country, which had
  considerable weight in Liberal circles when the Boer War was being
  discussed. Meanwhile his academic honours from home and foreign
  universities multiplied, and he became a fellow of the Royal Society in
  1894. In earlier life he was a notable mountain-climber, ascending Mount
  Ararat in 1876, and publishing a volume on <i>Transcaucasia and
  Ararat</i> in 1877; in 1899-1901 he was president of the Alpine Club.</p>

  <p><b>BRYDGES, SIR SAMUEL EGERTON</b> (1762-1837), English genealogist
  and miscellaneous writer, was born on the 30th of November 1762. He
  studied at Queens' College, Cambridge, and was entered at the Middle
  Temple in 1782, being called to the bar in 1787. In 1789 he persuaded his
  elder brother that their family were the heirs to the barony of Chandos,
  being descended from a younger branch of the Brydges who first held the
  title. The case was tried and lost, but Brydges never gave up his claim,
  and used to sign himself <i>Per legem terrae</i> B.C. of S. (<i>i.e.</i>
  Baron Chandos of Sudeley). He re-edited Collins's <i>Peerage</i>,
  inserting a statement about his supposed right. In 1814 he was made a
  baronet, and in 1818 he left England. He died at Geneva on the 8th of
  September 1837. Sir Egerton was a most prolific author; he is said to
  have written 2000 sonnets in one year. His numerous works include
  <i>Poems</i> (1785); <i>Centura Literaria</i> (1805-1809); <i>The British
  Bibliographer</i> (4 vols., 1810-1814), with J. Haslewood;
  <i>Restituta</i> (4 vols., 1814-1816), containing accounts of old books;
  and <i>Autobiography, Times, Opinions and Contemporaries of Sir S.E.
  Brydges</i> (1834). In 1813 Brydges began to supply material to a private
  printing press established at Lee Priory, Kent, by a compositor and a
  pressman, who were to receive any profits which might arise from the sale
  of the works published. In this way Brydges published various Elizabethan
  texts, at considerable expense to himself, which increased the services
  he had already rendered to the study of Elizabethan literature by his
  bibliographical works.</p>

  <p><b>BRYENNIUS, NICEPHORUS</b> (1062-1137), Byzantine soldier, statesman
  and historian, was born at Orestias (Adrianople). His father, of the same
  name, had revolted against the feeble Michael VII., but had been defeated
  and deprived of his eyesight. The son, who was distinguished for his
  learning, personal beauty and engaging qualities, gained the favour of
  Alexius I. (Comnenus) and the hand of his daughter Anna, with the titles
  of Caesar (then ranking third) and Panhypersebastos (one of the new
  dignities introduced by Alexius). Bryennius successfully defended the
  walls of Constantinople against the attacks of Godfrey of Bouillon
  (1097); conducted the peace negotiations between Alexius and Bohemund,
  prince of Antioch (1108); and played an important part in the defeat of
  Malik-Shah, the Seljuk sultan of Iconium (1116). After the death of
  Alexius, he refused to enter into the conspiracy set on foot by his
  mother-in-law and wife to depose John, the son of Alexius, and raise
  himself to the throne. His wife attributed his refusal to cowardice, but
  it seems from certain passages in his own work that he really regarded it
  as a crime to revolt against the rightful heir; the only reproach that
  can be brought against him is that he did not nip the conspiracy in the
  bud. He was on very friendly terms with the new emperor John, whom he
  accompanied on his Syrian campaign (1137), but was forced by illness to
  return to Byzantium, where he died in the same year. At the suggestion of
  his mother-in-law he wrote a history (called by him <span title="Hulê Historias" class="grk"
  >&#x1F5D;&lambda;&eta;
  &#x1F39;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&#x1F77;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>,
  materials for a history) of the period from 1057 to 1081, from the
  victory of Isaac I. (Comnenus) over Michael VI. to the dethronement of
  Nicephorus Botaneiates by Alexius. The work has been described as rather
  a family chronicle than a history, the object of which was the
  glorification of the house of Comnenus. Part of the introduction is
  probably a later addition. In addition to information derived from older
  contemporaries (such as his father and father-in-law) Bryennius made use
  of the works of Michael Psellus, John Scylitza and Michael Attaliota. As
  might be expected, his views are biased by personal considerations and
  his intimacy with the royal family, which at the same time, however,
  afforded him unusual facilities for obtaining material. His model was
  Xenophon, whom he has imitated with <!-- Page 700 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page700"></a>[v.04 p.0700]</span>a tolerable
  measure of success; he abstains from an excessive use of simile and
  metaphor, and his style is concise and simple.</p>

  <p><b>BRYNMAWR,</b> a market town of Brecknockshire, Wales, 14½ m. S.E.
  of Brecknock and 156 m. from London by rail. Pop. of urban district
  (1901) 6833. It is on the London &amp; North-Western and Rhymney joint
  railway connecting Rhymney and Abergavenny, being also a junction for a
  branch line to Pontypool via Blaenavon, and the terminus of the Great
  Western line from Newport via Nantyglo. The town owes its origin to the
  development during the first half of the 19th century of ironworks at the
  upper ends of the valleys that converge in its neighbourhood, its site
  being previously known as Waun Helygen (Willow-tree Common). The Nantyglo
  ironworks afford occupation to large numbers of the inhabitants of
  Brynmawr. Both coal and iron ore were formerly worked, but the coal is
  exhausted and the ore unsuitable for modern processes. Brynmawr was
  formed into an ecclesiastical parish in 1875 out of portions of the civil
  parishes of Llanelly and Llangattock. In 1894 this was formed into an
  urban district, which was enlarged in 1900 by the addition of a portion
  of the parish of Aberystruth in Monmouthshire, the whole being at the
  same time consolidated into a civil parish.</p>

  <p><b>BRYN MAWR COLLEGE,</b> an institution of advanced learning for
  women, at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., 5 m. W. of Philadelphia. The
  site occupies 52 acres and overlooks a broad expanse of rolling country.
  The buildings are of grey stone in the Jacobean Gothic style, and consist
  of an administration and lecture hall, a science hall, a library
  containing in 1908 about 55,000 volumes mostly for special study, a
  gymnasium, a hospital and six halls of residence. The requirements for
  matriculation are high; students are required to choose their studies
  according to the "group system," which permits them to specialize in two
  or more subjects; and instruction is given largely by means of lectures.
  The college is open to "hearers" who are not required to matriculate, to
  undergraduate matriculated students who are not studying for a degree, to
  undergraduate matriculated students who are candidates for the degree of
  B.A., and to graduate students who are candidates for the degree of M.A.
  or Ph.D. The government rests in a board of thirteen trustees and sixteen
  directors, all the trustees being members of the board of directors. The
  president of the college is a trustee and director. The institution was
  founded by Dr Joseph W. Taylor (1810-1880), a member of the Society of
  Orthodox Friends, and he provided that the trustees also should be
  members, but otherwise Bryn Mawr College is non-sectarian. It was
  incorporated in 1880, and was opened for instruction in 1885. In 1908 it
  had 419 students.</p>

  <p><b>BRYOPHYTA,</b> the botanical name of the second great subdivision
  of the vegetable kingdom, which includes the mosses and liverworts. They
  are all plants of small, often minute, size, and, as the absence of
  popular names indicates, the different kinds are not commonly recognized.
  Even the distinction between liverworts and mosses is not clearly made,
  not only the former but other small plants of higher groups being
  popularly called mosses. A little careful observation soon shows,
  however, that the Bryophytes form a well-defined class, including several
  subordinate groups. Though their study necessarily involves minute
  observation they possess many features of interest. The adaptations they
  show to their conditions of life are often very perfect and present
  interesting analogies with the adaptive characters of the higher plants.
  They are of great scientific interest not only as representing a special
  type of life-history and organization, but because in several of the
  subordinate groups series of forms can be traced, which enable the
  general course of their evolution to be inferred even in the practical
  absence of fossil remains of any antiquity.</p>

  <p>Bryophytes are very generally distributed over the earth, and those of
  a single country, such as Britain, afford examples of all the chief
  natural groups. Sometimes, as is the case with the bog-mosses and some
  arctic mosses, they may cover considerable tracts. As a rule, however,
  they occupy a subordinate place in the vegetation, and the different
  kinds require to be carefully looked for. Covering, as they often do,
  what would otherwise be bare ground, they are of value in assisting to
  retain moisture in the soil and in preparing the way for its colonization
  by higher plants. Although many forms are capable of withstanding periods
  of drought they succeed best in relatively moist climates and localities.
  This is shown both by their unequal abundance in different localities of
  one country and in their scarcity in certain geographical regions as
  compared with their luxuriance in others.</p>

  <p>The external appearance and general organization show great variety.
  In all mosses and many liverworts (figs. 8, 11) the plant consists of a
  stem bearing small leaves. In a number of liverworts (figs. 2, 7), on the
  other hand, it presents no distinction of stem and leaf, but is a flat,
  dorsiventral body usually closely applied to the substratum on which it
  grows. This, in contradistinction to the leafy shoot, is termed a
  <i>thallus</i>. True roots are never present, the plants being attached
  to the soil by <i>rhizoids</i>, which resemble the root-hairs of higher
  plants.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The reproductive organs borne by the thallus or plant are called
  antheridia and archegonia, and serve for sexual reproduction. The
  <i>antheridium</i> (figs. 5, 15) has a longer or shorter stalk and
  consists of a wall formed of a single layer of flat cells enclosing a
  mass of minute cells from which the spermatozoids are developed. In the
  cases which have been most carefully investigated two spermatozoids have
  been found to arise from each of the small cubical cells of the central
  tissue. When mature the antheridium opens on being moistened and the
  spermatozoids become free in the water by the dissolution of the
  mucilaginous cell-walls enclosing them. Each has the form (fig. 5, D) of
  a more or less spirally twisted, club-shaped body, bearing at the pointed
  anterior end two long cilia by means of which it moves through the water.
  The <i>archegonium</i> (fig. 1) has the form of a narrow flask with a
  long neck. It usually has a short stalk and consists of a central row of
  cells enclosed by a layer of cells forming the wall. The egg-cell or ovum
  lies within the wider basal region or venter, and above it come the
  ventral canal-cell and canal-cells within the neck of the archegonium.
  When the archegonium opens by the separation of the cells at the tip, the
  disorganized canal-cells escape, leaving a narrow tubular passage leading
  down to the ovum. Each antheridium or archegonium arises from a single
  cell, and while the mature structure is similar in the two groups, the
  development presents differences in liverworts and mosses. Without
  entering into details it may be mentioned that in the mosses it proceeds
  both in the archegonium and antheridium by the segmentation of an apical
  cell, while this is not the case in the liverworts. Fertilization is
  effected by the passage of a spermatozoid, attracted probably by means of
  a chemical stimulus, down the passage of the archegonial neck and its
  fusion with the ovum. It thus, as in other cases of sexual reproduction,
  involves the union of <!-- Page 701 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page701"></a>[v.04 p.0701]</span>two cells, and the vegetative
  plant, since it bears the sexual organs, is called the sexual generation
  or <i>gametophyte</i>.</p>

  <p>From the fertilized ovum another and very different stage arises,
  which remains attached to the sexual plant and has thus the appearance of
  a fruit borne on it. It consists of a capsule usually borne on a longer
  or shorter stalk or seta, the base of which is inserted into the tissues
  of the gametophyte. This basal region, which serves to absorb
  nourishment, is called the foot. Within the capsule numerous reproductive
  cells, the spores, are developed. In contrast to the sexual generation
  this stage is called the spore-bearing generation (<i>sporogonium</i>,
  <i>sporophyte</i>). The examination of any moss "in fruit" (fig. 11, B)
  will show the readily detachable sporogonium borne on the leafy sexual
  plant, and the relation existing between the two generations will be
  evident from figs. 2, 3, 9, and 16. In liverworts (with one or two
  exceptions) the mature capsule is filled with spores mingled with sterile
  cells or elaters and opens by splitting into valves. In mosses (fig. 11,
  C) the sporogonium is more highly organized; a central column of sterile
  tissue (the columella) is found in the capsule, which opens by the
  removal of a lid or operculum, and there are no elaters among the spores.
  By the opening of the capsule the spores are set free, and under suitable
  conditions germinate and give rise to the sexual generation. In mosses
  (fig. 12) a filamentous growth, the protonema, is first formed, and the
  leafy plants arise upon this. In liverworts this preliminary phase of the
  sexual generation is as a rule ill-marked or absent, and the plant may be
  said to develop directly from the spore.</p>

  <p>It will be evident that the two generations exhibit a regular
  succession or alternation in the life-history of all Bryophytes. The
  gametophyte is developed from the spore and bears the sexual organs; the
  sporogonium is developed from the fertilized egg and produces spores. An
  important cytological difference between the two generations can only be
  mentioned here. By the union of the nuclei of the spermatozoid and ovum
  in fertilization the number of chromosomes in the resulting nucleus is
  doubled, and this double number is maintained throughout all the
  cell-divisions of the sporogonium. On the development of the spores,
  which takes place by the division of each spore-mother-cell into four,
  the number of chromosomes becomes one half of what it has been in all the
  nuclei of the sporogonium. This reduced number is maintained throughout
  the development of the sexual generation. Thus in <i>Pellia</i> the
  nuclei of the gametophyte have eight chromosomes and those of the
  sporophyte sixteen. The relation in which the two generations stand to
  one another is the most important common characteristic of the Bryophyta.
  The gametophyte is always the independently living individual upon which
  the spore-bearing generation is throughout its life dependent. In all
  plants higher than the Bryophyta the sporophyte becomes an independently
  rooted plant and is the conspicuous stage in the life-history. Thus in
  the fern the sexual generation is the small prothallus developed from the
  spore, while the familiar fern-plant is the spore-bearing generation (see
  <span class="sc">Pteridophyta</span>). On the other hand a corresponding
  alternation of generations is only indicated in the lower plants
  (Thallophyta).</p>

  <p>The Bryophyta are divided into the Hepaticae (liverworts) and Musci
  (mosses). In the Hepaticae we can recognize three subordinate
  groups&mdash;the Marchantiales, Jungermanniales and Anthocerotales; and
  in the Musci also three groups&mdash;the Sphagnales, Andreaeales and
  Bryales. Since these series of forms differ considerably among
  themselves, it is difficult to express in a definition the distinction
  between a liverwort and a moss which is readily made in practice. We may
  therefore leave it to the description of the several groups of Hepaticae
  and Musci to supplement the differences mentioned above and to bring out
  the exceptions which exist.</p>

<h4><i>Hepaticae</i> (Liverworts).</h4>

  <p>The range of form and structure of both generations in the liverworts
  is so great that no one form can be taken as a satisfactory type. It
  will, however, be of use to preface the more general description by a
  brief account of a particular example, and we may take for this purpose a
  very common and easily recognized thalloid liverwort belonging to the
  Jungermanniales.</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>Pellia epiphylla</i> (fig. 2) can be found at any season growing in
  large patches on the damp soil of woods, banks, &amp;c. The broad flat
  thallus is green and may be a couple of inches long. It is sparingly
  branched, the branching being apparently dichotomous; the growing point
  is situated in a depression at the anterior end of each branch. The
  wing-like lateral portions of the thallus gradually thin out from the
  midrib; from the projecting lower surface of this numerous rhizoids
  spring. These are elongated superficial cells, and serve to fix the
  thallus to the soil and obtain water and salts from it. No leaf-like
  appendages are borne on the thallus, but short glandular hairs occur
  behind the apex. The plant is composed throughout of very similar living
  cells, the more superficial ones containing numerous chlorophyll grains,
  while starch is stored in the internal cells of the midrib. The cells
  contain a number of oil-bodies the function of which is imperfectly
  understood. The growth of the thallus proceeds by the regular
  segmentation of a single apical cell. The sexual organs are borne on the
  upper surface, and both antheridia and archegonia occur on the same
  branch (fig. 3, A). The antheridia (<i>an</i>) are scattered over the
  middle region of the thallus, and each is surrounded by a tubular
  upgrowth from the surface. The archegonia (<i>ar</i>) are developed in a
  group behind the apex, and the latter continues to grow for a time after
  their formation, so that they come to be seated in a depression of the
  upper surface. They are further protected by the growth of the hinder
  margin of the depression to form a scale-like involucre (<i>in</i>).
  Fertilization takes place about June, and the sporogonium is fully
  developed by the winter. The embryo developed from the fertilized ovum
  consists at first of a number of tiers of cells. Its terminal tier gives
  rise to the capsule, the first divisions in the four cells of the tier
  marking off the wall of the capsule from the cells destined to produce
  the spores. In fig. 4, C, which represents a longitudinal section of a
  young embryo of <i>Pellia</i>, these archesporial cells are shaded. The
  tiers below give rise to the seta and foot. The mature sporogonium (fig.
  3, B) consists of the foot embedded in the tissue of the thallus, the
  seta, which remains short until just before the shedding of the spores,
  and the spherical capsule. It remains for long enclosed within the
  calyptra formed by the further development of the archegonial wall and
  surmounted by the neck of the archegonium. The calyptra is ultimately
  burst through, and in early spring the seta elongates rapidly, raising
  the dark-coloured capsule (fig. 2). In the young condition the wall of
  the capsule, which consists of two layers of cells, encloses a mass of
  similar cells developed from the archesporium. Some of these become
  spore-mother-cells and give rise by cell division to four spores, while
  others remain undivided and become the elaters. The latter are elongated
  spindle-shaped cells with thick brown spiral bands on the inside of their
  thin walls. They radiate out from a small plug of sterile cells
  projecting into the base of the capsule, and some are attached to this,
  while others lie free among the spores. The latter are large, and at
  first are unicellular; but in <i>Pellia</i>, which in this respect is
  exceptional, they commence their further development within the capsule,
  and thus consist of several cells when shed. <!-- Page 702 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page702"></a>[v.04 p.0702]</span>The cells of
  the capsule wall have incomplete, brown, thickened rings on their walls,
  and the capsule opens by splitting into four valves, which bend away from
  one another, allowing the loose spores to be readily dispersed by the
  wind, assisted by the hygroscopic movements of the elaters. On falling
  upon damp soil the spores germinate, growing into a thallus, which
  gradually attains its full size and bears sexual organs.</p>

  </div>
  <p>While the general course of the life-history of all liverworts
  resembles that of <i>Pellia</i>, the three great groups into which they
  are divided differ from one another in the characters of both
  generations. Each group exhibits a series leading from more simple to
  more highly organized forms, and the differentiation has proceeded on
  distinct and to some extent divergent lines in the three groups. The
  Marchantiales are a series of thalloid forms, in which the structure of
  the thallus is specialized to enable them to live in more exposed
  situations. The lowest members of the series (<i>Riccia</i>) possess the
  simplest sporogonia known, consisting of a wall of one layer of cells
  enclosing the spores. In the higher forms a sterile foot and seta is
  present, and sterile cells or elaters occur with the spores. The lower
  members of the Jungermanniales are also thalloid, but the thallus never
  has the complicated structure characteristic of the Marchantiales, and
  progress is in the direction of the differentiation of the plant into
  stem and leaf. Indications of how this may have come about are afforded
  by the lower group of the Anacrogynous Jungermanniaceae, and throughout
  the Acrogynous Jungermanniacae the plant has well-marked stem and leaves.
  The sporogonium even in the simplest forms has a sterile foot, but in
  this series also the origin of elaters from sterile cells can be traced.
  The Anthocerotales are a small and very distinct group, in which the
  gametophyte is a thallus, while the sporogonium possesses a sterile
  columella and is capable of long-continued growth and spore production.
  The mode of development of the sporogonium presents important differences
  in the three series that may be briefly referred to here. In fig. 4 young
  sporogonia of a number of liverworts are shown in longitudinal section,
  and the archesporial cells from which the spores and elaters will arise
  are shaded. In <i>Riccia</i> (fig. 4, A) the whole mass of cells derived
  from the ovum forms a spherical capsule, the only sterile tissue being
  the single layer of peripheral cells forming the wall. In other
  Marchantiales (fig. 4, B) the lower half of the embryo separated by the
  first transverse wall (1, I) forms the sterile foot and seta, while in
  the upper half (<i>ka</i>) the peripheral layer forms the wall of the
  capsule, enclosing the archesporial cells from which spores and elaters
  arise. In the Jungermanniales (fig. 4, C, E, F) the embryo is formed of a
  number of tiers of cells, and the archesporium is defined by the first
  divisions parallel to the surface in the cells of one or more of the
  upper tiers; a number of tiers go to form the seta and foot, while the
  lowest segment (<i>a</i>) usually forms a small appendage of the latter.
  In the Anthocerotales (fig. 4, D) the lowest tiers form the foot, and the
  terminal tier the capsule. The first periclinal divisions in the cells of
  the terminal tier separate a central group of cells which form the
  sterile columella (<i>col</i>). The archesporium arises by the next
  divisions in the outer layer of cells, and thus extends over the summit
  of the columella. In none of the liverworts does the sporogonium develop
  by means of an apical cell, as is the rule in mosses.</p>

  <p>Leaving details of form and structure to be considered under the
  several groups, some general features of the Hepaticae may be looked at
  here in relation to the conditions under which the plants live. The
  organization of the gametophyte stands in the closest relation to the
  factors of light and moisture in the environment. With hardly an
  exception the liverworts are dorsiventral, and usually one side is turned
  to the substratum and the other exposed to the light. In thalloid forms a
  thinner marginal expansion or a definite wing increasing the surface
  exposed to the light can be distinguished from a thicker midrib serving
  for storage and conduction. The leaves and stem of the foliose forms
  effect the same division of labour in another way. The relation of the
  plant to its water supply varies within the group. In the Marchantiales
  the chief supply is obtained from the soil by the rhizoids, and its loss
  in transpiration is regulated and controlled. In most liverworts, on the
  other hand, water is absorbed directly by the whole general surface, and
  the rhizoids are of subordinate importance. Many forms only succeed in a
  constantly humid atmosphere, while others sustain drying for a period,
  though their powers of assimilation and growth are suspended in the dry
  state. The cell-walls are capable of imbibing water rapidly, and their
  thickness stands in relation to this rather than to the prevention of
  loss of water from the plant. The large surface presented by the leafy
  forms facilitates the retention and absorption of water. The importance
  of prolonging the moistened condition as long as possible is further
  shown by special adaptations to retain water either between the appressed
  lobes of the leaves or in special pitcher-like sacs. In thalloid forms
  fimbriate or lobed margins or outgrowths from the surface lead to the
  same result. Sometimes adaptations to protect the plant during seasons of
  drought, such as the rolling up of the thallus in many xerophytic
  Marchantiales, can be recognized, but more often a prolonged dry season
  is survived in some resting state. The formation of subterranean tubers,
  which persist when the rest of the plant is killed by drought, is an
  interesting adaptation to this end, and is found in all three groups
  (<i>e.g.</i> in species of <i>Riccia</i>, <i>Fossombronia</i> and
  <i>Anthoceros</i>). No examples of total saprophytism or of parasitism
  are known, but two interesting cases of a symbiosis with other organisms
  which is probably a mutually beneficial one, though the nature of the
  physiological relation between the organisms is not clearly established,
  may be mentioned. Fungal hyphae occur in the rhizoids and in the cells of
  the lower region of the thallus of many liverworts, as in the endotrophic
  mycorhiza of higher plants. Colonies of <i>Nostoc</i> are constantly
  found in the Anthocerotaceae and in <i>Blasia</i>. In the latter they are
  protected by special concave scales, while in the Anthocerotaceae they
  occupy some of the mucilage slits between the cells of the lower surface
  of the thallus.</p>

  <p>Other adaptations concern the protection of the sexual organs and
  sporogonia, and the retention of water in the neighbourhood of the
  archegonia to enable the spermatozoid to reach the ovum. In thalloid
  forms the sexual organs are often sunk in depressions, while in the
  foliose forms protection is afforded by the surrounding leaves. In
  addition special involucres around the archegonia have arisen
  independently in several series. The characters of the sporogonium have
  as their object the nutrition and effective distribution of the spores,
  and only exceptionally, as in the Anthocerotaceae, are concerned with
  independent assimilation. In most forms the capsule is raised above the
  general surface at the time of opening, usually by the rapid growth of
  the seta, but in the Marchantiaceae by the sporogonia being raised on a
  special archegoniophore. The elaters serve as lines of conduction of
  plastic material to the developing spores, and later usually assist in
  their dispersal. The spores, with few exceptions, are unicellular when
  shed, and may develop at once or after a resting period. In their
  germination a short filament of a few cells is usually developed, and the
  apical cell of the plant is established in the terminal cell. In other
  cases a small plate or mass of cells is formed. With one or two
  exceptions, however, this preliminary <!-- Page 703 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page703"></a>[v.04 p.0703]</span>phase, which
  may be compared with the protonema of mosses, is of short duration.</p>

  <p>The power of vegetative propagation is widely spread. When
  artificially divided small fragments of the gametophyte are found to be
  capable of growing into new individuals. Apart from the separation of
  branches by the decay of older portions, special gemmae are found in many
  species. In <i>Aneura</i> the contents of superficial cells, after
  becoming surrounded by a new wall and dividing, escape as bi-cellular
  gemmae. Usually the gemmae arise by the outgrowth of superficial cells,
  and become free by breaking away from their stalk. When separated they
  may be single cells or consist of two or numerous cells. In <i>Blasia</i>
  and <i>Marchantia</i> the gemmae are formed within tubular or cup-shaped
  receptacles, out of which they are forced by the swelling of mucilage
  secreted by special hairs.</p>

  stones by the waterside, while <i>Dumortiera</i> is a hygrophyte confined
  to damp and shady situations. Among the Ricciaceae, most of which grow on
  soil, <i>Ricciocarpus</i> and <i>Riccia natans</i> occur floating on
  still water. The dorsiventral thallus is constructed on the same plan
  throughout the group, and shows a lower region composed of cells
  containing little chlorophyll and an upper stratum specialized for
  assimilation and transpiration. The lower region usually forms a more or
  less clearly marked midrib, and consists of parenchymatous cells, some of
  which may contain oil-bodies or be differentiated as mucilage cells or
  sclerenchyma fibres. Behind the apex, which has a number of initial
  cells, a series of amphigastria or ventral scales is formed. These
  consist of a single layer of cells, and their terminal appendages often
  fold over the apex and protect it. Usually they stand in two rows, but
  sometimes accessory rows occur, and in <i>Riccia</i> only a single median
  row is present. The thallus bears two sorts of rhizoids, wider ones with
  smooth walls which grow directly down into the soil, and longer, narrower
  ones, with peg-like thickenings of the wall projecting into the
  cell-cavity. The peg-rhizoids, which are peculiar to the group, converge
  under shelter of the amphigastria to the midrib, beneath which they form
  a wick-like strand. Through this water is conducted by capillarity as
  well as in the cell cavities. The upper stratum of the thallus is
  constructed to regulate the giving off of the water thus absorbed. It
  consists of a series of air-chambers (fig. 6, B) formed by certain lines
  of the superficial cells growing up from the surface, and as the thallus
  increases in area continuing to divide so as to roof in the chamber. The
  layer forming the roof is called the "epidermis," and the small opening
  left leading into the chamber is bounded by a special ring of cells and
  forms the "stoma" or air-pore. In most species of <i>Riccia</i> the
  air-chambers are only narrow passages, but in the other Marchantiales
  they are more extended. In the simplest cases the sides and base of the
  chambers perform the work of assimilation (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Corsinia</i>).
  Usually the surface is extended by the development of partitions in the
  chambers (<i>Reboulia</i>), or by the growth from the floor of the
  chamber of short filaments of chlorophyllous cells (<i>Targionia</i>.
  <i>Marchantia</i>, fig. 6). The stomata may be simply surrounded by one
  or more series of narrower cells, or, as in the thallus of
  <i>Marchantia</i> and on the archegoniophores of other forms, may become
  barrel-shaped structures by the division of the ring of cells bounding
  the pore. In some cases the lowermost circle of cells can be approximated
  so as to close the pore. In <i>Dumortiera</i> the air-chambers are
  absent, their formation being only indicated at the apex.</p>

  <p>The sexual organs are always situated on the morphologically upper
  surface of the thallus. In <i>Riccia</i> they are scattered singly and
  protected by the air-chamber layer. The scattered position of the
  antheridia is also found in some of the higher forms, but usually they
  are grouped on special antheridiophores which in <i>Marchantia</i> are
  stalked, disk-shaped branch-systems (fig. 5). The individual antheridia
  are sunk in depressions from which the spermatozoids are in some cases
  forcibly ejected. The archegonial groups in <i>Corsinia</i> are sunk in a
  depression of the upper surface, while in <i>Targionia</i> they are
  displaced to the lower side of the anterior end of a branch. In all the
  other forms they are borne on special archegoniophores which have the
  form of a disk-shaped head borne on a stalk. The archegoniophore may be
  an upgrowth from the dorsal surface of the thallus (<i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Plagiochasma</i>), or the apex of the branch may take part in its
  formation. When the disk, around which archegonia are developed at
  intervals, is simply raised on a stalk-like continuation of the branch, a
  single groove protecting a strand of peg-rhizoids is found on the ventral
  face of the stalk (<i>Reboulia</i>). In the highest forms (<i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Marchantia</i>) the archegoniophore corresponds to the repeatedly
  branched continuation of the thallus, and the archegonia arise in
  relation to the growing points which are displaced to the lower surface
  of the disk. In this case two grooves are found in the stalk. The
  archegonia are protected by being sunk in depressions of the disk or by a
  special two-lipped involucre. In <i>Marchantia</i> and <i>Fimbriaria</i>
  an additional investment termed in descriptive works the perianth, grows
  up around each fertilized archegonium (fig. 1, 3, <i>d</i>). The simple
  sporogonium found in the Ricciaceae (fig. 4, A) has been described above;
  as the spores develop, the wall of the spherical capsule is absorbed and
  the spores lie free in the calyptra, by the decay of which they are set
  free. In <i>Corsinia</i> the capsule has a well-developed foot, but the
  sterile cells found among the spore-mother-cells do not become elaters,
  but remain thin-walled and simply contribute to the nutrition of the
  spores. In all other forms elaters with spirally thickened walls are
  found. The seta is short, the capsule being usually raised upon the
  archegoniophore. Dehiscence takes place either by the upper portion of
  the capsule splitting into short teeth or falling away as a whole or in
  fragments as a sort of operculum. The spores on germination form a short
  germ-tube, in the terminal cell of which the apical cell is established,
  but the direction of growth of the young thallus is usually not in the
  same straight line as the germ-tube. The Marchantiales are divided into a
  number of groups which represent distinct lines of advance from forms
  like the Ricciaceae, but the details of their classification cannot be
  entered upon here. The general nature of the progression exhibited by the
  group as a whole will, however, be evident from the above account.</p>

  <p><i>Jungermanniales.</i>&mdash;This large series of liverworts, which
  presents great variety in the organization of the sexual generation, is
  divided into two main groups according to whether the formation of
  archegonia terminates the growth of the branch or does not utilize the
  apex. The latter condition is characteristic of the more primitive group
  of the Anacrogynous Jungermanniaceae, in which the branch continues its
  growth after the formation of archegonia so that they (and later the
  sporogonia) stand on the dorsal surface of the thallus or leafy plant. In
  the Acrogynous Jungermanniaceae the plant is throughout foliose, and the
  archegonia occupy the ends of the main shoot or of its branches. The
  antheridia are usually globular and long-stalked. The capsule opens by
  splitting into four halves.</p>

  <p><i>Jungermanniaceae Anacrogynae.</i>&mdash;The great range of form in
  the sexual plant is well illustrated by the nine genera of this group
  <!-- Page 704 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page704"></a>[v.04
  p.0704]</span>which occur in Britain. One thalloid form has already been
  described in <i>Pellia</i> (fig. 2). <i>Sphaerocarpus</i>, which occurs
  rarely in stubble fields, is in many respects one of the simplest of the
  liverworts. The small thallus bears the antheridia and archegonia, each
  of which is surrounded by a tubular involucre, on the upper surface of
  distinct individuals. The sporogonium has a small foot, but the sterile
  cells among the spores do not develop into elaters. The same is true of
  the capsule of <i>Riella</i>. The plants of this genus, none of the
  species of which are British, grow in shallow water rooted in the mud,
  and are unlike all other liverworts in appearance. The usually erect
  thallus has a broad wing-like outgrowth from the dorsal surface and two
  rows of rather large scales below. No provision for the opening of the
  capsule exists in either of these genera. In <i>Aneura</i> the form of
  the plant may be complicated by a division of labour between root-like,
  stem-like and assimilating branches of the thallus. The sexual organs are
  borne on short lateral branches, while in the related genus
  <i>Metzgeria</i>, which occurs on rocks and tree trunks, the small sexual
  branches spring from the lower surface of the midrib of the narrow
  thallus. In these two genera the elaters are attached to a sterile group
  of cells projecting into the upper end of the capsule, and on dehiscence
  remain connected with the tips of the valves. <i>Pallavicinia</i> and
  some related genera have a definite midrib and broad wings formed of one
  layer of cells, and are of interest owing to the presence of a special
  water-conducting strand in the midrib. This consists of elongated
  lignified cells with pitted walls. <i>Blasia pusilla</i>, which occurs
  commonly by ditches and streams, affords a transition to the foliose
  types. Its thallus (fig. 7) has thin marginal lobes of limited growth,
  which are comparable to the more definite leaves of other anacrogynous
  forms. The ventral surface bears flat scales in addition to the concave
  scales which, as mentioned above, are inhabited by <i>Nostoc</i>. This
  interesting liverwort produces two kinds of gemmae, and in the localities
  in which it grows is largely reproduced by their means. In
  <i>Fossombronia</i>, of which there are a number of British species, the
  plant consists of a flattened stem creeping on muddy soil and bearing two
  rows of large obliquely-placed leaves. The sexual organs are borne on the
  upper surface of the midrib, and the sporogonium is surrounded by a
  bell-shaped involucre which grows up after fertilization. <i>Treubia</i>,
  which grows on rotting wood in the mountain forests of Java, is similarly
  differentiated into stem and leaf, and is the largest liverwort known,
  reaching a length of thirty centimetres. Lastly <i>Haplomitrium</i>, a
  rare British genus, forms with the exotic <i>Calobryum</i>, an isolated
  group which is most naturally placed among the anacrogynous forms
  although the archegonia are in terminal groups. The erect branches bear
  three rows of leaves, and spring from a creeping axis from which
  root-like branches destitute of rhizoids extend into the substratum.</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>Jungermanniaceae Acrogynae.</i>&mdash;The plant consists of leafy
  shoots, the origin of which can be understood in the light of the foliose
  forms described above. The great majority of existing liverworts belong
  to this group, the general plan of construction of which is throughout
  very similar. In Britain thirty-nine genera with numerous species are
  found. With few exceptions the stem grows by means of a pyramidal apical
  cell cutting off three rows of segments. Each segment gives rise to a
  leaf, but usually the leaves of the ventral row (amphigastria) are
  smaller and differently shaped from those of the two lateral rows; in a
  number of genera they are wanting altogether. Sometimes the leaves retain
  their transverse insertion on the stem, and the two lobes of which they
  consist are developed equally. More often they come to be obliquely
  inserted, the anterior edge of each leaf lying under or over the edge of
  the leaf in front. The two lobes are often unequally developed. In
  <i>Scapania</i> the upper lobe is the smaller, while in <i>Radula</i>,
  <i>Poretta</i> and the <i>Lejeuneae</i> this is the case with the lower
  lobe. The folding of one lobe against another assists in the retention of
  water. Pitcher-like structures have arisen in different ways in a number
  of genera, and are especially common in epiphytic forms
  (<i>Frullania</i>, <i>Lepidolaena</i>, <i>Pleurozia</i>). In some forms
  the leaves are finely divided, and along with the hair-like paraphyllia
  form a loose weft around the stem (<i>Trichocolea</i>). The rhizoids
  spring from the lower surface of the stem, and sometimes from the bases
  of the leaves. The branches arise below and by the side of the
  leaves.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The sexual organs may occur on the same or on distinct individuals.
  The antheridia are protected by leaves which are often modified in shape.
  The archegonia are borne at the apex of the main stem or of a lateral
  branch. A single archegonium may arise from the apical cell
  (<i>Lejeunea</i>); more commonly a number of others are formed from the
  surrounding segments. The leaves below the archegonial group are
  frequently modified in size and shape, but the chief protection is
  afforded by a tubular perianth, which corresponds to a coherent whorl of
  leaves and grows up independently of fertilization. The perianth serves
  also to enclose and protect the sporogonium during its development. In a
  number of forms belonging to different groups the end of the stem on
  which the sporogonium is borne grows downwards so as to form a hollow
  tubular sac enclosing the sporogonium; in other cases this marsupial sac
  is formed by the base of the sporogonium boring into the thickened end of
  the stem. The sac usually penetrates into the soil and bears rhizoids on
  its outer surface. <i>Kantia</i>, <i>Calypogeia</i> and <i>Saccogyna</i>
  are British forms, which have their sporogonia protected in this way. The
  sporogonium is very similar throughout the group (figs. 8, 9). At
  maturity the seta elongates rapidly, and the wall of the capsule splits
  more or less completely into four valves, allowing the elaters and spores
  to escape. In the Jubuloideae, which in other respects form a well-marked
  group, the seta is short and the elaters extend from the upper part of
  the capsule to the base; at dehiscence they remain fixed to the valves
  into which the capsule splits. The germinating spore usually forms a
  short filament, but in other cases a flat plate of cells growing by a
  two-sided apical cell is first formed (<i>Radula</i>, <i>Lejeunea</i>).
  In one or two tropical forms the pro-embryonic stage is prolonged, and
  leafy shoots only arise in connexion with the sexual organs. In
  <i>Protocephalozia</i>, which grows on bare earth in South America, this
  pro-embryo is filamentous, while in <i>Lejeunea Metzgeriopsis</i>, which
  grows on the leaves of living plants, it is a flat branched thallus
  closely applied to the substratum. Other cases of the plant being, with
  the exception of the sexual branches, apparently thalloid, are on the
  other hand to be explained as due to the reduction of the leaves and
  flattening of the stem of a shoot (<i>Pteropsiella</i>,
  <i>Zoopsis</i>).</p>

  <p>The Acrogynous Jungermanniaceae fall into a number of natural groups,
  which cannot, however, be followed out here. They occur in very various
  situations, on the ground, on rocks and stones, on tree trunks, and, in
  the damp tropics, on leaves. Usually they form larger or smaller tufts of
  a green colour, but some forms have a reddish tint.</p>

  <p><i>Anthocerotales.</i>&mdash;This small and very natural group
  includes the three genera <i>Anthoceros</i>, <i>Dendroceros</i> and
  <i>Notothylas</i>, and stands in <!-- Page 705 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page705"></a>[v.04 p.0705]</span>many respects
  in an isolated position among the Bryophyta. Three species of
  <i>Anthoceros</i> occur in Britain, growing on the damp soil of fields,
  ditches, &amp;c. The dark green thallus has an ill-defined midrib, and is
  composed of parenchymatous cells. In each assimilating cell there is
  usually a single large chloroplast. The apical region, which has a single
  initial cell, is protected by mucilage secreted by the mucilage slits,
  which are small pit-like depressions between superficial cells of the
  lower surface. Mucilage is also often formed in intercellular spaces
  within the thallus. Colonies of <i>Nostoc</i> are constantly found living
  in some of the mucilage slits which then become enlarged. The sexual
  organs are scattered over the upper surface. The stalked globular
  antheridia are exceptional in being formed endogenously, and are situated
  in groups in special intercellular spaces. The superficial layer of cells
  bounding the cavity does not break down until the antheridia are nearly
  mature. Occasionally antheridia develop on the surface of shaded portions
  of the thallus. The necks of the archegonia hardly project above the
  general surface of the thallus. In structure and development they agree
  with other Hepaticae, though differences of detail exist. The young
  sporogonium is protected by a thick calyptra derived from the tissue of
  the thallus around the archegonium. The sporogonium consists of a large
  bulbous foot, the superficial cells of which grow out into processes, and
  a long capsule, which continues to grow for months by the activity of a
  zone of cells between it and the foot, and may attain the length of an
  inch and a half. The wall of the capsule is several layers of cells
  thick, and since the epidermis contains functional stomata and the
  underlying cells possess chlorophyll it is capable of assimilation. In
  the centre of the capsule is a strand of narrow elongated cells forming
  the columella, and between this and the wall spores mixed with elaters
  are formed from the dome-shaped archesporium, the origin of which has
  already been described (fig. 4, D). The capsule opens by splitting into
  two valves from the apex downwards, and the mature spores escape while
  others are developing in succession below. In <i>Dendroceros</i>, which
  grows as an epiphyte in the tropics, the thallus has a well-defined
  midrib and broad wings composed of a single layer of cells. The capsule
  is similar to that of <i>Anthoceros</i>, but has no stomata, and the
  elaters have spirally thickened walls. Some species of <i>Anthoceros</i>
  agree with it in these respects. <i>Notothylas</i> resembles
  <i>Anthoceros</i> in its thallus, but the sporogonium is much smaller. In
  some species, although the columella and archesporium arise in the usual
  way, both give rise to mingled spores and elaters, and no sterile
  columella is developed.</p>

<h4><i>Musci</i> (Mosses).</h4>

  <p>Though the number of species of mosses is far greater than of
  liverworts, the group offers much less diversity of form. The sexual
  generation is always a leafy plant, which is not developed directly from
  the spore but is borne on a well-marked and usually filamentous
  protonema. The general course of the life-history and the main features
  of form and structure will be best understood by a brief account of a
  particular example.</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>Funaria hygrometrica</i> is a moss of very common occurrence even
  in towns on the soil of paths, at the foot of walls and in similar
  places. The small plants grow closely crowded in tufts, and consist of
  short leafy shoots attached to the soil by numerous fine rhizoids. The
  latter, in contrast to the rhizoids of liverworts, are composed of rows
  of elongated cells and are branched. The leaves are simple, and except
  for the midrib are only one layer of cells thick. The structure of the
  stem though simple is more complicated than in any liverwort. The
  superficial cells are thick-walled, and there is a central strand of
  narrow cells forming a water-conducting tissue. The small strand of
  elongated cells in the midrib of the leaf runs down into the stem, but is
  not usually connected with the central strand. The sexual organs are
  developed in groups at the apices, the antheridial group usually
  terminating the main axis while the archegonia are borne on a lateral
  branch. The brown tint of the hair-like paraphyses mixed with antheridia
  (fig. 15) makes the male branch conspicuous, while the archegonia have to
  be carefully looked for enclosed by the surrounding leaves (fig. 16, B).
  The sporogonium developed from the fertilized ovum grows by means of a
  two-sided apical cell (fig. 16 A), and is at first of uniform thickness.
  After a time the upper region increases in diameter and forms the
  capsule, while the lower portion forms the long seta and the foot which
  is embedded in the end of the stem. With the growth of the sporogonium
  the archegonial wall, which for a time kept pace with it, is broken
  through, the larger upper part terminated by the neck being carried up on
  the capsule as the calyptra, while the basal portion remains as a tubular
  sheath round the lower end of the seta (cf. figs. 16, C, and fig. 11, A,
  B). The seta widens out at the base of the capsule into a region known as
  the apophysis. The peripheral cells of the seta are thick-walled, and it
  has a central strand of elongated conducting cells. In the epidermis of
  the apophysis functional stomata, similar to those of the higher plants,
  are present and, since cells containing chlorophyll are present below the
  superficial layers of the apophysis and capsule, the sporogonium is
  capable of independent assimilation. The construction of the capsule will
  be best understood from the median longitudinal section (fig. 11, C). The
  central region extending between the apophysis and the operculum is
  composed of sterile tissue and forms the columella (<i>c</i>).
  Immediately around this is the layer of cells from which the spores will
  be developed (<i>s</i>), and the layers of cells on either side of this
  form the walls of the spore-sac, which will contain the spores. Between
  the wall of the capsule, which is composed of several layers of cells,
  and the spore-sac is a wide intercellular space (<i>h</i>) bridged across
  by trabeculae consisting of rows of chlorophyll-containing cells. At the
  junction of the operculum (<i>d</i>) with the rest of the capsule is a
  circle of cells forming the annulus (<i>a</i>), by help of which the
  operculum is detached at maturity as a small lid. Its removal does not,
  however, leave the mouth of the capsule wide open, for around the margin
  are two circles of pointed teeth forming the peristome. These are the
  thickened cell-walls of a definite layer of cells (<i>p</i>), and appear
  <!-- Page 706 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page706"></a>[v.04
  p.0706]</span>as separate teeth owing to the breaking down of the
  unthickened cell-walls. The numerous spores which have been developed in
  the spore sac can thus only escape from the pendulous capsule through
  narrow slits between the teeth, and these are closed in damp air. The
  unicellular spores when supplied with moisture germinate (fig. 12) and
  give rise to the sexual generation. A filamentous protonema is first
  developed, some of the branches of which are exposed to the light and
  contain abundant chlorophyll, while others penetrate the substratum as
  brown or colourless rhizoids. The moss-plants arise from single
  projecting cells, and numerous plants may spring from the protonema
  developed from a single spore.</p>

  not extend to the upper end of the capsule, and the latter opens by a
  number of lateral slits. The Sphagnales also have a dome-shaped spore-sac
  continued over the columella, and, though their capsule opens by an
  operculum, they differ widely from other mosses in the development of the
  sporogonium as well as in the characters of the sexual generation. The
  three groups are described separately below, but some more general
  features of the mosses may be considered here.</p>

  <p>On the whole mosses grow in drier situations than the liverworts, and
  the arrangements they present for the conduction of water in the plant
  are also more complete and suggest in some cases comparisons with the
  higher plants. In spite of this, however, they are in great part
  dependent on the absorption of water through the general surface of the
  shoot, and the power of rapid imbibition possessed by their cell-walls,
  the crowded position of the small leaves on the stem, and special
  adaptations for the retention of water on the surface, have the same
  significance as in the foliose liverworts. The different appearance of
  exposed mosses in dry weather and after a shower illustrates this
  relation to the water supply. The protonema is always a well-marked stage
  in the life-history. Not only does a moss-plant never arise directly from
  the spore, but in all cases of vegetative reproduction, apart from the
  separation of branches by decay of older regions of the plant, a
  protonema is found. Usually the protonema is filamentous and ceases to be
  evident after the plants have developed. But in some small mosses (e.g.
  <i>Ephemerum</i>) it plays the chief part in assimilation and lives on
  from year to year. In <i>Sphagnum</i>, <i>Andreaea</i> and some genera of
  the Bryales the protonema or some of its branches have the form of flat
  plates or masses of cells. The formation of the moss-plant on the
  protonema is always from a single cell and is similar in all mosses. The
  first three walls in this cell intersect one another, and define the
  three-sided pyramidal apical cell by means of which the shoot continues
  to grow. In <i>Fissidens</i> and a few other mosses the apical cell is
  two-sided. The leaves formed by the successive segments gradually attain
  their normal size and structure. Each segment of the initial cell gives
  rise to a leaf and a portion of the stem; the branches arise from the
  lower portion of a segment and stand immediately below a leaf. The leaves
  may form three vertical rows, but usually their arrangement, owing to the
  direction of the segment walls at the apex, becomes more complicated.
  Their growth proceeds by means of a two-sided apical cell, and the midrib
  does not become more than one cell thick until later. In addition to the
  leaves the stem often bears hair-like structures of different kinds, some
  of which correspond to modified branches of protonema. The branched
  filamentous rhizoids which spring from the lower region of the stem also
  correspond to protonemal branches. The structure of both stem and leaf
  reaches a high grade of organization in some mosses. Not only are
  thick-walled sclerenchymatous cells developed to give rigidity to the
  periphery of the stem and the midrib of the leaf, but in many cases a
  special water-conducting tissue, consisting of elongated cells, the end
  walls of which are thin and oblique, forms a definite central strand in
  the stem. In the forms in which it is most highly developed
  (Polytrichaceae) this tissue, which is comparable with the xylem of
  higher plants, is surrounded by a zone of tissue physiologically
  comparable to phloem, and in the rhizome may be limited by an endodermis.
  The conducting strands in the leaves show the same tissues as in the
  central strand of the stem, and in the Polytrichaceae and some other
  mosses are in continuity with it. The independent origin of this
  conducting system is of great interest for comparison with the vascular
  system of the sporophyte of the higher plants.</p>

  <p>The sexual organs, with the exception of the antheridia of
  <i>Sphagnum</i>, are borne at the apices of the main shoot or of
  branches. Their general similarity to the mature antheridia and
  archegonia of liverworts and the main difference in their development
  have been referred to. The antheridia open by means of a cap cell or
  groups of cells with mucilaginous contents. The details of construction
  of the sporogonium are referred to below. In all cases (except
  <i>Archidium</i>) a columella is present, and all the cells derived from
  the archesporium produce spores, no elaters being formed. In a few cases
  the germination of the spore commences within the capsule. The
  development of the sporogonium proceeds in all cases (except in
  <i>Sphagnum</i>) by means of an apical cell cutting off two rows of
  segments. The first periclinal division in the region forming the capsule
  separates an inner group of cells (the endothecium) form the peripheral
  layer (amphithecium). In <i>Sphagnum</i>, as in <i>Anthoceros</i>, the
  archesporium is derived from the amphithecium; in all other mosses it is
  the outermost layer of the endothecium.</p>

  <p>Vegetative propagation is widely spread in the mosses, and, as
  mentioned above, a protonema is always formed in the development of the
  new plant. The social growth of the plants characteristic of many mosses
  is a result of the formation of numerous plants on the original protonema
  and on developments from the rhizoids. Besides this, gemmae may be formed
  on the protonema, on the leaves or at the apex, and some mosses have
  specialized shoots for their better protection or distribution. Thus in
  <i>Georgia</i> the stalked, multicellular gemmae are borne at the ends of
  shoots surrounded by a rosette of larger leaves, and in <i>Aulacomnium
  androgynum</i> they are raised on an elongated leafless region of the
  shoot. In other cases detached leaves or shoots may give rise to new
  plants, and when a moss is artificially divided almost any fragment may
  serve for reproduction.</p>

  <p>Even in those rare cases in which the sexual generation can be
  developed without the intervention of spore production from the tissues
  of the sporogonium, a protonema is formed from cut pieces of the seta or
  in some cases from intact sporogonia still attached to the plant. This
  phenomenon of <i>apospory</i> was first discovered in mosses, but is now
  also known in a number of ferns (see <span
  class="sc">Pteridophyta</span>).</p>

  <p><i>Sphagnales.</i>&mdash;The single genus <i>Sphagnum</i> occupies a
  very distinct and isolated position among mosses. The numerous species,
  which are familiar as the bog-mosses, are so similar that minute
  structural characters have to be relied on in their identification. The
  plants occur in large patches of a pale green or reddish colour on moors,
  and, when filling up small lakes or pools, may attain a length of some
  feet. Their growth has played a large part in the formation of peat. The
  species are distributed in temperate and arctic climates, but in the
  tropics only occur at high levels. The protonema forms a flat, lobed,
  thalloid structure attached to the soil by rhizoids, and the plants arise
  from marginal cells. The main shoot bears numerous branches which appear
  to stand in whorls; some of them bend down and become applied to the
  surface of the main axis. The structure of the stem and leaves is
  peculiar. The former shows on cross-section a thin-walled central tissue
  surrounded by a zone of thick-walled cells. Outside this come one to five
  layers of large clear cells, which when mature are dead and empty; their
  walls are strengthened with a spiral thickening and perforated with round
  pores. They serve to absorb and conduct water by capillarity. The leaves
  have no midrib and similar empty cells occur regularly among the narrow
  chlorophyll-containing cells, which thus appear as a green network. The
  antheridia are globular and have long stalks. They stand by the side of
  leaves of special club-shaped branches. The archegonial groups occupy the
  apices of short branches (fig. 13, A.). The mature sporogonium consists
  of a wide foot separated by a constriction from the globular capsule (B).
  There is no distinct seta, but the capsule is raised on a leafless
  outgrowth of the end of the branch called a pseudopodium (C, <i>qs</i>).
  The capsule, the wall of which bears rudimentary stomata, has a small
  operculum but no peristome. There is a short, wide columella, over which
  the dome-shaped spore-sac extends, and no air-space is present between
  the spore-sac and the wall. In the embryo a number of tiers of cells are
  first formed. The lower tiers <!-- Page 707 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page707"></a>[v.04 p.0707]</span>form the foot, while in the upper
  part the first divisions mark off the columella, around which the
  archesporium, derived from the amphithecium, extends. The sporogonium
  when nearly mature bursts the calyptra irregularly. The capsule opens
  explosively in dry weather, the operculum and spores being thrown to a
  distance. The spore on germination forms a short filament which soon
  broadens out into the thalloid protonema. Some twelve species of
  <i>Sphagnum</i> are found in Britain.</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>Andreaeales.</i>&mdash;The species of the single genus
  <i>Andreaea</i> (fig. 14) are small, dark-coloured mosses growing for the
  most part in tufts on bare rocks in alpine and arctic regions. Four
  species occur on alpine rocks in Britain. The spore on germination gives
  rise to a small mass of cells from which one or more short filaments
  grow. The filament soon broadens into a ribbon-shaped thallus, several
  cells thick, which is closely applied to the rock. Erect branches may
  arise from the protonema, and gemmae may be developed on it. The stem of
  the plant, which arises in the usual way, has no conducting strand and
  the leaves may or may not have midribs. The leaf grows by a dome-shaped
  instead of by the usual two-sided initial cell. The antheridia are
  long-stalked. The upper portion of the archegonial wall is carried up as
  a calyptra on the sporogonium, which, as in <i>Sphagnum</i>, has no seta
  and is raised on a pseudopodium. The development of the sporogonium
  proceeds as in the Bryales, but the dome-shaped archesporium extends over
  the summit of the columella and an air-space is wanting. The capsule does
  not open by an operculum but by four or six longitudinal slits, which do
  not reach either the base or apex. In one exotic species the splits occur
  only at the upper part of the capsule, and the terminal cap breaks away.
  This isolated example thus appears to approach the Bryales in its mode of
  dehiscence.</p>

  <p><i>Bryales.</i>&mdash;In contrast to the preceding two this group
  includes a very large number of genera and species. Thus even in Britain
  between five and six hundred species belonging to more than one hundred
  genera are found. They occur in the most varied situations, on soil, on
  rocks and trees, and, in a few instances (<i>Fontinalis</i>), in water.
  Although exhibiting a wide range in size and in the structural complexity
  of both generations, they all conform to a general type, so that
  <i>Funaria</i>, described above, will serve as a fair example of the
  group. The protonema is usually filamentous, and in some of the simplest
  forms is long-lived, while the small plants borne on it serve mainly to
  protect the sexual organs and sporogonia. This is the case in
  <i>Ephemerum</i>, which grows on the damp soil of clayey fields, and the
  plants are even more simply constructed in <i>Buxbaumia</i>, which occurs
  on soil rich in humus and is possibly partially saprophytic. In this moss
  the filamentous protonema is capable of assimilation, but the leaves of
  the small plants are destitute of chlorophyll, so that they are dependent
  on the protonema. The male plant has no definite stem, and consists of a
  single concave leaf protecting the antheridium. The female plant is
  rather more highly organized, consisting of a short stem bearing a few
  leaves around the group of archegonia. The sporogonium is of large size
  and highly organized, though it presents peculiar features in the
  peristome. <i>Buxbaumia</i> has been regarded by Goebel as representing a
  stage which other mosses have passed, and has been described by him as
  the simplest type of moss. In <i>Ephemerum</i> also we may probably
  regard the relation of the small plants to the protonema as a primitive
  one. On the other hand, in the case of <i>Ephemeropsis</i>, which grows
  on the leaves of living plants in Java, the high organization of the
  sporogonium makes it probable that the persistent protonema is an
  adaptation to the peculiar conditions of life. A highly developed
  protonema provided with leaf-like assimilating organs is found in
  <i>Georgia</i>, <i>Diphyscium</i> and <i>Oedipodium</i>, all of which
  show peculiarities in the sporogonium as well. The cells of the protonema
  of <i>Schistostega</i>, which lives in the shade of caves, are so
  constructed as to concentrate the feeble available light on the
  chloroplasts.</p>

  <p>We may perhaps regard the persistent protonema bearing small leafy
  plants as a primitive condition, and look upon those larger plants which
  remain unbranched and bear the sexual organs at the apex (e.g.
  <i>Schistostega</i>) as representing the next stage. From this condition
  different lines of specialization in the form and structure of the plant
  can be recognized. A large number of mosses stand at about the same grade
  as <i>Funaria</i>, in that the plants are small, sparingly branched,
  usually radial, and do not show a very highly differentiated internal
  structure. In others the form of the plant becomes more complex by
  copious branching and the differentiation of shoots of different orders.
  In these cases the shoot system is often more or less dorsiventral, and
  the sexual organs are borne on short lateral branches (e.g. <i>Thuidium
  tamariscinum</i>). The Polytrichaceae, on the other hand, show a
  specialization in structure rather than in form. The high organization of
  their conducting system has been referred to above, but though many
  species are able to exist in relatively dry situations, the plants are
  still dependent on the absorption of water by the general surface. The
  parallel lamellae of assimilating cells which grow from the upper surface
  of the leaf in these and some other mosses probably serve to retain water
  in the neighbourhood of the assimilating cells and so prolong their
  activity. As common adaptive features in the leaves the occurrence of
  papillae or outgrowths of the cell-walls to retain water, and the white
  hairlike leaf tips, which assist in protecting the young parts at the
  apex of many xerophytic mosses, may be mentioned. The leaves of
  <i>Leucobryum</i>, which occurs in pale green tufts in shaded woods, show
  a parallel adaptation to that found in <i>Sphagnum</i>. They are several
  cells thick, and the small assimilating cells lie between two layers of
  empty water-storage cells, the walls of which are perforated by
  pores.</p>

  <p>With the possible exception of <i>Archidium</i>, the sporogonium is
  throughout the Bryales constructed on one plan. <i>Archidium</i> is a
  small moss occurring occasionally on the soil of wet fields. The
  protonema is not persistent, and the plants are well developed,
  resembling those of <i>Pleuridium</i>. The sporogonium has a small foot
  and practically no seta, and differs in the development and structure of
  its capsule from all other mosses. The spores are derived from the
  endothecium, but no distinction of a sterile columella and an
  archesporium is established in this, a variable number of its cells
  becoming spore-mother-cells while the rest serve to nourish the spores.
  The layer of cells immediately around the endothecium becomes the
  spore-sac, and an air-space forms between this and the wall of the
  capsule. The very large, thin-walled spores escape on the decay of the
  capsule, which ruptures the archegonial wall irregularly. On account of
  the absence of a columella <i>Archidium</i> is sometimes placed in a
  distinct group, but since its peculiarities have possibly arisen by
  reduction it seems at present best retained among the Bryales. In all
  other Bryales there is a definite columella extending from the base to
  the apex of the capsule, the archesporium is derived from the outermost
  layer of cells of the endothecium, and an air space is formed between the
  spore-sac and the wall. In the Polytrichaceae another air space separates
  the spore-sac from the columella. There is great variety in the length of
  the seta, which is sometimes practically absent. The apophysis, which may
  be a more or less distinct region, usually bears stomata and is the main
  organ of assimilation. In the Splachnaceae it is expanded for this
  purpose, while in <i>Oedipodium</i> it constitutes most of the long pale
  stalk which supports the capsule. A distinct operculum is usually
  detached by the help of the annulus, and its removal may leave the mouth
  of the capsule widely open. More usually there is a peristome, consisting
  of one or two series of teeth, which serves to narrow the opening and in
  various ways to ensure the gradual shedding of the spores in dry weather.
  In most mosses the teeth are portions of thickened cell-walls but in the
  Polytrichaceae they are formed of a number of sclerenchymatous cells. In
  <i>Polytrichum</i> a membranous epiphragm stretches across the wide mouth
  of the capsule between the tips of the short peristome teeth, and closes
  the opening except for the interspaces of the peristome.</p>

  <p>In a number of forms, which were formerly grouped together, the
  capsule does not open to liberate the spores. These cleistocarpous forms
  are now recognized as related to various natural groups, in which the
  majority of the species possess an operculum. In such forms as
  <i>Phascum</i> the columella persists, and the only peculiarity is in the
  absence of arrangements for dehiscence. In <i>Ephemerum</i> <!-- Page 708
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page708"></a>[v.04 p.0708]</span>(and
  the closely related <i>Nanomitrium</i> which has a small operculum) the
  columella becomes absorbed during the development of the spores. Stomata
  are present on the wall of the small capsule. Such facts as these suggest
  that in many cases the cleistocarpous condition is the result of
  reduction rather than primitive, and that possibly the same holds for
  <i>Archidium</i>.</p>

  <p>The former subdivision of the Bryales into Musci Cleistocarpi and
  Musci Stegocarpi according to the absence or presence of an operculum is
  thus clearly artificial. The same holds even more obviously for the
  grouping of the stegocarpous forms into those in which the archegonial
  group terminates a main axis (acrocarpi) and those in which it is borne
  on a more or less developed lateral branch (pleurocarpi). Modern
  classifications of the Bryales depend mainly on the construction of the
  peristome.</p>

  <p>It remains to be considered to what extent the several natural groups
  of plants classed together in the Bryophyta can be placed in a
  phylogenetic relation to one another. Practically no help is afforded by
  palaeobotany, and only the comparison of existing forms can be depended
  on. The indications of probable lines of evolution are clearest in the
  Hepaticae. The Marchantiales form an obviously natural evolutionary
  group, and the same is probably true of the Jungermanniales, although in
  neither case can the partial lines of progression within the main groups
  be said to be quite clear. Such a form as <i>Sphaerocarpus</i>, which has
  features in common with the lower Marchantiales, enables us to form an
  idea of the divergence of the two groups from a common ancestry. The
  Anthocerotales, on the other hand, stand in an isolated position, and
  recent researches have served to emphasize this rather than to confirm
  the relationship with the Jungermanniales suggested by Leitgeb. The
  indications of a serial progression are not so clear in the mosses, but
  the majority of the forms may be regarded as forming a great phylogenetic
  group in the evolution of which the elaboration of the moss-plant has
  proceeded until the protonema appears as a mere preliminary stage to the
  formation of the plants. Parallel with the evolution of the gametophyte
  in form and structure, a progression can be traced in the sporogonium,
  although the simplest sporogonia available for study may owe much of
  their simplicity to reduction. The Andreaeales may perhaps be looked on
  as a divergent primitive branch of the same stock. On the other hand, the
  Sphagnales show such considerable and important differences from the rest
  of the mosses, that like the Anthocerotales among the liverworts, they
  may be regarded as a group, the relationship of which to the main stem is
  at least problematical. Between the Hepaticae, Anthocerotales, Sphagnales
  and Musci, there are no connecting forms known, and it must be left as an
  open question whether the Bryophyta are a monophyletic or polyphyletic
  group.</p>

  <p>The question of the relationship of the Bryophyta on the one hand to
  the Thallophyta and on the other to the Pteridophyta lies even more in
  the region of speculation, on slender grounds without much hope of
  decisive evidence. In a general sense we may regard the Bryophyta as
  derived from an algal ancestry, without being able to suggest the nature
  of the ancestral forms or the geological period at which they arose.
  Recent researches on those Algae such as <i>Coleochaete</i> which
  appeared to afford a close comparison in their alternation of generations
  with <i>Riccia</i>, have shown that the body resulting from the
  segmentation of the fertilized ovum is not so strictly comparable in the
  two cases as had been supposed. The series of increasingly complex
  sporogonia among Bryophytes appears to be most naturally explained on an
  hypothesis of progressive sterilization of sporogenous tissue, such as
  has been advanced by Bower. On the other hand there are not wanting
  indications of reduction in the Bryophyte sporogonium which make an
  alternative view of its origin at least possible. With regard to the
  relationship of the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta the article on the latter
  group should be consulted. It will be sufficient to say in conclusion
  that while the alternating generations in the two groups are strictly
  comparable, no evidence of actual relationship is yet forthcoming.</p>

  later name, P-ubasti, "place of Ubasti"; thus the goddess derived her
  name Ubasti from her city (Bast), and in turn the city derived its name
  P-ubasti from that of the goddess; the Greeks, confusing the name of the
  city with that of the goddess, called the latter Bubastis, and the former
  also Bubastis (later Bubastos). Bubastis, capital of the 19th nome of
  Lower Egypt, is now represented by a great mound of ruins called Tell
  Basta, near Zagazig, including the site of a large temple (described by
  Herodotus) strewn with blocks of granite. The monuments discovered there,
  although only those in hard stone have survived, are more important than
  at any other site in the Delta except Tanis and cover a wider range,
  commencing with Khufu (Cheops) and continuing to the thirtieth
  dynasty.</p>

  <p>Ubasti was one of many feline goddesses, figured with the head of a
  lioness. In the great development of reverence for sacred animals which
  took place after the New Kingdom, the domestic cat was especially the
  animal of Bubastis, although it had also to serve for all the other
  feline goddesses, owing no doubt to the scarcity and intractability of
  its congeners. Her hieratic and most general form was still
  lioness-headed, but a popular form, especially in bronze, was a
  cat-headed women, often holding in her right hand a lion aegis, i.e. a
  broad semicircular pectoral surmounted by the head of a lioness, and on
  the left arm a basket. The cat cemetery on the west side of the town
  consisted of numbers of large brick chambers, crammed with burnt and
  decayed mummies, many of which had been enclosed in cat-shaped cases of
  wood and bronze. Herodotus describes the festival of Bubastis, which was
  attended by thousands from all parts of Egypt and was a very riotous
  affair; it has its modern equivalent in the Moslem festival of the sheikh
  Said el Badawi at Tanta. The tablet of Canopus shows that there were two
  festivals of Bubastis, the great and the lesser: perhaps the lesser
  festival was held at Memphis, where the quarter called Ankhto contained a
  temple to this goddess. Her name is found on monuments from the third
  dynasty onwards, but a great stimulus was given to her worship by the
  twenty-second (Bubastite) dynasty and generally by the increased
  importance of Lower Egypt in later times. Her character seems to have
  been essentially mild and playful, in contrast to Sokhmi and other feline
  goddesses. The Greeks equated Ubasti with their Artemis, confusing her
  with the leonine Tafne, sister of Shöou (Apollo). The Egyptians
  themselves delighted in identifying together goddesses of the most
  diverse forms and attributes; but Ubasti was almost indistinguishable in
  form from Tafne. The name of her son Iphthimis (Nfr-tm), pronounced
  Eftem, may mean "All-good," and, in the absence of other information
  about him, suggests a reason why he was identified with Prometheus.</p>

  <p><b>BUCCANEERS,</b> the name given to piratical adventurers of
  different nationalities united in their opposition to Spain, who
  maintained themselves chiefly in the Caribbean Sea during the 17th
  century.</p>

  <p>The island of Santo Domingo was one of several in the West Indies
  which had early in the 16th century been almost depopulated by the
  oppressive colonial policy of Spain. Along its coast there were several
  isolated establishments presided over by Spaniards, who were deprived of
  a convenient market for the produce of the soil by the monopolies imposed
  by the mother country. Accordingly English, Dutch and French vessels were
  welcomed and their cargoes readily bought. The island, thinned of its
  former inhabitants, had become the home of immense herds of wild cattle;
  and it became the habit of smugglers to provision at Santo Domingo. The
  natives still left were skilled in preserving flesh at their little
  establishments called <i>boucans</i>. The adventurers learned
  "boucanning" from the natives; and gradually Hispaniola became the scene
  of an extensive and illicit butcher trade. Spanish monopolies filled the
  seamen who sailed the Caribbean with a natural hate of everything
  Spanish. The pleasures of a roving life, enlivened by occasional
  skirmishes with forces organized and led by Spanish officials, gained
  upon them. Out of such conditions arose the buccaneer, alternately sailor
  and hunter, even occasionally a planter&mdash;roving, bold, unscrupulous,
  often savage, with an intense detestation of Spain. As the Spaniards
  would not recognize the right of other races to make settlements, or even
  to trade in the West Indies, the governments of France, England and
  Holland would do nothing to control their subjects who invaded the
  islands. They left them free to make settlements at their own risk. Each
  nation contributed a band of colonists, who selected the island of St
  Kitts or St Christopher, in the West Indies, where the settlers of both
  nations were simultaneously planted. The English and French were,
  however, not very friendly; and in 1629, after the retirement of several
  of the former to an adjoining island, the remaining colonists were
  surprised and partly dispersed by the arrival of a Spanish fleet of
  thirty-nine sail. But on the departure of the fleet the scattered bands
  returned, and encouragement was given to their countrymen in Santo
  Domingo. For buccaneering had now become a most profitable employment,
  operations were extended, and a storehouse secure from the attacks of the
  Spaniards was required. The small island of Tortuga (north-west of
  Hispaniola) was seized for this purpose in 1630, converted into a
  magazine for the goods of the rivals, and made their headquarters, Santo
  Domingo itself still continuing their hunting ground. A purely English
  settlement directed by a company in London was made at Old Providence, an
  island in the Caribbean Sea, now belonging to Colombia. It began a little
  before 1630, and was suppressed by the Spaniards in 1641.</p>

  <p>Spain was unable to take immediate action. Eight years later, however,
  watching their opportunity when many buccaneers were absent in the larger
  island, the Spaniards attacked Tortuga, and massacred every settler they
  could seize. But the others returned; and the buccaneers, now in open
  hostility to the Spanish arms, began to receive recruits from every
  European trading nation, and for three-quarters of a century became the
  scourge of the Spanish-American trade and dominions.</p>

  <p>France, throughout all this, had not been idle. She had named the
  governor of St Kitts "Governor-General for the French West India
  Islands," and in 1641 he took possession of Tortuga, expelled all English
  from the island, and attempted the same with less success in Santo
  Domingo. England was absorbed in the Civil War, and the buccaneers had to
  maintain themselves as best they could,&mdash;now mainly on the sea.</p>

  <p>In 1654 the Spaniards regained Tortuga from the French, into whose
  hands it again, however, fell after six years. But this state of affairs
  was too insecure even for these rovers, and they would speedily have
  succumbed had not a refuge been found for them by the fortunate conquest
  of Jamaica in 1655 by the navy of the English Commonwealth. These
  conquests were not made without the aid of the buccaneers themselves. The
  taking and re-taking of Tortuga by the French was always with the
  assistance of the roving community; and at the conquest of Jamaica the
  English navy had the same influence in its favour. The <!-- Page 710
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page710"></a>[v.04
  p.0710]</span>buccaneers, in fact, constituted a mercenary navy, ready
  for employment against the power of Spain by any other nation, on
  condition of sharing the plunder; and they were noted for their daring,
  their cruelty and their extraordinary skill in seamanship.</p>

  <p>Their history now divides itself into three epochs. The first of these
  extends from the period of their rise to the capture of Panama by Morgan
  in 1671, during which time they were hampered neither by government aid
  nor, till near its close, by government restriction. The second, from
  1671 to the time of their greatest power, 1685, when the scene of their
  operations was no longer merely the Caribbean, but principally the whole
  range of the Pacific from California to Chile. The third and last period
  extends from that year onwards; it was a time of disunion and
  disintegration, when the independence and rude honour of the previous
  periods had degenerated into unmitigated vice and brutality.</p>

  <p>It is chiefly during the first period that those leaders flourished
  whose names and doings have been associated with all that was really
  influential in the exploits of the buccaneers&mdash;the most prominent
  being Mansfield and Morgan. The floating commerce of Spain had by the
  middle of the 17th century become utterly insignificant. But Spanish
  settlements remained; and in 1654 the first great expedition on land made
  by the buccaneers, though attended by considerable difficulties, was
  completed by the capture and sack of New Segovia, on the mainland of
  America. The Gulf of Venezuela, with its towns of Maracaibo and
  Gibraltar, were attacked and plundered under the command of a Frenchman
  named L'Ollonois, who performed, it is said, the office of executioner
  upon the whole crew of a Spanish vessel manned with ninety seamen. Such
  successes removed the buccaneers further and further from the pale of
  civilized society, fed their revenge, and inspired them with an avarice
  almost equal to that of the original settlers from Spain. Mansfield
  indeed, in 1664, conceived the idea of a permanent settlement upon a
  small island of the Bahamas, named New Providence, and Henry Morgan, a
  Welshman, intrepid and unscrupulous, joined him. But the untimely death
  of Mansfield nipped in the bud the only rational scheme of settlement
  which seems at any time to have animated this wild community; and Morgan,
  now elected commander, swept the whole Caribbean, and from his
  headquarters in Jamaica led triumphant expeditions to Cuba and the
  mainland. He was leader of the expedition wherein Porto Bello, one of the
  best-fortified ports in the West Indies, was surprised and plundered.</p>

  <p>This was too much for even the adverse European powers; and in 1670 a
  treaty was concluded between England and Spain, proclaiming peace and
  friendship among the subjects of the two sovereigns in the New World,
  formally renouncing hostilities of every kind. Great Britain was to hold
  all her possessions in the New World as her own property (a remarkable
  concession on the part of Spain), and consented, on behalf of her
  subjects, to forbear trading with any Spanish port without licence
  obtained.</p>

  <p>The treaty was very ill observed in Jamaica, where the governor,
  Thomas Modyford (1620-1679), was in close alliance with the "privateers,"
  which was the official title of the buccaneers. He had already granted
  commissions to Morgan and others for a great attack on the Isthmus of
  Panama, the route by which the bullion of the South American mines was
  carried to Porto Bello, to be shipped to Spain. The buccaneers to the
  number of 2000 began by seizing Chagres, and then marched to Panama in
  1671. After a difficult journey on foot and in canoes, they found
  themselves nearing the shores of the South Sea and in view of the city.
  On the morning of the tenth day they commenced an engagement which ended
  in the rout of the defenders of the town. It was taken, and, accidentally
  or not, it was burnt. The sack of Panama was accompanied by great
  barbarities. The Spaniards had, however, removed the treasure before the
  city was taken. When the booty was divided, Morgan is accused of having
  defrauded his followers. It is certain that the share per man was small,
  and that many of the buccaneers died of starvation while trying to return
  to Jamaica. Modyford was recalled, and in 1672 Morgan was called home and
  imprisoned in the Tower. In 1674 he was allowed to come back to the
  island as lieutenant-governor with Lord Vaughan. He had become so
  unpopular after the expedition of 1671 that he was followed in the
  streets and threatened by the relations of those who had perished. During
  his later years he was active in suppressing the buccaneers who had now
  inconvenient claims on him.</p>

  <p>From 1671 to 1685 is the time of the greatest daring, prosperity and
  power of the buccaneers. The expedition against Panama had not been
  without its influence. Notwithstanding their many successes in the
  Caribbean and on land, including a second plunder of Porto Bello, their
  thoughts ran frequently on the great expedition across the isthmus, and
  they pictured the South Sea as a far wider and more lucrative field for
  the display of their united power.</p>

  <p>In 1680 a body of marauders over 300 strong, well armed and
  provisioned, landed on the shore of Darien and struck across the country;
  and the cruelty and mismanagement displayed in the policy of the
  Spaniards towards the Indians were now revenged by the assistance which
  the natives eagerly rendered to the adventurers. They acted as guides
  during a difficult journey of nine days, kept the invaders well supplied
  with food, provided them with canoes, and only left them after the taking
  of the fort of Santa Maria, when the buccaneers were fairly embarked on a
  broad and safe river which emptied itself into the South Sea. With John
  Coxon as commander they entered the Bay of Panama, where rumour had been
  before them, and where the Spaniards had hastily prepared a small fleet
  to meet them. But the valour of the buccaneers won for them another
  victory; within a week they took possession of four Spanish ships, and
  now successes flowed upon them. The Pacific, hitherto free from their
  intrusion, showed many sail of merchant vessels, while on land opposition
  south of the Bay of Panama was of little avail, since few were acquainted
  with the use of fire-arms. Coxon and seventy men returned as they had
  gone, but the others, under Sawkins, Sharp and Watling, roamed north and
  south on islands and mainland, and remained for long ravaging the coast
  of Peru. Never short of silver and gold, but often in want of the
  necessaries of life, they continued their practices for a little longer;
  then, evading the risk of recrossing the isthmus, they boldly cleared
  Cape Horn, and arrived in the Indies. Again, in 1683, numbers of them
  under John Cook departed for the South Sea by way of Cape Horn. On Cook's
  death his successor, Edward Davis, undoubtedly the greatest and most
  prudent commander who ever led the forces of the buccaneers at sea, met
  with a certain Captain Swan from England, and the two captains began a
  cruise which was disastrous to the Spanish trade in the Pacific.</p>

  <p>In 1685 they were joined in the Bay of Panama by large numbers of
  buccaneers who had crossed the isthmus under Townley and others. This
  increased body of men required an enlarged measure of adventure, and this
  in a few months was supplied by the viceroy of Peru. That officer, seeing
  the trade of the colony cut off, supplies stopped, towns burned and
  raided, and property harassed by continual raids, resolved by vigorous
  means to put an end to it. But his aim was not easily accomplished. In
  this same year a Spanish fleet of fourteen sail met, but did not engage,
  ten buccaneer vessels which were found in the Bay of Panama.</p>

  <p>At this period the power of the buccaneers was at its height. But the
  combination was too extensive for its work, and the different nationality
  of those who composed it was a source of growing discord. Nor was the
  dream of equality ever realized for any length of time. The immense spoil
  obtained on the capture of wealthy cities was indeed divided equally. But
  in the gambling and debauchery which followed, nothing was more common
  than that one-half of the conquerors should find themselves on the morrow
  in most pressing want; and while those who had retained or increased
  their share would willingly have gone home, the others clamoured for
  renewed attacks. The separation of the English and French buccaneers, who
  together presented a united front to the Spanish fleet in 1685, marks the
  beginning of the third and last epoch in their history.</p>

  <p>The brilliant exploits begun by the sack of Leon and Realejo <!-- Page
  711 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page711"></a>[v.04 p.0711]</span>by
  the English under Davis have, even in their variety and daring, a
  sameness which deprives them of interest, and the wonderful confederacy
  is now seen to be falling gradually to pieces. The skill of Davis at sea
  was on one occasion displayed in a seven days' engagement with two large
  Spanish vessels, and the interest undoubtedly centres in him. Townley and
  Swan had, however, by this time left him, and after cruising together for
  some time, they, too, parted. In 1688 Davis cleared Cape Horn and arrived
  in the West Indies, while Swan's ship, the "Cygnet," was abandoned as
  unseaworthy, after sailing as far as Madagascar. Townley had hardly
  joined the French buccaneers remaining in the South Sea ere he died, and
  the Frenchmen with their companions crossed New Spain to the West Indies.
  And thus the Pacific, ravaged so long by this powerful and mysterious
  band of corsairs, was at length at peace.</p>

  <p>The West Indies had by this time become hot enough even for the banded
  pirates. They hung doggedly along the coasts of Jamaica and Santo
  Domingo, but their day was nearly over. Only once again&mdash;at the
  siege of Carthagena&mdash;did they appear great; but even then the
  expedition was not of their making, and they were mere auxiliaries of the
  French regular forces. After the treachery of the French commander of
  this expedition a spirit of unity and despairing energy seemed reawakened
  in them; but this could not avert and scarcely delayed the rapidly
  approaching extinction of the community.</p>

  <p>The French and English buccaneers could not but take sides in the war
  which had arisen between their respective countries in 1689. Thus was
  broken the bond of unity which had for three-quarters of a century kept
  the subjects of the two nations together in schemes of aggression upon a
  common foe. In the short peace of 1697-1700 England and France were using
  all their influence, both in the Old World and in the New, to ingratiate
  themselves into the favour of the king of Spain. With the resumption of
  hostilities in 1700 and the rise of Spain consequent upon the accession
  of the French claimant to the throne the career of the buccaneers was
  effectually closed.</p>

  <p>But the fall of the buccaneers is no more accounted for fully by these
  circumstances than is their rise by the massacre of the islanders of
  Santo Domingo. There was that in the very nature of the community which,
  from its birth, marked it as liable to speedy decline.</p>

  <p>The principles which bound the buccaneers together were, first the
  desire for adventure and gain, and, in the second place, hatred of the
  Spaniard. The first was hardly a sufficient bond of union, among men of
  different nationalities, when booty could be had nearly always by private
  venture under the colours of the separate European powers. Of greater
  validity was their second and great principle of union, namely, that they
  warred not with one another, nor with every one, but with a single and a
  common foe. For while the buccaneer forces included English, French and
  Dutch sailors, and were complemented occasionally by bands of native
  Indians, there are few instances during the time of their prosperity and
  growth of their falling upon one another, and treating their fellows with
  the savagery which they exulted in displaying against the subjects of
  Spain. The exigencies, moreover, of their perilous career readily wasted
  their suddenly acquired gains.</p>

  <p>Settled labour, the warrant of real wealth, was unacceptable to those
  who lived by promoting its insecurity. Regular trade&mdash;though
  rendered attractive by smuggling&mdash;and pearl gathering and similar
  operations which were spiced with risk, were open in vain to them, and in
  the absence of any domestic life, a hand-to-mouth system of supply and
  demand rooted out gradually the prudence which accompanies any mode of
  settled existence. In everything the policy of the buccaneers, from the
  beginning to the end of their career, was one of pure destruction, and
  was, therefore, ultimately suicidal.</p>

  <p>Their great importance in history lies in the fact that they opened
  the eyes of the world, and specially of the nations from whom these
  buccaneers had sprung, to the whole system of Spanish-American government
  and commerce&mdash;the former in its rottenness, and the latter in its
  possibilities in other hands. From this, then, along with other causes,
  dating primarily from the helplessness and presumption of Spain, there
  arose the West Indian possessions of Holland, England and France.</p>

  <p>A work published at Amsterdam in 1678, entitled <i>De Americaensche
  Zee Roovers</i>, from the pen of a buccaneer named Exquemelin, was
  translated into several European languages, receiving additions at the
  hands of the different translators. The French translation by
  Frontignières is named <i>Histoire des avanturiers qui se sont signalez
  dans les Indes</i>; the English edition is entitled <i>The Bucaniers of
  America.</i> Other works are Raynal's <i>History of the Settlements and
  Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies</i>, book x., English
  translation 1782; Dampier's <i>Voyages</i>; Geo. W. Thornbury's
  <i>Monarchs of the Main, &amp;c.</i> (1855); Lionel Wafer's <i>Voyage and
  Description of the Isthmus of America</i> (1699); and the <i>Histoire de
  l'isle Espagnole, &amp;c.</i>, and <i>Histoire et description générale de
  la Nouvelle France</i> of Père Charlevoix. The statements in these works
  are to be received with caution. A really authentic narrative, however,
  is Captain James Burney's <i>History of the Buccaneers of America</i>
  (London, 1816). The <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, Colonial Series
  (London, 1860 et seq.), contains much evidence for the history of the
  buccaneers in the West Indies.</p>

  The Hungarian state railway from Zákány and Agram terminates 2½ m. from
  Buccari. The harbour, though sometimes dangerous to approach, affords
  good anchorage to small vessels. Owing to competition from Fiume, Buccari
  lost the greater part of its trade during the 19th century. The staple
  industry is boatbuilding, and there is an active coasting trade in fish,
  wine, wood and coal. The tunny-fishery is of some importance. In the

  renders the passage (chap. iii. 5) thus: "Trompe est longue et droite;
  buisine est courte et reflechist en li meisme si comme partie de cercle."
  On Trajan's column<a name="FnAnchor_229"
  href="#Footnote_229"><sup>[9]</sup></a> the tuba, the cornu and the
  buccina are distinguishable. Other illustrations of the buccina may be
  seen in François Mazois' <i>Les Ruines de Pompéi</i> (Paris, 1824-1838),
  pt. iv, pl. xlviii. fig. 1, and in J.N. von Wilmowsky's <i>Eine römische
  Villa zu Nennig</i> (Bonn, 1865), pl. xii. (mosaics), where the
  buccinator is accompanied on the hydraulus. The military buccina
  described is a much more advanced instrument than its prototype the
  <i>buccina marina</i>, a primitive trumpet in the shape of a conical
  shell, often having a spiral twist, which in poetry is often called
  <i>concha</i>. The buccina marina is frequently depicted in the hands of
  Tritons (Macrobius i. 8), or of sailors, as for instance on terra-cotta
  lamp shown by G.P. Bellori (<i>Lucernae veterum sepulcrales iconicae</i>,
  1702, iii. 12). The highly imaginative writer of the apocryphal letter of
  St Jerome to Dardanus also has a word to say concerning the buccina among
  the Semitic races: "Bucca vocatur tuba apud Hebreos: deinde per
  diminutionem buccina dicitur." After the fall of the Roman empire the art
  of bending metal tubes was gradually lost, and although the buccina
  survived in Europe both in name and in principle of construction during
  the middle ages, it lost for ever the characteristic curve like a "C"
  which it possessed in common with the cornu, an instrument having a
  conical bore of wider calibre. Although we regard the buccina as
  essentially Roman, an instrument of the same type, but probably straight
  and of kindred name, was widely known and used in the East, in Persia,
  Arabia and among the Semitic races. After a lapse of years during which
  records are almost wanting, the buccina reappeared all over Europe as the
  busine, buisine, pusin, busaun, pusun, posaun, busna (Slav), &amp;c.;
  whether it was a Roman survival or a re-introduction through the Moors of
  Spain in the West and the Byzantine empire in the East, we have no
  records to show. An 11th-century mural painting representing the Last
  Judgment in the cathedral of S. Angelo in Formis (near Capua), shows the
  angels blowing the last trump on busines.<a name="FnAnchor_2210"
  href="#Footnote_2210"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There are two distinct forms of the busine which may be traced during
  the middle ages:&mdash;(i) a long straight tube (fig. 2) consisting of 3
  to 5 joints of narrow cylindrical bore, the last joint alone being
  conical and ending in a pommel-shaped bell, precisely as in the curved
  buccina (fig. 1); (2) a long straight cylindrical tube of somewhat wider
  bore than the busine, ending in a wide bell curving out abruptly from the
  cylindrical tube (fig. 3).</p>

  <p>The history of the development of the trumpet, the sackbut and the
  trombone from the buccina will be found more fully treated under those
  headings; for the part played by the buccina in the evolution of the
  French horn see <span class="sc">Horn</span>.</p>

  <p><b>BUCCLEUCH, DUKES OF.</b> The substantial origin of the ducal house
  of the Scotts of Buccleuch dates back to the large grants of lands in
  Scotland to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd and Buccleuch, a border chief, by
  James II., in consequence of the fall of the 8th earl of Douglas (1452);
  but the family traced their descent back to a Sir Richard le Scott
  (1240-1285). The estate of Buccleuch is in Selkirkshire. Sir Walter Scott
  of Branxholm and Buccleuch (d. 1552) distinguished himself at the battle
  of Pinkie (1547), and furnished material for his later namesake's famous
  poem, <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>; and his great-grandson Sir
  Walter (1565-1611) was created Lord Scott of Buccleuch in 1606. An
  earldom followed in 1619. The second earl's daughter Anne (1651-1732),
  who succeeded him as a countess in her own right, married in 1663 the
  famous duke of Monmouth (<i>q.v.</i>), who was then created 1st duke of
  Buccleuch; and her grandson Francis became 2nd duke. The latter's son
  Henry (1746-1812) became 3rd duke, and in 1810 succeeded also, on the
  death of William Douglas, 4th duke of Queensberry, to that dukedom as
  well as its estates and other honours, according to the entail executed
  by his own great-grandfather, the 2nd duke of Queensberry, in 1706; he
  married the duke of Montagu's daughter, and was famous for his generosity
  and benefactions. His son Charles William Henry (d. 1819), grandson
  Walter Francis Scott (1806-1884), and great-grandson William Henry Walter
  Montagu Douglas Scott (b. 1831), succeeded in turn as 4th, 5th and 6th
  dukes of Buccleuch and 6th, 7th, and 8th dukes of Queensberry. The 5th
  duke was lord privy seal 1842-1846, and president of the council 1846. It
  was he who at a cost of over £500,000 made the harbour at Granton, near
  Edinburgh. He was president of the Highland and Agricultural Society, the
  Society of Antiquaries and of the British Association. The 6th duke sat
  in the House of Commons as Conservative M.P. for Midlothian, 1853-1868
  and 1874-1880; his wife, a daughter of the 1st duke of Abercorn, held the
  office of mistress of the robes.</p>

  <p>See Sir W. Fraser, <i>The Scotts of Buccleuch</i> (1878).</p>

  <p><b>BUCENTAUR</b> (Ital. <i>bucintoro</i>), the state gallery of the
  doges of Venice, on which, every year on Ascension day up to 1789, they
  put into the Adriatic in order to perform the ceremony of "wedding the
  sea." The name <i>bucintoro</i> is derived from the Ital. <i>buzino d'
  oro</i>, "golden bark," latinized in the middle ages as
  <i>bucentaurus</i> on the analogy of a supposed Gr. <span
  title="boukentauros" class="grk"
  >&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&kappa;&#x1F73;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  ox-centaur (from <span title="bous" class="grk"
  >&beta;&omicron;&#x1FE6;&sigmaf;</span> and <span title="Kentauros" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&#x1F73;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>).
  This led to the explanation of the name as derived from the head of an ox
  having served as the galley's figurehead. This derivation is, however,
  fanciful; the name <i>bucentaurus</i> is unknown in ancient mythology,
  and the figurehead of the bucentaurs, of which representations have come
  down to us, is the lion of St Mark. <!-- Page 713 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page713"></a>[v.04 p.0713]</span>The name
  bucentaur seems, indeed, to have been given to any great and sumptuous
  Venetian galley. Du Cange (<i>Gloss.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> "Bucentaurus")
  quotes from the chronicle of the doge Andrea Dandolo (d. 1354): <i>cum
  uno artificioso et solemni Bucentauro, super quo venit usque ad S.
  Clementem, quo jam pervenerat principalior et solemnior Bucentaurus cum
  consiliariis</i>, &amp;c. The last and most magnificent of the
  bucentaurs, built in 1729, was destroyed by the French in 1798 for the
  sake of its golden decorations. Remains of it are preserved at Venice in
  the Museo Civico Correr and in the Arsenal; in the latter there is also a
  fine model of it.</p>

  <p>The "Marriage of the Adriatic," or more correctly "of the sea"
  (<i>Sposalizio del Mar</i>) was a ceremony symbolizing the maritime
  dominion of Venice. The ceremony, established about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1000 to commemorate the doge Orseolo II.'s
  conquest of Dalmatia, was originally one of supplication and placation,
  Ascension day being chosen as that on which the doge had set out on his
  expedition. The form it took was a solemn procession of boats, headed by
  the doge's <i>maesta nave</i>, afterwards the Bucentaur (from 1311) out
  to sea by the Lido port. A prayer was offered that "for us and all who
  sail thereon the sea may be calm and quiet," whereupon the doge and the
  others were solemnly aspersed with holy water, the rest of which was
  thrown into the sea while the priests chanted "Purge me with hyssop and I
  shall be clean." To this ancient ceremony a sacramental character was
  given by Pope Alexander III in 1177, in return for the services rendered
  by Venice in the struggle against the emperor Frederick I. The pope drew
  a ring from his finger and, giving it to the doge, bade him cast such a
  one into the sea each year on Ascension day, and so wed the sea.
  Henceforth the ceremonial, instead of placatory and expiatory, became
  nuptial. Every year the doge dropped a consecrated ring into the sea, and
  with the words <i>Desponsamus te, mare</i> (We wed thee, sea) declared
  Venice and the sea to be indissolubly one (see H. F. Brown,
  <i>Venice</i>, London, 1893, pp. 69, 110).</p>

  <p><b>BUCEPHALUS</b> (Gr. <span title="boukephalos" class="grk"
  >&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&kappa;&epsilon;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>),
  the favourite Thracian horse of Alexander the Great, which died in 326
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, either of wounds received in the battle
  on the Hydaspes, or of old age. In commemoration Alexander built the city
  of Bucephala (Boukephala), the site of which is almost certainly to be
  identified with a mound on the bank of the river opposite the modern
  Jhelum.</p>

  <p>See especially Arrian v. 20; other stories in Plutarch, <i>Alex.</i>
  6; Curtius vi. 8. For the identification of Bucephala, Vincent A. Smith,

  <p><b>BUCER</b> (or <span class="sc">Butzer</span>), <b>MARTIN</b>
  (1491-1551), German Protestant reformer, was born in 1491 at Schlettstadt
  in Alsace. In 1506 he entered the Dominican order, and was sent to study
  at Heidelberg. There he became acquainted with the works of Erasmus and
  Luther, and was present at a disputation of the latter with some of the
  Romanist doctors. He became a convert to the reformed opinions, abandoned
  his order by papal dispensation in 1521, and soon afterwards married a
  nun. In 1522 he was pastor at Landstuhl in the palatinate, and travelled
  hither and thither propagating the reformed doctrine. After his
  excommunication in 1523 he made his headquarters at Strassburg, where he
  succeeded Matthew Zell. Henry VIII of England asked his advice in
  connexion with the divorce from Catherine of Aragon. On the question of
  the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, Bucer's opinions were decidedly
  Zwinglian, but he was anxious to maintain church unity with the Lutheran
  party, and constantly endeavoured, especially after Zwingli's death, to
  formulate a statement of belief that would unite Lutheran, south German
  and Swiss reformers. Hence the charge of ambiguity and obscurity which
  has been laid against him. In 1548 he was sent for to Augsburg to sign
  the agreement, called the <i>Interim</i>, between the Catholics and
  Protestants. His stout opposition to this project exposed him to many
  difficulties, and he was glad to accept Cranmer's invitation to make his
  home in England. On his arrival in 1549 he was appointed regius professor
  of divinity at Cambridge. Edward VI. and the protector Somerset showed
  him much favour and he was consulted as to the revision of the Book of
  Common Prayer. But on the 27th of February 1551 he died, and was buried
  in the university church, with great state. In 1557, by Mary's
  commissioners, his body was dug up and burnt, and his tomb demolished; it
  was subsequently reconstructed by order of Elizabeth. Bucer is said to
  have written ninety-six treatises, among them a translation and
  exposition of the Psalms and a work <i>Deregno Christi</i>. His name is
  familiar in English literature from the use made of his doctrines by
  Milton in his divorce treatises.</p>

  <p>A collected edition of his writings has never been published. A volume
  known as the <i>Tomus Anglicanus</i> (Basel, 1577) contains those written
  in England. See J.W. Baum, <i>Capito and Butzer</i> (Strassburg, 1860);
  A. Erichson, <i>Martin Butzer</i> (1891); and the articles in the
  <i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i> (by A.W. Ward), and in Herzog-Hauck's
  <i>Realencyklopädie</i> (by Paul Grünberg).</p>

  <p><b>BUCH, CHRISTIAN LEOPOLD VON,</b> <span class="sc">Baron</span>
  (1774-1853), German geologist and geographer, a member of an ancient and
  noble Prussian family, was born at Stolpe in Pomerania on the 26th of
  April 1774. In 1790-1793 he studied at the mining school of Freiberg
  under Werner, one of his fellow-students there being Alexander von
  Humboldt. He afterwards completed his education at the universities of
  Halle and Göttingen. His <i>Versuch einer mineralogischen Beschreibung
  von Landeck</i> (Breslau, 1797) was translated into French (Paris, 1805),
  and into English as <i>Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of
  Landeck</i> (Edinburgh, 1810); he also published in 1802 <i>Entwurf einer
  geognostischen Beschreibung von Schlesien (Geognostische Beobachtungen
  auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien</i>, Band i.). He was at this
  time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of his illustrious
  master. In 1797 he met Humboldt at Salzburg, and with him explored the
  geological formations of Styria, and the adjoining Alps. In the spring of
  the following year, von Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where
  his faith in the Neptunian theory was shaken. In his previous works he
  had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations. In
  1799 he paid his first visit to Vesuvius, and again in 1805 he returned
  to study the volcano, accompanied by Humboldt and Gay Lussac. They had
  the good fortune to witness a remarkable eruption, which supplied von
  Buch with data for refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained
  regarding volcanoes. In 1802 he had explored the extinct volcanoes of
  Auvergne. The aspect of the Puy de Dôme, with its cone of trachyte and
  its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to abandon as untenable the
  doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks. The scientific
  results of his investigations he embodied in his <i>Geognostische
  Beobachtungen auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien</i> (Berlin,
  1802-1809). From the south of Europe von Buch repaired to the north, and
  spent two years among the Scandinavian islands, making many important
  observations on the geography of plants, on climatology and on geology.
  He showed that many of the erratic blocks on the North German plains must
  have come from Scandinavia. He also established the fact that the whole
  of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea
  from Frederikshald to Abo. The details of these discoveries are given in
  his <i>Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland</i> (Berlin, 1810). In 1815 he
  visited the Canary Islands in company with Christian Smith, the Norwegian
  botanist. His observations here convinced him that these and other
  islands of the Atlantic owed their existence to volcanic action of the
  most intense kind, and that the groups of islands in the South Sea are
  the remains of a pre-existing continent. The physical description of the
  Canary Islands was published at Berlin in 1825, and this work alone is
  regarded as an enduring monument of his labours. After leaving the
  Canaries von Buch proceeded to the Hebrides and the coasts of Scotland
  and Ireland. Palaeontology also claimed his attention, and he described
  in 1831 and later years a number of Cephalopods, Brachiopods and
  Cystidea, and pointed out their stratigraphical importance. In addition
  to the works already mentioned von Buch published in 1832 the magnificent
  <i>Geological Map of Germany</i> (42 sheets, Berlin). His geological
  excursions were continued without interruption till his 78th year. Eight
  months before his death he visited <!-- Page 714 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page714"></a>[v.04 p.0714]</span>the mountains
  of Auvergne; and on returning home he read a paper on the Jurassic
  formation before the Academy of Berlin. He died at Berlin on the 4th of
  March 1853. Von Buch had inherited from his father a fortune more than
  sufficient for his wants. He was never married, and was unembarrassed by
  family ties. His excursions were always taken on foot, with a staff in
  his hand, and the large pockets of his overcoat filled with papers and
  geological instruments. Under this guise, the passer-by would not easily
  have recognized the man whom Humboldt pronounced the greatest geologist
  of his time.</p>

  <p>A complete edition of his works was published at Berlin
  (1867-1885).</p>

  <p><b>BUCHAN, EARLS OF.</b> The earldom of Mar and Buchan was one of the
  seven original Scottish earldoms; later, Buchan was separated from Mar,
  and among the early earls of Buchan were Alexander Comyn (d. 1289), John
  Comyn (d. <i>c.</i> 1313), both constables of Scotland, and Henry
  Beaumont (d. 1340), who had married a Comyn. John Comyn's wife, Isabel,
  was the countess of Buchan who crowned Robert the Bruce king at Scone in
  1306, and was afterwards imprisoned at Berwick; not, however, in a cage
  hung on the wall of the castle. About 1382 Sir Alexander Stewart (d.
  <i>c.</i> 1404), the "wolf of Badenoch," a son of King Robert II., became
  earl of Buchan, and the Stewarts appear to have held the earldom for
  about a century and a half, although not in a direct line from Sir
  Alexander.<a name="FnAnchor_231" href="#Footnote_231"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  Among the most celebrated of the Stewart earls were the Scottish regent,
  Robert, duke of Albany, and his son John, who was made constable of
  France and was killed at the battle of Verneuil in 1424. In 1617 the
  earldom came to James Erskine (d. 1640), a son of John Erskine, 2nd (or
  7th) earl of Mar, whose wife Mary had inherited it from her father, James
  Douglas (d. 1601), and from that time it has been retained by the
  Erskines.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most celebrated of the later earls of Buchan was the
  eccentric David Steuart Erskine, 11th earl (1742-1829), a son of Henry
  David, 10th earl (d. 1767), and brother of Henry Erskine (<i>q.v.</i>),
  and of Thomas, Lord Erskine (<i>q.v.</i>). His pertinacity was
  instrumental in effecting a change in the method of electing Scottish
  representative peers, and in 1780 he succeeded in founding the Scottish
  Society of Antiquaries. Among his correspondents was Horace Walpole, and
  he wrote an <i>Essay on the Lives of Fletcher of Saltoun and the Poet
  Thomson</i> (1792), and other writings. He died at his residence at
  Dryburgh in April 1829, leaving no legitimate children, and was followed
  as 12th earl by his nephew Henry David (1783-1857), the ancestor of the
  present peer. The 11th earl's natural son, Sir David Erskine (1772-1837),
  who inherited his father's unentailed estates, was an antiquary and a
  dramatist.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Footnote_231" href="#FnAnchor_231">[1]</a> In August 1908,
  during some excavations at Dunkeld, remains were found which are supposed
  to be those of Alexander Stewart, the "wolf of Badenoch."</p>

</div>
  <p><b>BUCHAN, ELSPETH</b> (1738-1791), founder of a Scottish religious
  sect known as the Buchanites, was the daughter of John Simpson,
  proprietor of an inn near Banff. Having quarrelled with her husband,
  Robert Buchan, a potter of Greenock, she settled with her children in
  Glasgow, where she was deeply impressed by a sermon preached by Hugh
  White, minister of the Relief church at Irvine. She persuaded White and
  others that she was a saint with a special mission, that in fact she was
  the woman, and White the man-child, described in Revelation xii. White
  was condemned by the presbytery, and the sect, which ultimately numbered
  forty-six adherents, was expelled by the magistrates in 1784 and settled
  in a farm, consisting of one room and a loft, known as New Cample in
  Dumfriesshire. Mrs Buchan claimed prophetic inspiration and pretended to
  confer the Holy Ghost upon her followers by breathing upon them; they
  believed that the millennium was near, and that they would not die, but
  be translated. It appears that they had community of wives and lived on
  funds provided by the richer members. Robert Burns, the poet, in a letter
  dated August 1784, describes the sect as idle and immoral. In 1785 White
  and Mrs Buchan published a <i>Divine Dictionary</i>, but the sect broke
  up on the death of its founder in spite of White's attempts to prove that
  she was only in a trance. Even White was eventually undeceived. Andrew
  Innes, the last survivor, died in 1848. See J. Train, <i>The Buchanites
  from First to Last</i> (Edinburgh, 1846).</p>

  <p><b>BUCHAN, PETER</b> (1790-1854), Scottish editor, was born at
  Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, in 1790. In 1816 he started in business as a
  printer at Peterhead, and was successful enough to be able eventually to
  retire and devote himself to the collection and editing of Scottish
  ballads. His <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland</i>
  (1828) contained a large number of hitherto unpublished ballads, and
  newly discovered versions of existing ones. Another collection made by
  him was published by the Percy Society, under the title <i>Scottish
  Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads</i> (1845). Two unpublished
  volumes of Buchan's ballad collections are in the British Museum. He died
  on the 19th of September 1854.</p>

  <p><b>BUCHANAN, CLAUDIUS</b> (1766-1815), English divine, was born at
  Cambuslang, near Glasgow, and educated at the universities of Glasgow and
  Cambridge. He was ordained in 1795, and after holding a chaplaincy in
  India at Barrackpur (1797-1799) was appointed Calcutta chaplain and
  vice-principal of the college of Fort William. In this capacity he did
  much to advance Christianity and native education in India, especially by
  organizing systematic translations of the Scriptures. An account of his
  travels in the south and west of India, which added considerably to our
  knowledge of nature life, is given in his <i>Christian Researches in
  Asia</i> (Cambridge, 1811). After his return to England in 1808, he still
  took an active part in matters connected with India, and by his book
  entitled <i>Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishment</i> (London, 1813), he
  assisted in settling the controversy of 1813, which ended in the
  establishment of the Indian episcopate.</p>

  <p><b>BUCHANAN, GEORGE</b> (1506-1582), Scottish humanist, was born in
  February 1506. His father, a younger son of an old family, was the
  possessor of the farm of Moss, in the parish of Killearn, Stirlingshire,
  but he died at an early age, leaving his widow and children in poverty.
  His mother, Agnes Heriot, was of the family of the Heriots of Trabroun,
  Haddingtonshire, of which George Heriot, founder of Heriot's hospital,
  was also a member. Buchanan is said to have attended Killearn school, but
  not much is known of his early education. In 1520 he was sent by his
  uncle, James Heriot, to the university of Paris, where, as he tells us in
  an autobiographical sketch, he devoted himself to the writing of verses
  "partly by liking, partly by compulsion (that being then the one task
  prescribed to youth)." In 1522 his uncle died, and Buchanan being thus
  unable to continue longer in Paris, returned to Scotland. After
  recovering from a severe illness, he joined the French auxiliaries who
  had been brought over by John Stewart, duke of Albany, and took part in
  an unsuccessful inroad into England (see the account in his <i>Hist. of
  Scotland</i>). In the following year he entered the university of St
  Andrews, where he graduated B.A. in 1525. He had gone there chiefly for
  the purpose of attending the celebrated John Major's lectures on logic;
  and when that teacher removed to Paris, Buchanan followed him in 1526. In
  1527 he graduated B.A., and in 1528 M.A. at Paris. Next year he was
  appointed regent, or professor, in the college of Sainte-Barbe, and
  taught there for upwards of three years. In 1529 he was elected
  Procurator of the "German Nation" in the university of Paris, and was
  re-elected four times in four successive months. He resigned his
  regentship in 1531, and in 1532 became tutor to Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd earl
  of Cassilis, with whom he returned to Scotland about the beginning of
  1537.</p>

  <p>At this period Buchanan was content to assume the same attitude
  towards the Church of Rome that Erasmus maintained. He did not repudiate
  its doctrines, but considered himself free to criticize its practice.
  Though he listened with interest to the arguments of the Reformers, he
  did not join their ranks before 1553. His first production in Scotland,
  when he was in Lord Cassilis's household in the west country, was the
  poem <i>Somnium</i>, a satirical attack upon the Franciscan friars and
  monastic life generally. This assault on the monks was not displeasing to
  James V., who engaged Buchanan as tutor to one of his natural <!-- Page
  715 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page715"></a>[v.04
  p.0715]</span>sons, Lord James Stewart (not the son who was afterwards
  the regent Murray), and encouraged him to a still more daring effort. In
  these circumstances the poems <i>Palinodia</i> and <i>Franciscanus &amp;
  Fratres</i> were written, and, although they remained unpublished for
  many years, it is not surprising that the author became an object of
  bitterest hatred to the order and their friends. Nor was it yet a safe
  matter to assail the church. In 1539 there was a bitter persecution of
  the Lutherans, and Buchanan among others was arrested. He managed to
  effect his escape and with considerable difficulty made his way to London
  and thence to Paris. In Paris, however, he found his enemy, Cardinal
  David Beaton, who was there as an ambassador, and on the invitation of
  André de Gouvéa, proceeded to Bordeaux. Gouvéa was then principal of the
  newly founded college of Guienne at Bordeaux, and by his exertions
  Buchanan was appointed professor of Latin. During his residence here
  several of his best works, the translations of <i>Medea</i> and
  <i>Alcestis</i>, and the two dramas, <i>Jephthes (sive Votum)</i> and
  <i>Baptistes (sive Calumnia)</i>, were completed. Montaigne was
  Buchanan's pupil at Bordeaux and acted in his tragedies. In the essay
  <i>Of Presumption</i> he classes Buchanan with Aurat, Béza, de L'Hopital,
  Montdore and Turnebus, as one of the foremost Latin poets of his time.
  Here also Buchanan formed a lasting friendship with Julius Caesar
  Scaliger; in later life he won the admiration of Joseph Scaliger, who
  wrote an epigram on Buchanan which contains the couplet, famous in its
  day:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia limes;</p>
      <p>Romani eloquii Scotia limes erit?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In 1542 or 1543 he returned to Paris, and in 1544 was appointed regent
  in the college of Cardinal le Moine. Among his colleagues were the
  renowned Muretus and Turnebus.</p>

  <p>In 1547 Buchanan joined the band of French and Portuguese humanists
  who had been invited by André de Gouvéa to lecture in the Portuguese
  university of Coimbra. The French mathematician Élie Vinet, and the
  Portuguese historian, Jeronimo de Osorio, were among his colleagues;
  Gouvéa, called by Montaigne <i>le plus grand principal de France</i>, was
  rector of the university, which had reached the summit of its prosperity
  under the patronage of King John III. But the rectorship had been coveted
  by Diogo de Gouvéa, uncle of André and formerly head of Sainte-Barbe. It
  is probable that before André's death at the end of 1547 Diogo had urged
  the Inquisition to attack him and his staff; up to 1906, when the records
  of the trial were first published in full, Buchanan's biographers
  generally attributed the attack to the influence of Cardinal Beaton, the
  Franciscans, or the Jesuits, and the whole history of Buchanan's
  residence in Portugal was extremely obscure.</p>

  <p>A commission of inquiry was appointed in October 1549 and reported in
  June 1550. Buchanan and two Portuguese, Diogo de Teive and Jo&#x101;o da
  Costa (who had succeeded to the rectorship), were committed for trial.
  Teive and Costa were found guilty of various offences against public
  order, and the evidence shows that there was ample reason for a judicial
  inquiry. Buchanan was accused of Lutheran and Judaistic practices. He
  defended himself with conspicuous ability, courage and frankness,
  admitting that some of the charges were true. About June 1551 he was
  sentenced to abjure his errors, and to be imprisoned in the monastery of
  S&#x101;o Bento in Lisbon. Here he was compelled to listen to edifying
  discourses from the monks, whom he found "not unkind but ignorant." In
  his leisure he began to translate the Psalms into Latin verse. After
  seven months he was released, on condition that he remained in Lisbon;
  and on the 28th of February 1552 this restriction was annulled. Buchanan
  at once sailed for England, but soon made his way to Paris, where in 1553
  he was appointed regent in the college of Boncourt. He remained in that
  post for two years, and then accepted the office of tutor to the son of
  the Maréchal de Brissac. It was almost certainly during this last stay in
  France, where Protestantism was being repressed with great severity by
  Francis I., that Buchanan ranged himself on the side of the
  Calvinists.</p>

  <p>In 1560 or 1561 he returned to Scotland, and in April 1562 we find him
  installed as tutor to the young queen Mary, who was accustomed to read
  Livy with him daily. Buchanan now openly joined the Protestant, or
  Reformed Church, and in 1566 was appointed by the earl of Murray
  principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews. Two years before he had
  received from the queen the valuable gift of the revenues of Crossraguel
  Abbey. He was thus in good circumstances, and his fame was steadily
  increasing. So great, indeed, was his reputation for learning and
  administrative capacity that, though a layman, he was made moderator of
  the general assembly in 1567. He had sat in the assemblies from 1563.</p>

  <p>Buchanan accompanied the regent Murray into England, and his
  <i>Detectio</i> (published in 1572) was produced to the commissioners at
  Westminster. In 1570, after the assassination of Murray, he was appointed
  one of the preceptors of the young king, and it was through his tuition
  that James VI. acquired his scholarship. While discharging the functions
  of royal tutor he also held other important offices. He was for a short
  time director of chancery, and then became lord privy seal, a post which
  entitled him to a seat in the parliament. He appears to have continued in
  this office for some years, at least till 1579. He died on the 28th of
  September 1582.</p>

  <p>His last years had been occupied with two of his most important works.
  The first was the treatise <i>De Jure Regni apud Scotos</i>, published in
  1579. In this famous work, composed in the form of a dialogue, and
  evidently intended to instil sound political principles into the mind of
  his pupil, Buchanan lays down the doctrine that the source of all
  political power is the people, that the king is bound by those conditions
  under which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that
  it is lawful to resist, even to punish, tyrants. The importance of the
  work is proved by the persistent efforts of the legislature to suppress
  it during the century following its publication. It was condemned by act
  of parliament in 1584, and again in 1664; and in 1683 it was burned by
  the university of Oxford. The second of his larger works is the history
  of Scotland, <i>Rerum Scoticarum Historia</i>, completed shortly before
  his death (1579), and published in 1582. It is of great value for the
  period personally known to the author, which occupies the greater portion
  of the book. The earlier part is based, to a considerable extent, on the
  legendary history of Boece. Buchanan's purpose was to "purge" the
  national history "of sum Inglis lyis and Scottis vanite" (<i>Letter to
  Randolph</i>), but he exaggerated his freedom from partisanship and
  unconsciously criticized his work when he said that it would "content few
  and displease many."</p>

  <p>Buchanan is one of Scotland's greatest scholars. For mastery over the
  Latin language he has seldom been surpassed by any modern writer. His
  style is not rigidly modelled upon that of any classical author, but has
  a certain freshness and elasticity of its own. He wrote Latin as if it
  had been his mother tongue. But in addition to this perfect command over
  the language, Buchanan had a rich vein of poetical feeling, and much
  originality of thought. His translations of the Psalms and of the Greek
  plays are more than mere versions; the smaller satirical poems abound in
  wit and in happy phrase; his two tragedies, <i>Baptistes</i> and
  <i>Jephthes</i>, have enjoyed from the first an undiminished European
  reputation for academic excellence. In addition to the works already
  named, Buchanan wrote in prose <i>Chamaeleon</i>, a satire in the
  vernacular against Maitland of Lethington, first printed in 1711; a Latin
  translation of Linacre's Grammar (Paris, 1533); <i>Libettus de
  Prosodia</i> (Edinburgh, 1640); and <i>Vita ab ipso scripta biennio ante
  mortem</i> (1608), edited by R. Sibbald (1702). His other poems are
  <i>Fratres Fraterrimi</i>, <i>Elegiae</i>, <i>Silvae</i>, two sets of
  verses entitled <i>Hendecasyllabon Liber</i> and <i>Iambon Liber</i>;
  three books of <i>Epigrammata</i>; a book of miscellaneous verse; <i>De
  Sphaera</i> (in five books), suggested by the poem of Joannes de
  Sacrobosco, and intended as a defence of the Ptolemaic theory against the
  new Copernican view.</p>

  <p>There are two editions of Buchanan's works:&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
  <i>Georgii Buchanani Scoti, Poetarum sui seculi facile principis, Opera
  Omnia</i>, in two vols. fol., edited by Ruddiman (Edinburgh, Freebairn,
  1715); (b) edited by Burman, 4to, 1725. The <i>Vernacular Writings</i>,
  <!-- Page 716 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page716"></a>[v.04
  p.0716]</span>consisting of the <i>Chamaeleon</i> (<i>u.s.</i>), a tract
  on the Reformation of St Andrews University, <i>Ane Admonitioun to the
  Trew Lordis</i>, and two letters, were edited for the Scottish Text
  Society by P. Hume Brown. The principal biographies are:&mdash;David
  Irving, <i>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of George Buchanan</i>
  (Edinburgh,1807 and 1817); P. Hume Brown, <i>George Buchanan, Humanist
  and Reformer</i> (Edinburgh, 1890), <i>George Buchanan and his Times</i>
  (Edinburgh, 1906); Rev. D. Macmillan, <i>George Buchanan, a Biography</i>
  (Edinburgh, 1906). Buchanan's quatercentenary was celebrated at different
  centres in Scotland in 1906, and was the occasion of several encomia and
  studies. The most important of these are: <i>George Buchanan: Glasgow
  Quatercentenary Studies</i> (Glasgow, 1906), and <i>George Buchanan, a
  Memoir</i>, edited by D.A. Millar (St Andrews, 1907). A verse translation
  of the <i>Baptistes</i>, entitled <i>Tyrannicall-Government
  Anatomized</i> (1642), has been attributed to Milton; its authorship is
  discussed in the <i>Glasgow Quatercentenary Studies</i>. The records of
  Buchanan's trial, discovered by the Portuguese historian, G.J.C.
  Henriques, were published by him under the title <i>George Buchanan in
  the Lisbon Inquisition. The Records of his Trial, with a Translation
  thereof into English, Facsimiles of some of the Papers, and an
  Introduction</i> (Lisbon, 1906).</p>

  <p><b>BUCHANAN, JAMES</b> (1791-1868), fifteenth president of the United
  States, was born near Foltz, Franklin county, Pennsylvania, on the 23rd
  of April 1791. Both parents were of Scottish-Irish Presbyterian descent.
  He graduated at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1809,
  studied law at Lancaster in 1809-1812, and was admitted to the bar in
  1812. He served in the lower house of the state legislature in 1814-1816,
  and as a representative in Congress from 1821 to 1831. As chairman of the
  judiciary committee he conducted the impeachment trial (1830) of Judge
  James H. Peck, led an unsuccessful movement to increase the number of
  Supreme Court judges and to relieve them of their circuit duties, and
  succeeded in defeating an attempt to repeal the twenty-fifth section of
  the Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Supreme Court appellate
  jurisdiction by writ of error to the state courts in cases where federal
  laws and treaties are in question. After the dissolution of the
  Federalist party, of which he had been a member, he supported the
  Jackson-Van Buren faction, and soon came to be definitely associated with
  the Democrats. He represented the United States at the court of St
  Petersburg in 1832-1833, and there negotiated an important commercial
  treaty. He was a Democratic member of the United States Senate from
  December 1834 until March 1845, ardently supporting President Jackson,
  and was secretary of state in the cabinet of President Polk from 1845 to
  1849&mdash;a period marked by the annexation of Texas, the Mexican War,
  and negotiations with Great Britain relative to the Oregon question.
  After four years of retirement spent in the practice of his profession,
  he was appointed by President Pierce minister to Great Britain in
  1853.</p>

  <p>Up to this time Buchanan's attitude on the slavery question had been
  that held by the conservative element among Northern Democrats. He felt
  that the institution was morally wrong, but held that Congress could not
  interfere with it in the states in which it existed, and ought not to
  hinder the natural tendency toward territorial expansion through a fear
  that the evil would spread. He voted for the bill to exclude anti-slavery
  literature from the mails, approved of the annexation of Texas, the war
  with Mexico, and the Compromise of 1850, and disapproved of the Wilmot
  Proviso. Fortunately for his career he was abroad during the
  Kansas-Nebraska debates, and hence did not share in the unpopularity
  which attached to Stephen A. Douglas as the author of the bill, and to
  President Pierce as the executive who was called upon to enforce it. At
  the same time, by joining with J.Y. Mason and Pierre Soule in issuing the
  Ostend Manifesto in 1854, he retained the good-will of the South.<a
  name="FnAnchor_241" href="#Footnote_241"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Accordingly
  on his return from England in 1856 he was nominated by the Democrats as a
  compromise candidate for president, and was elected, receiving 174
  electoral votes to 114 for John C. Frémont, Republican, and 8 for Millard
  Fillmore, American or "Know-Nothing."</p>

  <p>His high moral character, the breadth of his legal knowledge, and his
  experience as congressman, cabinet member and diplomat, would have made
  Buchanan an excellent president in ordinary times; but he lacked the
  soundness of judgment, the self-reliance and the moral courage needed to
  face a crisis. At the beginning of his administration he appointed Robert
  J. Walker of Mississippi, territorial governor of Kansas, and Frederick
  P. Stanton of Tennessee, secretary, and assured them of his determination
  to adhere to the popular sovereignty principle. He soon began to use his
  influence, however, to force the admission of Kansas into the Union under
  the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, contrary to the wishes of the
  majority of the settlers. Stanton was removed from office for opposing
  the scheme, and Walker resigned in disgust. This change of policy was
  doubtless the result of timidity rather than of a desire to secure
  re-election by gaining the favour of the Southern Democracy. Under the
  influence of Howell Cobb of Georgia, secretary of the treasury, and Jacob
  Thompson of Mississippi, secretary of the interior, the president was
  convinced that it was the only way to avoid civil war. Federal patronage
  was freely used to advance the Lecompton measure and the compromise
  English Bill, and to prevent Douglas's election to the Senate in 1858.
  Some of these facts were brought out in the famous Covode Investigation
  conducted by a committee of the House of Representatives in 1860. The
  investigations, however, were very partisan in character, and there is
  reason to doubt the constitutional power of the House to make it, except
  as the basis for an impeachment trial.</p>

  <p>The call issued by the South Carolina legislature just after the
  election of Lincoln for a state convention to decide upon the
  advisability of secession brought forward the most serious question of
  Buchanan's administration. The part of his annual message of the 4th of
  December 1860 dealing with it is based upon a report prepared by
  Attorney-General Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania. He argued that a
  state had no legal right to secede, but denied that the federal
  government had any power forcibly to prevent it. At the same time it was
  the duty of the president to call out the army and navy of the United
  States to protect federal property or to enforce federal laws. Soon after
  the secession movement began the Southern members of the cabinet
  resigned, and the president gradually came under the influence of Black,
  Stanton, Dix, and other Northern leaders. He continued, however, to work
  for a peaceful settlement, supporting the Crittenden Compromise and the
  work of the Peace Congress. He disapproved of Major Anderson's removal of
  his troops from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in December 1860; but there
  is probably no basis for the charge made by Southern writers that the
  removal itself was in violation of a pledge given by the president to
  preserve the <i>status quo</i> in Charleston harbour until the arrival of
  the South Carolina commissioners in Washington. Equally unfounded is the
  assertion first made by Thurlow Weed in the London <i>Observer</i> (9th
  of February 1862) that the president was prevented from ordering Anderson
  back to Fort Moultrie only by the threat of four members of the cabinet
  to resign.</p>

  <p>On the expiration of his term of office (March 4, 1861) Buchanan
  retired to his home at Wheatland, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he
  died on the 1st of June 1868. His mistakes as president have been so
  emphasized as to obscure the fact that he was a man of unimpeachable
  honesty, of the highest patriotism, and of considerable ability. He never
  married.</p>

  <p>See George Ticknor Curtis, <i>The Life of James Buchanan</i> (2 vols.,
  New York, 1883), the standard biography; Curtis, however, was a close
  personal and political friend, and his work is too eulogistic. More
  trustworthy, but at times unduly severe, is the account given by James
  Ford Rhodes in the first two volumes of his <i>History of the United
  States since the Compromise of 1850</i> (New York, new edition,
  1902-1907). John Bassett Moore has edited <i>The Works of James Buchanan,
  comprising his Speeches, State Papers, and Private Correspondence</i>
  (Philadelphia, 1908-1910).</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Footnote_241" href="#FnAnchor_241">[1]</a> This "manifesto,"
  which was bitterly attacked in the North, was agreed upon (October 18,
  1854) by the three ministers after several meetings at Ostend and at
  Aix-la-Chapelle, arranged in pursuance of instructions to them from
  President Pierce to "compare opinions, and to adopt measures for perfect
  concert of action in aid of the negotiations at Madrid" on the subject of
  reparations demanded from Spain by the United States for alleged injuries
  to American commerce with Cuba. In the manifesto the three ministers
  asserted that "from the peculiarity of its geographical position, and the
  considerations attendant upon it, Cuba is as necessary to the North
  American republic as any of its present members"; spoke of the danger to
  the United States of an insurrection in Cuba; asserted that "we should be
  recreant to our duty, be unworthy of our gallant forefathers, and commit
  base treason against our posterity, should we permit Cuba to be
  Africanized and become a second Santo Domingo, with all its attendant
  horrors to the white race, and suffer the flames to extend to our own
  neighboring shores, seriously to endanger or actually destroy the fair
  fabric of our Union"; and recommended that "the United States ought, if
  practicable, to purchase Cuba as soon as possible." To Spain, they
  argued, the sale of the island would be a great advantage. The most
  startling declaration of the manifesto was that if Spain should refuse to
  sell "after we shall have offered a price for Cuba far beyond its present
  value," and if Cuba, in the possession of Spain, should seriously
  endanger "our internal peace and the existence of our cherished Union,"
  then "by every law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting
  it from Spain if we have the power."</p>

  <p><b>BUCHANAN, ROBERT WILLIAMS</b> (1841-1901), British poet, novelist
  and dramatist, son of Robert Buchanan (1813-1866), Owenite lecturer and
  journalist, was born at Caverswall, Staffordshire, on the 18th of August
  1841. His father, a native of Ayr, after living for some years in
  Manchester, removed to Glasgow, where Buchanan was educated, at the high
  school and the university, one of his fellow-students being the poet
  David Gray. His essay on Gray, originally contributed to the <i>Cornhill
  Magazine</i>, tells the story of their close friendship, and of their
  journey to London in 1860 in search of fame. After a period of struggle
  and disappointment Buchanan published <i>Undertones</i> in 1863. This
  "tentative" volume was followed by <i>Idyls and Legends of Inverburn</i>
  (1865), <i>London Poems</i> (1866), and <i>North Coast and other
  Poems</i> (1868), wherein he displayed a faculty for poetic narrative,
  and a sympathetic insight into the humbler conditions of life. On the
  whole, Buchanan is at his best in these narrative poems, though he
  essayed a more ambitious flight in <i>The Book of Orm: A Prelude to the
  Epic</i>, a study in mysticism, which appeared in 1870. He was a frequent
  contributor to periodical literature, and obtained notoriety by an
  article which, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Thomas Maitland, he
  contributed to the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for October 1871, entitled
  "The Fleshly School of Poetry." This article was expanded into a pamphlet
  (1872), but he subsequently withdrew from the criticisms it contained,
  and it is chiefly remembered by the replies it evoked from D.G. Rossetti
  in a letter to the <i>Athenaeum</i> (16th December 1871), entitled "The
  Stealthy School of Criticism," and from Mr Swinburne in <i>Under the
  Microscope</i> (1872). Buchanan himself afterwards regretted the violence
  of his attack, and the "old enemy" to whom <i>God and the Man</i> is
  dedicated was Rossetti. In 1876 appeared <i>The Shadow of the Sword</i>,
  the first and one of the best of a long series of novels. Buchanan was
  also the author of many successful plays, among which may be mentioned
  <i>Lady Clare</i>, produced in 1883; <i>Sophia</i> (1886), an adaptation
  of <i>Tom Jones; A Man's Shadow</i> (1890); and <i>The Charlatan</i>
  (1894). He also wrote, in collaboration with Harriett Jay, the melodrama
  <i>Alone in London</i>. In 1896 he became, so far as some of his work was
  concerned, his own publisher. In the autumn of 1900 he had a paralytic
  seizure, from which he never recovered. He died at Streatham on the 10th
  of June 1901.</p>

  <p>Buchanan's poems were collected into three volumes in 1874, into one
  volume in 1884; and as <i>Complete Poetical Works</i> (2 vols., 1901).
  Among his poems should also be mentioned: "The Drama of Kings" (1871);
  "St Abe and his Seven Wives," a lively tale of Salt Lake City, published
  anonymously in 1872; and "Balder the Beautiful" (1877); "The City of
  Dream" (1888); "The Outcast: a Rhyme for the Time" (1891); and "The
  Wandering Jew" (1893). His earlier novels, <i>The Shadow of the
  Sword</i>, and <i>God and the Man</i> (1881), a striking tale of a family
  feud, are distinguished by a certain breadth and simplicity of treatment
  which is not so noticeable in their successors, among which may be
  mentioned <i>The Martyrdom of Madeline</i> (1882); <i>Foxglove Manor</i>
  (1885); <i>Effie Hetherington</i> (1896); and <i>Father Anthony</i>
  (1898). <i>David Gray and other Essays, chiefly on Poetry</i> (1868);
  <i>Master Spirits</i> (1873); <i>A Poet's Sketch Book</i> (1883), in
  which the interesting essay on Gray is reprinted; and <i>A Look round
  Literature</i> (1887), contain Buchanan's chief contributions to
  periodical literature. More valuable is <i>The Land of Lorne</i> (2
  vols., 1871), a vivid record of yachting experiences on the west coast of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>See also Harriett Jay, <i>Robert Buchanan; some Account of his
  Life</i> (1903).</p>

  <p><b>BUCHAREST</b> (<i>Bucuresci</i>), also written Bucarest, Bukarest,
  Bukharest, Bukorest and Bukhorest, the capital of Rumania, and chief town
  of the department of Ilfov. Although <i>Bucharest</i> is the conventional
  English spelling, the forms <i>Bucarest</i> and <i>Bukarest</i> more
  nearly represent the correct pronunciation. The population in 1900 was
  282,071, including 43,274 Jews, and 53,056 aliens, mostly
  Austro-Hungarian subjects. With its outlying parts, Bucharest covers more
  than 20 sq. m. It lies in a hollow, traversed from north-west to
  south-east by the river Dimbovitza (<i>Dâmbovita</i> or
  <i>Dîmbovita</i>), and is built mainly on the left bank. A range of low
  hills affords shelter on the west and south-west; but on every other side
  there are drained, though still unhealthy, marshes, stretching away to
  meet the central Walachian plains. From a distance, the multitude of its
  gardens, and the turrets and metal-plated or gilded cupolas of its many
  churches give Bucharest a certain picturesqueness. In a few of the older
  districts, too, where land is least valuable, there are antique
  one-storeyed houses, surrounded by poplars and acacias; while the gipsies
  and Rumans, wearing their brightly coloured native costumes, the Russian
  coachmen, or sleigh-drivers, of the banished Lipovan sect, and the
  pedlars, with their doleful street cries, render Bucharest unlike any
  western capital. Nevertheless, the city is modern. Until about 1860,
  indeed, the dimly lit lanes were paved with rough stone blocks, imbedded
  in the clay soil, which often subsided, so as to leave the surface
  undulating like a sea. Drains were rare, epidemics common. Owing to the
  frequency of earthquakes, many houses were built of wood, and in 1847
  fully a quarter of the city was laid waste by fire. The plague visited
  Bucharest in 1718, 1738, 1793, when an earthquake destroyed a number of
  old buildings, and in 1813, when 70,000 of the inhabitants died in six
  weeks. From the accession of Prince Charles, in 1866, a gradual reform
  began. The river was enclosed between stone embankments; sewerage and
  pure water were supplied, gas and electric light installed; and horse or
  electric tramways laid down in the principal thoroughfares, which were
  paved with granite or wood. The older houses are of brick, overlaid with
  white or tinted plaster, and ornamented with figures or foliage in
  terra-cotta; but owing to the great changes of temperature in Rumania,
  the plaster soon cracks and peels off, giving a dilapidated appearance to
  many streets. The chief modern buildings, such as the Athenaeum, with its
  Ionic façade and Byzantine dome, are principally on the quays and
  boulevards, and are constructed of stone.</p>

  <p>Bucharest is often called "The Paris of the East," partly from a
  supposed social resemblance, partly from the number of its boulevards and
  avenues. Three main thoroughfares, the Plevna, Lipscani, and Vacaresci,
  skirt the left bank of the river; the Elizabeth Boulevard, and the Calea
  Victoriei, or "Avenue of Victory," which commemorates the Rumanian
  success at Plevna, in 1877, radiate east and north, respectively, from
  the Lipscani, and meet a broad road which surrounds all sides of
  Bucharest, except the north-west. The Lipscani was originally the street
  of merchants who obtained their wares from the annual fair at Leipzig;
  for almost all crafts or gilds, other than the bakers and tavern-keepers,
  were long confined to separate quarters; and the old names have survived,
  as in the musicians', furriers', and money-changers' quarters. Continuous
  with the Calea Victoriei, on the north, is the Kisilev Park, traversed by
  the Chausée, a favourite drive, leading to the pretty Baneasa
  race-course, where spring and autumn meetings are held. The Cismegiu or
  Cismigiu Park, which has a circumference of about 1 m., is laid out
  between the Plevna road and the Calea Victoriei; and there are botanical
  and zoological gardens.</p>

  <p>The Orthodox Greek churches are generally small, with very narrow
  windows, and are built of brick in a modified Byzantine style. They are
  usually surmounted by two or three towers, but the bells are hung in a
  kind of wooden porch, resembling a <!-- Page 718 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page718"></a>[v.04 p.0718]</span>lych-gate, and
  standing about twenty paces from the church. The cathedral, or
  metropolitan church, where the metropolitan primate of Rumania
  officiates, was built between 1656 and 1665. It has the shape of a Greek
  cross, surrounded by a broad cloister, with four main entrances, each
  surmounted by a turret. The whole culminates in three brick towers.
  Standing on high ground, the cathedral overlooks all Bucharest, and
  commands a view of the Carpathians. Other interesting churches are St
  Spiridion the New (1768), the loftiest and most beautiful of all; the
  Doamna Balasa (1751), noteworthy for its rich carved work without, and
  frescoes within; and the ancient Biserica Bucur, said, in local
  traditions, to derive its name from Bucur, a shepherd whom legend makes
  the founder of Bucharest. The real founder and date of this church, and
  of many others, are unknown, thanks to the frequent obliteration of
  Slavonic inscriptions by the Greek clergy. The Protestants, Armenians and
  Lipovans worship in their own churches, and the Jews have several
  synagogues. Bucharest is also the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop;
  but the Roman Catholics, though numbering nearly 37,000 in 1899, possess
  only three churches, including the cathedral of St Joseph.</p>

  <p>Bucharest is a great educational centre. Besides the ordinary
  ecclesiastical seminaries, lyceums, gymnasia and elementary schools, it
  possesses schools of commerce, science and art institutes, and training
  colleges, for engineers and veterinary surgeons; while the university,
  founded in 1864, has faculties of theology, philosophy, literature, law,
  science, medicine and pharmacy. Students pay no fees except for board.
  The national library, containing many precious Oriental documents, and
  the meeting-hall of the Rumanian senate, are both included in the
  university buildings, which, with the Athenaeum (used for literary
  conferences and for music), and the central girls' school, are regarded
  as the best example of modern Rumanian architecture. Other libraries are
  those of the Nifon seminary, of the Charles University Foundation
  (<i>Fundatiunea universitara Carol</i>), which endows research, and
  rewards literary or scientific merit; the central library, and the
  library of the Academy, which also contains a museum of natural history
  and antiquities. Among philanthropic institutions may be mentioned the
  Coltei, Brancovan, Maternitate, Philantropia and Pantelimon hospitals;
  the Marcutza lunatic asylum; and the Princess Elena refuge (<i>Asilul
  Elena Doamna</i>), founded by Princess Elena Couza in 1862, to provide
  for 230 orphan girls. The summer home of these girls is a convent in the
  Transylvanian Alps. Hotels and restaurants are numerous. There are two
  theatres, the National and the Lyric, which is mainly patronized by
  foreign players; but minor places of amusement abound; as also do
  clubs&mdash;political, social and sporting. Socially, indeed, the
  progress of Bucharest is remarkable, its political, literary and
  scientific circles being on a level with those of most European
  capitals.</p>

  <p>Bucharest is the winter residence of the royal family, the
  meeting-place of parliament, and the seat of an appeal court (<i>Curtea
  de Apel</i>), of the supreme court (<i>Curtea de Casatie</i>), of the
  ministries, the national bank, the bank of Rumania, many lesser credit
  establishments, and a chamber of commerce. The railway lines which meet
  on the western limit of the city give access to all parts, and the
  telephone system, besides being internally complete, communicates with
  Braila, Galatz, Jassy and Sinaia. Bucharest has a very large transit
  trade in petroleum, timber and agricultural produce; above all, in wheat
  and maize. Its industries include petroleum-refining, extraction of
  vegetable oils, cabinet-making, brandy-distilling, tanning, and the
  manufacture of machinery, wire, nails, metal-ware, cement, soap, candles,
  paste, starch, paper, cardboard, pearl buttons, textiles, leather goods,
  ropes, glucose, army supplies, preserved meat and vegetables, and
  confectionery. An important fair is held for seven days in each year. The
  mercantile community is largely composed of Austrians, Frenchmen,
  Germans, Greeks and Swiss, who form exclusive colonies. Bucharest is the
  headquarters of the II. army corps, and a fortress of the first rank. The
  fortifications were constructed in 1885-1896 on a project drafted by the
  Belgian engineer, General Brialmont, in 1883. The mean distance of the
  forts from the city is 4 m., and the perimeter of the defences (which are
  technically of special importance as embodying the system of Brialmont)
  is about 48 m., this perimeter being defended by 36 armoured forts and
  batteries. There are barracks for over 30,000 cavalry and infantry, an
  arsenal, a military hospital and three military academies.</p>

  <p>The legend of Bucur is plainly unhistorical, and the meaning of
  <i>Bucharest</i> has been much disputed. One account derives it from an
  Albanian word <i>Bukur</i>, meaning joy, in memory of a victory won by
  Prince Mircea of Walachia (c. 1383-1419) over the Turks. For this reason
  Bucharest is often called "The City of Joy". Like most ancient cities of
  Rumania, its foundation has also been ascribed to the first Walachian
  prince, the half-mythical Radu Negru (c. 1290-1314). More modern
  historians declare that it was originally a fortress, erected on the site
  of the Daco-Roman Thyanus, to command the approaches to Tîrgovishtea,
  formerly the capital of Walachia. It soon became the summer residence of
  the court. In 1595 it was burned by the Turks; but, after its
  restoration, continued to grow in size and prosperity, until, in 1698,
  Prince Constantine Brancovan chose it for his capital. During the 18th
  century the possession of Bucharest was frequently disputed by the Turks,
  Austrians and Russians. In 1812 it gave its name to the treaty by which
  Bessarabia and a third of Moldavia were ceded to Russia. In the war of
  1828 it was occupied by the Russians, who made it over to the prince of
  Walachia in the following year. A rebellion against Prince Bibescu in
  1848 brought both Turkish and Russian interference, and the city was
  again held by Russian troops in 1853-1854. On their departure an Austrian
  garrison took possession and remained till March 1857. In 1858 the
  international congress for the organization of the Danubian
  principalities was held in the city; and when, in 1861, the union of
  Walachia and Moldavia was proclaimed, Bucharest became the Rumanian
  capital. Prince Cuza, the first ruler of the united provinces, was driven
  from his throne by an insurrection in Bucharest in 1866. For the
  subsequent history of the city see <span class="sc">Rumania</span>:

  <p><b>BÜCHELER, FRANZ</b> (1837-1908), German classical scholar, was born
  in Rheinberg on the 3rd of June 1837, and educated at Bonn. He held
  professorships successively at Freiburg (1858), Greifswald (1866), and
  Bonn (1870), and in 1878 became joint-editor of the <i>Rheinisches Museum
  für Philologie</i>. Both as a teacher and as a commentator he was
  extremely successful. Among his editions are: <i>Frontini de aquis urbis
  Romae</i> (Leipzig, 1858); <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i> (Leipzig, 1859);
  <i>Petronii satirarum reliquiae</i> (Berlin, 1862; 3rd ed., 1882);
  <i>Hymnus Cereris Homericus</i> (Leipzig, 1869); <i>Q. Ciceronis

  also <i>Grundriss der lateinischen Deklination</i> (1866); <i>Das Recht
  von Gortyn</i> (Frankfort, 1885, with Zitelmann); and supervised the
  third edition (1893) of O. Jahn's <i>Persii, Juvenalis, Sulpiciae
  saturae</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BUCHER, LOTHAR</b> (1817-1892), German publicist, was born on the
  25th of October 1817 at Neu Stettin, in Pomerania, his father being
  master at a gymnasium. After studying at the university of Berlin he
  adopted the legal profession. Elected a member of the National Assembly
  in Berlin in 1848, he was an active leader of the extreme democratic
  party. With others of his colleagues he was in 1850 brought to trial for
  having taken part in organizing a movement for refusal to pay taxes; he
  was condemned to fifteen months' imprisonment in a fortress, but left the
  country before the sentence was executed. For ten years he lived in
  exile, chiefly in London; he acted as special correspondent of the
  <i>National Zeitung</i>, and gained a great knowledge of English life;
  and he published a work, <i>Der Parliamentarismus wie er ist</i>, a
  criticism of parliamentary government, which shows a marked change in his
  political opinions. In 1860 he returned to Germany, and became intimate
  with Lassalle, who made him his literary executor. In 1864 he was offered
  by Bismarck, and accepted, a high position in the Prussian foreign
  office. The reasons that led him to a step which involved so complete a
  break with his earlier friends and associations are not clearly known.
  From this time till his death he acted as Bismarck's secretary, and was
  the man who probably enjoyed the greatest <!-- Page 719 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page719"></a>[v.04 p.0719]</span>amount of his
  confidence. It was he who drew up the text of the constitution of the
  North German Confederation; in 1870 he was sent on a very confidential
  mission to Spain in connexion with the Hohenzollern candidature for the
  Spanish crown; he assisted Bismarck at the final negotiations for the
  treaty of Frankfort, and was one of the secretaries to the congress of
  Berlin; he also assisted Bismarck in the composition of his memoirs.
  Bucher, who was a man of great ability, had considerable influence, which
  was especially directed against the economic doctrines of the Liberals;
  in 1881 he published a pamphlet criticizing the influence and principles
  of the Cobden Club. He identified himself completely with Bismarck's
  later commercial and colonial policy, and probably had much to do with
  introducing it, and he did much to encourage anti-British feeling in
  Germany. He died at Glion, in Switzerland, on the 12th of October
  1892.</p>

  <p><b>BUCHEZ, PHILIPPE JOSEPH BENJAMIN</b> (1796-1865), French author and
  politician, was born on the 31st of March 1796 at Matagne-la-Petite, now
  in Belgium, then in the French department of the Ardennes. He finished
  his general education in Paris, and afterwards applied himself to the
  study of natural science and medicine. In 1821 he co-operated with
  Saint-Amand Bazard and others in founding a secret association, modelled
  on that of the Italian Carbonari, with the object of organizing a general
  armed rising against the government. The organization spread rapidly and
  widely, and displayed itself in repeated attempts at revolution. In one
  of these attempts, the affair at Belfort, Buchez was gravely compromised,
  although the jury which tried him did not find the evidence sufficient to
  warrant his condemnation. In 1825 he graduated in medicine, and soon
  after he published with Ulisse Trélat a <i>Précis élémentaire
  d'hygiène</i>. About the same time he became a member of the
  Saint-Simonian Society, presided over by Bazard, Barthélemy Prosper
  Enfantin, and Olinde Rodrigues, and contributed to its organ, the
  <i>Producteur</i>. He left it in consequence of aversion to the strange
  religious ideas developed by its "Supreme Father," Enfantin, and began to
  elaborate what he regarded as a Christian socialism. For the exposition
  and advocacy of his principles he founded a periodical called
  <i>L'Européen</i>. In 1833 he published an <i>Introduction à la science
  de l'histoire</i>, which was received with considerable favour (2nd ed.,
  improved and enlarged, 2 vols., 1842). Notwithstanding its prolixity,
  this is an interesting work. The part which treats of the aim, foundation
  and methods of the science of history is valuable; but what is most
  distinctive in Buchez's theory&mdash;the division of historical
  development into four great epochs originated by four universal
  revelations, of each epoch into three periods corresponding to desire,
  reasoning and performance, and of each of these periods into a
  theoretical and practical age&mdash;is merely ingenious (see Flint's
  <i>Philosophy of History in Europe</i>, i. 242-252). Buchez next edited,
  along with M. Roux-Lavergne (1802-1874), the <i>Histoire parlementaire de
  la Révolution française</i> (1833-1838; 40 vols.). This vast and
  conscientious publication is a valuable store of material for the early
  periods of the first French Revolution. There is a review of it by
  Carlyle (<i>Miscellanies</i>), the first two parts of whose own history
  of the French Revolution are mainly drawn from it. The editors worked
  under the inspiration of a strong admiration of the principles of
  Robespierre and the Jacobins, and in the belief that the French
  Revolution was an attempt to realize Christianity. In the <i>Essai d'un
  traité complet de philosophie au point de vue du Catholicisme et du
  progrès</i> (1839-1840) Buchez endeavoured to co-ordinate in a single
  system the political, moral, religious and natural phenomena of
  existence. Denying the possibility of innate ideas, he asserted that
  morality comes by revelation, and is therefore not only certain, but the
  only real certainty.</p>

  <p>It was partly owing to the reputation which he had acquired by these
  publications, but still more owing to his connexion with the
  <i>National</i> newspaper, and with the secret societies hostile to the
  government of Louis Philippe, that he was raised, by the Revolution of
  1848, to the presidency of the Constituent Assembly. He speedily showed
  that he was not possessed of the qualities needed in a situation so
  difficult and in days so tempestuous. He retained the position only for a
  very short time. After the dissolution of the assembly he was not
  re-elected. Thrown back into private life, he resumed his studies, and
  added several works to those which have been already mentioned. A
  <i>Traité de politique</i> (published 1866), which may be considered as
  the completion of his <i>Traité de philosophie</i>, was the most
  important of the productions of the last period of his life. His
  brochures are very numerous and on a great variety of subjects, medical,
  historical, political, philosophical, &amp;c. He died on the 12th of
  August 1865. He found a disciple of considerable ability in M.A. Ott, who
  advocated and applied his principles in various writings.</p>

  <p><b>BÜCHNER, FRIEDRICH KARL CHRISTIAN LUDWIG</b> (1824-1899), German
  philosopher and physician, was born at Darmstadt. He studied at Giessen,
  Strassburg, Würzburg and Vienna. In 1852 he became lecturer in medicine
  at the university of Tübingen, where he published his great work <i>Kraft
  und Stoff</i> (1855). In this work, the product, according to Lange, of a
  fanatical enthusiasm for humanity, he sought to demonstrate the
  indestructibility of matter and force, and the finality of physical
  force. The extreme materialism of this work excited so much opposition
  that he was compelled to give up his post at Tübingen. He retired to
  Darmstadt, where he practised as a physician and contributed regularly to
  pathological and physiological magazines. He continued his philosophical
  work in defence of materialism, and published <i>Natur und Geist</i>
  (1857), <i>Aus Natur und Wissenschaft</i> (vol. i., 1862; vol. ii.,
  1884), <i>Fremdes und Eigenes aus dem geistigen Leben der Gegenwart</i>
  (1890), <i>Darwinismus und Socialismus</i> (1894), <i>Im Dienste der
  Wahrheit</i> (1899). He died at Darmstadt on the 1st of May 1899. In
  estimating Büchner's philosophy it must be remembered that he was
  primarily a physiologist, not a metaphysician. Matter and force (or
  energy) are infinite; the conservation of force follows from the
  imperishability of matter, the ultimate basis of all science. Büchner is
  not always clear in his theory of the relation between matter and force.
  At one time he refuses to explain it, but generally he assumes that all
  natural and spiritual forces are indwelling in matter. "Just as a
  steam-engine," he says in <i>Kraft und Stoff</i> (7th ed., p. 130),
  "produces motion, so the intricate organic complex of force-bearing
  substance in an animal organism produces a total sum of certain effects,
  which, when bound together in a unity, are called by us mind, soul,
  thought." Here he postulates force and mind as emanating from original
  matter&mdash;a materialistic monism. But in other parts of his works he
  suggests that mind and matter are two different aspects of that which is
  the basis of all things&mdash;a monism which is not necessarily
  materialistic, and which, in the absence of further explanation,
  constitutes a confession of failure. Büchner was much less concerned to
  establish a scientific metaphysic than to protest against the romantic
  idealism of his predecessors and the theological interpretations of the
  universe. Nature according to him is purely physical; it has no purpose,
  no will, no laws imposed by extraneous authority, no supernatural ethical
  sanction.</p>

  <p><b>BUCHON, JEAN ALEXANDRE</b> (1791-1849), French scholar, was born on
  the 21st of May 1791 at Menetou-Salon (Cher), and died on the 29th of
  August 1849. An ardent Liberal, he took an active part in party struggles
  under the Restoration, while <!-- Page 720 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page720"></a>[v.04 p.0720]</span>throwing himself with equal vigour
  into the great work of historical regeneration which was going on at that
  period. During 1822 and the succeeding years he travelled about Europe on
  the search for materials for his <i>Collection des chroniques nationales
  françaises écrites en langue vulgaire du XIII<sup>e</sup> au
  XVI<sup>e</sup> siècle</i> (47 vols., 1824-1829). After the revolution of
  1830 he founded the <i>Panthéon litteraire</i>, in which he published a
  <i>Choix d'ouvrages mystiques</i> (1843), a <i>Choix de monuments
  primitifs de l'église chrétienne</i> (1837), a <i>Choix des historiens
  grecs</i> (1837), a collection of <i>Chroniques étrangères relatives aux
  expéditions françaises pendant le XIII<sup>e</sup> siècle</i> (1840),
  and, most important of all, a <i>Choix de chroniques et mémoires sur
  l'histoire de France</i> (1836-1841). His travels in southern Italy and
  in the East had put him upon the track of the medieval French settlements
  in those regions, and to this subject he devoted several important works:
  <i>Recherches et matériaux pour servir a une histoire de la domination
  française dans les provinces démembrées de l'empire grec</i> (1840);
  <i>Nouvelles recherches historiques sur la principauté française de Morée
  et ses hautes baronnies</i> (2 vols., 1843-1844); <i>Histoire des
  conquêtes et de l'établissement des Français dans les états de l'ancienne
  Grèce sous es Villehardouin</i> (1846, unfinished). None of the numerous
  publications which we owe to Buchon can be described as thoroughly
  scholarly; but they have been of great service to history, and those
  concerning the East have in especial the value of original research.</p>

  <p><b>BUCHU,</b> or <span class="sc">Buka Leaves</span>, the produce of
  several shrubby plants belonging to the genus Barosma (nat. order
  Rutaceae), natives of the Cape of Good Hope. The principal species, <i>B.
  crenulata</i>, has leaves of a smooth leathery texture, oblong-ovate in
  shape, from an inch to an inch and a half in length, with serrulate or
  crenulate margins, on which as well as on the under side are conspicuous
  oil-glands. The other species which yield buchu are <i>B.
  serratifolia</i>, having linear-lanceolate sharply serrulate leaves, and
  <i>B. betulina</i>, the leaves of which are cuneate-obovate, with
  denticulate margins. They are all, as found in commerce, of a pale
  yellow-green colour; they emit a peculiar aromatic odour, and have a
  slightly astringent bitter taste. Buchu leaves contain a volatile oil,
  which is of a dark yellow colour, and deposits a form of camphor on
  exposure to air, a liquid hydro-carbon being the solvent of the camphor
  within the oil-glands. There is also present a minute quantity of a
  bitter principle. The leaves of a closely allied plant, <i>Empleurum
  serratulum</i>, are employed as a substitute or adulterant for buchu. As
  these possess no glands they are a worthless substitute. The British
  Pharmacopoeia contains an infusion and tincture of buchu. The former may
  be given in doses of an ounce and the latter in doses of a drachm. The
  drug has the properties common to all substances that contain a volatile
  oil. The infusion contains very little of the oil and is of very slight
  value. Until the advent of the modern synthetic products buchu was valued
  in diseases of the urinary tract, but its use is now practically
  obsolete.</p>

  <p><b>BUCK, CARL DARLING</b> (1866- ), American philologist, was born on
  the 2nd of October 1866, at Bucksport, Maine. He graduated at Yale in
  1886, was a graduate student there for three years, and studied at the
  American School of Classical Studies in Athens (1887-1889) and in Leipzig
  (1889-1892). In 1892 he became professor of Sanskrit and Indo-European
  comparative philology in the University of Chicago; but it is in the
  narrower field of the Italic dialects that his important work lies,
  including <i>Der Vocalismus der oskischen Sprache</i> (1892), <i>The
  Oscan-Umbrian Verb-System</i> (1895), and <i>Grammar of Oscan and
  Umbrian</i> (1904), as well as an excellent <i>précis</i> of the Italic
  languages in <i>Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia</i>. He collaborated with
  W.G. Hale (<i>q.v.</i>) in the preparation of <i>A Latin Grammar</i>
  (1903). Of his contributions to reviews on phonological topics, perhaps
  the most important is his discussion of "Brugmann's Law."</p>

  talents; and for four years (1858-1862) he studied at Leipzig, Dresden
  and Paris. On returning to America he held the position of organist at
  Hartford, Chicago (1869), and Boston (1871). In 1875 he went to New York
  to assist Theodore Thomas as conductor of the orchestral concerts, and
  from 1877 to 1903 was organist at Holy Trinity church. Meanwhile he had
  become well known as a composer of church music, a number of cantatas
  (<i>Columbus</i>, 1876; <i>Golden Legend</i>, 1880; <i>Light of Asia</i>,
  1885, &amp;c), a grand opera, <i>Serapis</i>, a comic opera,

  <i>bok-wagen</i>) is a South African cart with a frame projecting over
  the wheels, used for the transport of heavy loads. (4) (Either from
  "buck" a he-goat, or from a common Teutonic root, to bend, as seen in the
  Ger. <i>bücken</i>, and Eng. "bow"), a verb meaning "to leap"; seen
  especially in the compound "buck-jumper," a horse which leaps clear off
  the ground, with feet tucked together and arched back, descending with
  fore-feet rigid and head down and drawn inwards.</p>

  <p><b>BUCK-BEAN,</b> or <span class="sc">Bog-Bean</span> (<i>Menyanthes
  trifoliata</i>, a member of the Gentian family), a bog-plant with a

  leaflets, and spikes of white or pink flowers. The stout stem is bitter
  and has tonic and febrifuge properties. The plant is widely distributed
  through the north temperate zone.</p>

  <p><b>BÜCKEBURG,</b> a town of Germany, capital of the principality of
  Schaumburg-Lippe, pleasantly situated at the foot of the Harrelberg on
  the river Aue, 6 m. from Minden, on the main railway from Cologne to
  Berlin. Pop. 6000. It has a palace standing in extensive grounds, a
  gymnasium, a normal seminary, a library, a synagogue, and three churches,
  one of which has the appropriate inscription, <i>Religionis non
  structurae exemplum</i>. The first houses of Bückeburg began to gather
  round the castle about 1365; and it was not till the 17th century that
  the town was surrounded with walls, which have given place to a ring of
  pretty promenades. The poet J.G. von Herder was court preacher here from
  1771 to 1776.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKERIDGE, JOHN</b> (c. 1562-1631), English divine, was a son of
  William Buckeridge, and was educated at the Merchant Taylors school and
  at St John's College, Oxford. He became a fellow of his college, and
  acted as tutor to William Laud, whose opinions were perhaps shaped by
  him. Leaving Oxford, Buckeridge held several livings, and was highly
  esteemed by King James I., whose chaplain he became. In 1605 he was
  elected president of St John's College, a position which he vacated on
  being made bishop of Rochester in 1611. He was transferred to the
  bishopric of Ely in 1628, and died on the 23rd of May 1631. The bishop
  won some fame as a theologian and a controversialist. Among his intimate
  friends was Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, whose "Ninety-one Sermons" were
  published by Laud and Buckeridge in 1629.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKETSHOP,</b> a slang financial term for the office or business
  of an inferior class of stockbroker, who is not a member of an official
  exchange and conducts speculative operations for his clients, who deposit
  a margin or cover. The operations consist, as a rule, of a simple bet or
  wager between the broker and client, no pretence of an actual purchase or
  sale being attempted. The term is sometimes, though loosely and
  wrongfully, applied to <!-- Page 721 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page721"></a>[v.04 p.0721]</span>all stockbrokers who are not
  members of the recognized local exchange. The origin of the word is
  American. According to the <i>New English Dictionary</i> it is supposed
  to have arisen in Chicago. The Board of Trade there forbade dealings in
  "options" in grain of less than 5000 bushels. An "Open Board of Trade" or
  unauthorized exchange was opened, for the purpose of small gamblers, in a
  neighbouring street below the rooms of the Board of Trade. The lift used
  by members of the Board of Trade would be sent down to bring up from the
  open Board what was known as a "bucketful" of the smaller speculators,
  when business was slack.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKHOLDT</b> [properly <span class="sc">Beukelsz</span>, or <span
  class="sc">Bockelszoon</span>], <b>JOHANN</b> (<i>c.</i> 1508-1535),
  Dutch Anabaptist fanatic, better known as <span class="sc">John of
  Leiden</span>, from his place of birth, was the illegitimate son of
  Bockel, burgomaster of Soevenhagen, who afterwards married his mother. He
  was born about 1508, apprenticed to a tailor, became infected with the
  opinions of Thomas Münzer, travelled in pursuit of his trade (being four
  years in London), married a widow, became bankrupt, and in September 1533
  joined the Anabaptist movement under Johann Matthysz (Matthyszoon), baker
  of Haarlem. He had little education, but some literary faculty, and had
  written plays. On the 13th of January 1534 he appeared in Münster as an
  apostle of Matthysz. Good-looking and fluent, he fascinated women, and
  won the confidence of Bernard Knipperdollinck, a revolutionary cloth
  merchant, who gave him his daughter in marriage. The Münster Anabaptists
  took up arms on the 9th of February 1534 (see <span
  class="sc">Anabaptists</span>). On the death of Matthysz (1534),
  Buckholdt succeeded him as prophet, added his widow to the number of his
  wives, and organized a new constitution for Münster, with twelve elders
  (suggested by the tribes of Israel) and other officers of a theocracy,
  but soon superseded these, making himself king of the new Zion. His
  arbitrary rule was marked by pomp and severity. Münster was retaken (June
  25, 1535) by its prince-bishop, Franz von Waldeck. Buckholdt, after many
  indignities, was cruelly executed on the 22nd of January 1536; his body,
  and those of his companions, were hung in cages to the tower of the
  Lamberti church. His portrait is in <i>Grouwelen der Hooftketteren</i>
  (Leiden, 1607; an English edition is appended to Alexander Ross's
  <i>Pansebeia</i>, 2nd ed., 1655); a better example of the same is given

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM, EARLS, MARQUESSES AND DUKES OF.</b> The origin of the
  earldom of Buckingham (to be distinguished from that of Buckinghamshire,
  <i>q.v.</i>) is obscure. According to Mr J.H. Round (in G.E.C.'s
  <i>Peerage</i>, <i>s.v.</i>) there is some charter evidence for its
  existence under William Rufus; but the main evidence for reckoning Walter
  Giffard, lord of Longueville in Normandy, who held forty-eight lordships
  in the county, as the first earl, is that of Odericus Vitalis, who twice
  describes Walter as "Comes Bucchingehamensis," once in 1097, and again at
  his death in 1102. After the death of Walter Giffard, 2nd earl in 1164,
  the title was assumed by Richard de Clare, earl of Pembroke
  ("Strongbow"), in right of his wife, Rohais, sister of Walter Giffard I.;
  and it died with him in 1176. In 1377 Thomas of "Woodstock" (duke of
  Gloucester) was created earl of Buckingham at the coronation of Richard
  II. (15th of July), and the title of Gloucester having after his death
  been given to Thomas le Despenser, his son Humphrey bore that of earl of
  Buckingham only. On Humphrey's death, his sister Anne became countess of
  Buckingham in her own right. She married Edmund Stafford, earl of
  Stafford, and on her death (1438) the title of Buckingham passed to her
  son Humphrey Stafford, earl of Stafford, who in 1444 was created duke of
  Buckingham. This title remained in the Stafford family until the
  attainder and execution of Edward, 3rd duke, in 1521 (see <span
  class="sc">Buckingham, Henry Stafford</span>, 2nd duke of).</p>

  <p>In 1617 King James I. created George Villiers earl, in 1618 marquess,
  and in 1623 duke of Buckingham (see <span class="sc">Buckingham, George
  Villiers</span>, 1st duke of). The marquessate and dukedom became extinct
  with the death of the 2nd (Villiers) duke (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1687; but the
  earldom was claimed, under the special remainder in the patent of 1617,
  by a collateral line of doubtful legitimacy claiming descent from John
  Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck. The title was not actually borne after
  the death of John Villiers, styling himself earl of Buckingham, in 1723.
  The claim was extinguished by the death of George Villiers, a clergyman,
  in 1774.</p>

  <p>In 1703 John Sheffield, marquess of Normanby, was created "duke of the
  county of Buckingham and of Normanby" (see below). He was succeeded by
  his son Edmund who died in October 1735 when the titles became
  extinct.</p>

  <p>The title of marquess and duke of Buckingham in the Grenville family
  (to the holders of which the remainder of this article applies) was
  derived, not from the county, but from the town of Buckingham. It
  originated in 1784, when the 2nd Earl Temple was created marquess of
  Buckingham "in the county of Buckingham," this title being elevated into
  the dukedom of Buckingham and Chandos for his son in 1822.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">George Nugent Temple Grenville</span>, 1st marquess
  of Buckingham (1753-1813), was the second son of George Grenville, and
  was born on the 17th of June 1753. Educated at Eton and Christ Church,
  Oxford, he was appointed a teller of the exchequer in 1764, and ten years
  later was returned to parliament as one of the members for
  Buckinghamshire. In the House of Commons he was a sharp critic of the
  American policy of Lord North. In September 1779 he succeeded his uncle
  as 2nd Earl Temple; in 1782 was appointed lord-lieutenant of
  Buckinghamshire; and in July of the same year became a member of the
  privy council and lord-lieutenant of Ireland in the ministry of the earl
  of Shelburne. On his advice the Renunciation Act of 1783 was passed,
  which supplemented the legislative independence granted to Ireland in
  1782. By royal warrant he created the order of St Patrick in February
  1783, with himself as the first grand master. Temple left Ireland in
  1783, and again turned his attention to English politics. He enjoyed the
  confidence of George III., and having opposed Fox's East India Bill, he
  was authorized by the king to say that "whoever voted for the India Bill
  was not only not his friend, but would be considered by him as an enemy,"
  a message which ensured the defeat of the bill. He was appointed a
  secretary of state when the younger Pitt formed his ministry in December
  1783, but resigned two days later. In December 1784 he was created
  marquess of Buckingham "in the county of Buckingham." In November 1787 he
  was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland under Pitt, but his second
  tenure of this office was hardly as successful as the first. He was
  denounced by Grattan for extravagance; was censured by the Irish Houses
  of parliament for refusing to transmit to England in address calling upon
  the prince of Wales to assume the regency; and he could only maintain his
  position by resorting to bribery on a large scale. Having become very
  unpopular he resigned his office in September 1789, and subsequently took
  very little part in politics, although he spoke in favour of the union
  with Ireland. He died at his residence, Stowe House, <!-- Page 722
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page722"></a>[v.04
  p.0722]</span>Buckingham, on the 11th of February 1813, and was buried at
  Wotton. In 1775 he had married Mary Elizabeth (d. 1812), daughter of
  Robert, Earl Nugent.</p>

  <p>His elder son, <span class="sc">Richard Grenville</span>, 1st duke of
  Buckingham and Chandos (1776-1839), was one of the members of parliament
  for Buckinghamshire from 1797 to 1813, and, as Earl Temple, took an
  active part in politics. In February 1813 he succeeded his father as
  marquess of Buckingham; and having married the only child of the 3rd duke
  of Chandos, he was created duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1822. He
  died in 1839. Owing to financial embarrassments, the duke lived out of
  England for some time, and in 1862 an account of his travels was
  published, as <i>The Private Diary of Richard, Duke of Buckingham and
  Chandos</i>.</p>

  <p>He was succeeded by his only child, <span class="sc">Richard
  Grenville</span>, 2nd duke of Buckingham and Chandos (1797-1861).
  Educated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford, he was known as Earl Temple
  and subsequently as marquess of Chandos. He was member of parliament for
  Buckinghamshire from 1818 to 1839, and was responsible for the "Chandos
  clause" in the Reform Bill of 1832. He was lord privy seal from September
  1841 to January 1842, and partly owing to his opposition to the repeal of
  the corn laws was known as the "Farmers' Friend." He found the estates
  heavily encumbered when he succeeded to the dukedom in 1839, and his own
  generous and luxurious tastes brought matters to a climax. In 1847 his
  residences were seized by his creditors, and the duke left England. His
  personal property and many of his landed estates were sold, and returning
  to England he devoted himself to literature. He died in London, on the
  29th of July 1861. His wife, whom he married in 1819, was Mary (d. 1862),
  daughter of John, 1st marquess of Breadalbane, and she obtained a divorce
  from him in 1850. Buckingham's chief publications are, <i>Memoirs of the
  Court and Cabinets of George III.</i> (London, 1853-1855); <i>Memoirs of
  the Court of England</i>, 1811-1820 (London, 1856); <i>Memoirs of the
  Court of George IV.</i> (London, 1859); and <i>Memoirs of the Court and
  Cabinets of William IV. and Victoria</i> (London, 1861).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Richard Grenville</span>, 3rd duke of Buckingham and
  Chandos (1823-1889), the only son of the 2nd duke, was educated at Eton
  and Christ Church, Oxford, and, as marquess of Chandos, represented the
  borough of Buckingham in parliament from 1846 to 1857. He was chairman of
  the London &amp; North-Western railway from 1853 to 1861. After
  succeeding to the dukedom he became lord president of the council, and
  subsequently secretary for the colonies in the Conservative government of
  1866-1868. From 1875 to 1880 he was governor of Madras, and in 1886 was
  chosen chairman of committees in the House of Lords. He was twice married
  and left three daughters. As he left no son the dukedom became extinct on
  his death; but the Scottish barony of Kinloss (to which he established
  his title in 1868) passed to his eldest daughter, Mary, the wife of
  Captain L. F. H. C. Morgan; the earldom of Temple to his nephew, William
  Stephen Gore-Langton; and the viscounty of Cobham to his kinsman, Charles
  George, 5th Baron Lyttelton. His widow married the 1st Earl Egerton of
  Tatton in 1894.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM, GEORGE VILLIERS,</b> <span class="sc">1st Duke
  of</span><a name="FnAnchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  (1592-1628), English statesman, born in August 1592,<a
  name="FnAnchor_252" href="#Footnote_252"><sup>[2]</sup></a> was a younger
  son of Sir George Villiers of Brooksby. His mother, Mary, daughter of
  Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire, who was left a widow
  early, educated him for a courtier's life, sending him to France with Sir
  John Eliot; and the lad, being "by nature contemplative," took kindly to
  the training. He could dance well, fence well, and talk a little French,
  when in August 1614 he was brought before the king's notice, in the hope
  that he would take a fancy to him.</p>

  <p>The moment was favourable. Since Salisbury's death James had taken the
  business of government upon himself. But he wanted some one who would
  chat with him, and amuse him, and would also fill the office of private
  secretary, and save him from the trouble of saying no to importunate
  suitors. It would be an additional satisfaction if he could train the
  youth whom he might select in those arts of statesmanship of which he
  believed himself to be a perfect master. His first choice had not proved
  a happy one. Robert Carr, who had lately become earl of Somerset, had had
  his head turned by his elevation. He had grown peevish toward his master,
  and had placed himself at the head of the party which was working for a
  close alliance with Spain.</p>

  <p>The appearance of Villiers, beaming with animal spirits and good
  humour, was therefore welcomed by all who had an interest in opposing the
  designs of Spain, and he was appointed cupbearer the same year. For some
  little time still Somerset's pre-eminence was maintained. But on the 23rd
  of April 1615, Villiers, in spite of Somerset, was promoted to be
  gentleman of the bedchamber, and was knighted on the 24th; the charge of
  murdering Overbury, brought against Somerset in September, completed his
  downfall, and Villiers at once stepped into the place which he had
  vacated. On the 3rd of January 1616 he became master of the horse, on the
  24th of April he received the order of the Garter, and on the 27th of
  August 1616 was created Viscount Villiers and Baron Waddon, receiving a
  grant of land valued at £80,000, while on the 5th of January 1617 he was
  made earl, and on the 1st of January 1618 marquess of Buckingham. With
  the exception of the earl of Pembroke he was the richest nobleman in
  England.</p>

  <p>Those who expected him to give his support to the anti-Spanish party
  were at first doomed to disappointment. As yet he was no politician, and
  he contented himself with carrying out his master's orders, whatever they
  were. In his personal relations he was kindly and jovial towards all who
  did not thwart his wishes. But James had taught him to consider that the
  patronage of England was in his hands, and he took good care that no man
  should receive promotion of any kind who did not in one way or another
  pay court to him. As far as can be ascertained, he cared less for money
  than for the gratification of his vanity. But he had not merely himself
  to consider. His numerous kinsfolk were to be enriched by marriage, if in
  no other way, and Bacon, the great philosopher and statesman, was all but
  thrust from office because he had opposed a marriage suggested for one of
  Buckingham's brothers, while Cranfield, the first financier of the day,
  was kept from the treasury till he would forsake the woman whom he loved,
  to marry a penniless cousin of the favourite. On the 19th of January 1619
  James made him lord high admiral of England, hoping that the ardent,
  energetic youth would impart something of his own fire to those who were
  entrusted with the oversight of that fleet which had been almost ruined
  by the peculation and carelessness of the officials. Something of this,
  no doubt, was realized under Buckingham's eye. But he himself never
  pretended to the virtues of an administrator, and he was too ready to
  fill up appointments with men who flattered him, and too reluctant to
  dismiss them, if they served their country ill, to effect any permanent
  change for the better.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that he first took an independent part in
  politics. All England was talking of the revolution in Bohemia in the
  year before, and men's sympathy with the continental Protestants was
  increased when it was known that James's son-in-law had accepted the
  crown of Bohemia, and that in the summer of 1620 a Spanish force was
  preparing to invade the Palatinate. Buckingham at first had thrown
  himself into the popular movement. Before the summer of 1620 was at end,
  incensed by injuries inflicted on English sailors by the Dutch in the
  East Indies, he had swung round, and was in close agreement with
  Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador. He had now married Lady Katherine
  Manners, the daughter of the earl of Rutland, who was at heart a Roman
  Catholic, though she outwardly conformed to the English Church, and this
  alliance may have had something to do with the change.</p>

  <p>Buckingham's mistakes were owing mainly to his levity. If he passed
  briskly from one camp to the other, an impartial <!-- Page 723 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page723"></a>[v.04 p.0723]</span>observer might
  usually detect some personal motive at the bottom. But it is hardly
  probable that he was himself conscious of anything of the sort. When he
  was in reality acting under the influence of vanity or passion it was
  easy for him to persuade himself that he was doing his duty to his
  country.</p>

  <p>The parliament which met in 1621, angry at discovering that no help
  was to be sent to the Palatinate, broke out into a loud outcry against
  the system of monopolies, from which Buckingham's brothers and dependants
  had drawn a profit, which was believed to be greater than it really was.
  At first he pleaded for a dissolution. But he was persuaded by Bishop
  Williams that it would be a wiser course to put himself at the head of
  the movement, and at a conference of the Commons with the Lords
  acknowledged that his two brothers had been implicated, but declared that
  his father had begotten a third who would aid in punishing them. In the
  impeachment of Bacon which soon followed, Buckingham, who owed much to
  his wise counsels, gave him that assistance which was possible without
  imperilling his own position and influence. He at first demanded the
  immediate dissolution of parliament, but afterwards, when the cry rose
  louder against the chancellor, joined in the attack, making however some
  attempt to mitigate the severity of the charges against him during the
  hearing of his case before the House of Lords. Notwithstanding, he took
  advantage of Bacon's need of assistance to wring from him the possession
  of York House.</p>

  <p>In the winter of 1621, and the succeeding year, Buckingham was
  entirely in Gondomar's hands; and it was only with some difficulty that
  in May 1622 Laud argued him out of a resolution to declare himself a
  Roman Catholic. In December 1621 he actively supported the dissolution of
  parliament, and there can be little doubt that when the Spanish
  ambassador left England the following May, he had come to an
  understanding with Buckingham that the prince of Wales should visit
  Madrid the next year, on which occasion the Spanish court hoped to effect
  his conversion to the Roman Catholic Church before giving him the hand of
  the infanta Maria. They set out on their adventurous expedition on the
  17th of February 1623, arriving at Madrid, after passing through Paris on
  the 7th of March. Each party had been the dupe of the other. Charles and
  Buckingham were sanguine in hoping for the restitution of the Palatinate
  to James's son-in-law, as a marriage gift to Charles; while the Spaniards
  counted on the conversion of Charles to Roman Catholicism and other
  extreme concessions (see <span class="sc">Charles I</span>.). The
  political differences were soon accentuated by personal disputes between
  Buckingham and Olivares and the grandees, and when the two young men
  sailed together from Santander in September, it was with the final
  resolution to break entirely with Spain.</p>

  <p>James had gratified his favourite in his absence by raising him to a
  dukedom. But the splendour which now gathered round Buckingham was owing
  to another source than James's favour. He had put himself at the head of
  the popular movement against Spain, and when James, acknowledging sorely
  against his will that the Palatinate could only be recovered by force,
  summoned the parliament which met in February 1624, Buckingham, with the
  help of the heir apparent, took up an independent political position.
  James was half driven, half persuaded to declare all negotiations with
  Spain at an end. For the moment Buckingham was the most popular man in
  England.</p>

  <p>It was easier to overthrow one policy than to construct another. The
  Commons would have been content with sending some assistance to the
  Dutch, and with entering upon a privateering war with Spain. James, whose
  object was to regain the Palatinate, believed this could only be
  accomplished by a continental alliance, in which France took part. As
  soon as parliament was prorogued, negotiations were opened for a marriage
  between Charles and the sister of Louis XIII., Henrietta Maria. But a
  difficulty arose. James and Charles had engaged to the Commons that there
  should be no concessions to the English Roman Catholics, and Louis would
  not hear of the marriage unless very large concessions were made.
  Buckingham, impatient to begin the war as soon as possible, persuaded
  Charles, and the two together persuaded James to throw over the promises
  to the Commons, and to accept the French terms. It was no longer possible
  to summon parliament to vote supplies for the war till the marriage had
  been completed, when remonstrances to its conditions would be
  useless.</p>

  <p>Buckingham, for Buckingham was now virtually the ruler of England, had
  thus to commence war without money. He prepared to throw 12,000
  Englishmen, under a German adventurer, Count Mansfeld, through France
  into the Palatinate. The French insisted that he should maroh through
  Holland. It mattered little which way he took. Without provisions, and
  without money to buy them, the wretched troops sickened and died in the
  winter frosts. Buckingham's first military enterprise ended in disastrous
  failure.</p>

  <p>Buckingham had many other schemes in his teeming brain. He had offered
  to send aid to Christian IV., king of Denmark, who was proposing to make
  war in Germany, and had also a plan for sending an English fleet to
  attack Genoa, the ally of Spain, and a plan for sending an English fleet
  to attack Spain itself.</p>

  <p>Before these schemes could be carried into operation James died on the
  27th of March 1625. The new king and Buckingham were at one in their aims
  and objects. Both were anxious to distinguish themselves by the
  chastisement of Spain, and the recovery of the Palatinate. Both were
  young and inexperienced. But Charles, obstinate when his mind was made
  up, was sluggish in action and without fertility in ideas, and he had
  long submitted his mind to the versatile and brilliant favourite, who was
  never at a loss what to do next, and who unrolled before his eyes visions
  of endless possibilities in the future. Buckingham was sent over to Paris
  to urge upon the French court the importance of converting its alliance
  into active co-operation.</p>

  <p>There was a difficulty in the way. The Huguenots of La Rochelle were
  in rebellion, and James had promised the aid of English ships to suppress
  that rebellion. Buckingham, who seems at first to have consented to the
  scheme, was anxious to mediate peace between the king of France and his
  subjects, and to save Charles from compromising himself with his
  parliament by the appearance of English ships in an attack upon
  Protestants. When he returned his main demands were refused, but hopes
  were given him that peace would be made with the Huguenots. On his way
  through France he had the insolence to make love to the queen of
  France.</p>

  <p>Soon after his return parliament was opened. It would have been hard
  for Charles to pass through the session with credit. Under Buckingham's
  guidance he had entered into engagements involving an enormous
  expenditure, and these engagements involved a war on the continent, which
  had never been popular in the House of Commons. The Commons, too,
  suspected the marriage treaty contained engagements of which they
  disapproved. They asked for the full execution of the laws against the
  Roman Catholics, and voted but little money in return. Before they
  reassembled at Oxford on the 1st of August, the English ships had found
  their way into the hands of the French, to be used against La Rochelle.
  The Commons met in an ill-humour. They had no confidence in Buckingham,
  and they asked that persons whom they could trust should be admitted to
  the king's council before they would vote a penny. Charles stood by his
  minister, and on the 12th of August he dissolved his first
  parliament.</p>

  <p>Buckingham and his master set themselves to work to conquer public
  opinion. On the one hand, they threw over their engagements to France on
  behalf of the English Roman Catholics. On the other hand they sent out a
  large fleet to attack Cadiz, and to seize the Spanish treasure-ships.
  Buckingham went to the Hague to raise an immediate supply by pawning the
  crown jewels, to place England at the head of a great Protestant
  alliance, and to enter into fresh obligations to furnish money to the
  king of Denmark. It all ended in failure. The fleet returned from Cadiz,
  having effected nothing. The crown jewels produced but a small sum, and
  the money for the king of Denmark could only be raised by an appeal to
  parliament. In the meanwhile the king of France was deeply offended by
  the treatment of <!-- Page 724 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page724"></a>[v.04 p.0724]</span>the Roman Catholics, and by the
  seizure of French vessels on the ground that they were engaged in
  carrying goods for Spain.</p>

  <p>When Charles's second parliament met on the 6th of February 1626, it
  was not long before, under Eliot's guidance, it asked for Buckingham's
  punishment. He was impeached before the House of Lords on a long string
  of charges. Many of these charges were exaggerated, and some were untrue.
  His real crime was his complete failure as the leader of the
  administration. But as long as Charles refused to listen to the
  complaints of his minister's incompetency, the only way in which the
  Commons could reach him was by bringing criminal charges against him.
  Charles dissolved his second parliament as he had dissolved his first.
  Subsequently the Star Chamber declared the duke innocent of the charges,
  and on the 1st of June Buckingham was elected chancellor of Cambridge
  University.</p>

  <p>To find money was the great difficulty. Recourse was had to a forced
  loan, and men were thrown into prison for refusing to pay it. Disasters
  had occurred to Charles's allies in Germany. The fleet sent out under
  Lord Willoughby (earl of Lindsey) against the Spaniards returned home
  shattered by a storm, and a French war was impending in addition to the
  Spanish one. The French were roused to reprisals by Charles's persistence
  in seizing French vessels. Unwilling to leave La Rochelle open to the
  entrance of an English fleet, Richelieu laid siege to that stronghold of
  the French Huguenots. On the 27th of June 1627 Buckingham sailed from
  Portsmouth at the head of a numerous fleet, and a considerable land
  force, to relieve the besieged city.</p>

  <p>His first enterprise was the siege of the fort of St Martin's, on the
  Isle of Ré. The ground was hard, and the siege operations were converted
  into a blockade. On the 27th of September the defenders of the fort
  announced their readiness to surrender the next morning. In the night a
  fresh gale brought over a flotilla of French provision boats, which
  dashed through the English blockading squadron. The fort was provisioned
  for two months more. Buckingham resolved to struggle on, and sent for
  reinforcements from England. Charles would gladly have answered to his
  call. But England had long since ceased to care for the war. There was no
  money in the exchequer, no enthusiasm in the nation to supply the want.
  Before the reinforcements could arrive the French had thrown a superior
  force upon the island, and Buckingham was driven to retreat on the 29th
  of October with heavy loss, only 2989 troops out of nearly 7000 returning
  to England.</p>

  <p>His spirits were as buoyant as ever. Ill luck, or the misconduct of
  others, was the cause of his failure. He had new plans for carrying on
  the war. But the parliament which met on the 17th of March 1628 was
  resolved to exact from the king an obligation to refrain from encroaching
  for the future on the liberties of his subjects.</p>

  <p>In the parliamentary battle, which ended in the concession of the
  Petition of Right, Buckingham took an active share as a member of the
  House of Lords. He resisted as long as it was possible to resist the
  demand of the Commons, that the king should abandon his claim to imprison
  without showing cause. When the first unsatisfactory answer to the
  petition was made by the king on the 2nd of June, the Commons suspected,
  probably with truth, that it had been dictated by Buckingham. They
  prepared a remonstrance on the state of the nation, and Coke at last
  named the duke as the cause of all the misfortunes that had occurred.
  "The duke of Bucks is the cause of all our miseries ... that man is the
  grievance of grievances." Though on the 7th of June the king granted a
  satisfactory answer to the petition, the Commons proceeded with their
  remonstrance, and on the 11th demanded that he might no longer continue
  in office.</p>

  <p>Once more Charles refused to surrender Buckingham, and a few days
  later he prorogued parliament in anger. The popular feeling was greatly
  excited. Lampoons circulated freely from hand to hand, and Dr Lambe, a
  quack doctor, who dabbled in astrology, and was believed to exercise
  influence over Buckingham, was murdered in the streets of London. Rude
  doggerel lines announced that the duke should share the doctor's
  fate.</p>

  <p>With the clouds gathering round him, Buckingham went down to
  Portsmouth to take the command of one final expedition for the relief of
  La Rochelle. For the first time even he was beginning to acknowledge that
  he had undertaken a task beyond his powers. There was a force of inertia
  in the officials which resisted his efforts to spur them on to an
  enterprise which they believed to be doomed to failure. He entered gladly
  into a scheme of pacification proposed by the Venetian ambassador. But
  before he could know whether there was to be peace or war, the knife of
  an assassin put an end to his career. John Felton, who had served at Ré,
  had been disappointed of promotion, and had not been paid that which was
  due to him for his services, read the declaration of the Commons that
  Buckingham was a public enemy, and eagerly caught at the excuse for
  revenging his private wrongs under cover of those of his country.
  Waiting, on the morning of the 23rd of August, beside the door of the
  room in which Buckingham was breakfasting, he stabbed him to the heart as
  he came out.</p>

  <p>Buckingham married Lady Katherine Manners, daughter of Francis, 6th
  earl of Rutland, by whom he left three sons and one daughter, of whom
  George, the second son (1628-1687), succeeded to the dukedom.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM, GEORGE VILLIERS</b>, <span class="sc">2nd Duke
  of</span><a name="FnAnchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  (1628-1687), English statesman, son of the 1st duke, was born on the 30th
  of January 1628. He was brought up, together with his younger brother
  Francis, by King Charles I. with his own children, and was educated at
  Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained the degree of M.A. in 1642.
  He fought for the king in the Civil War, and took part in the attack on
  Lichfield Close in April 1643. Subsequently, under the care of the earl
  of Northumberland, the two brothers travelled abroad and lived at
  Florence and Rome. When the Second Civil War broke out they joined the
  earl of Holland in Surrey, in July 1648. Lord Francis was killed near
  Kingston, and Buckingham and Holland were surprised at St Neots on the
  10th, the duke succeeding in escaping to Holland. In consequence of his
  participation in the rebellion, his lands, which had been restored to him
  in 1647 on account of his youth, were now again confiscated, a
  considerable portion passing into the possession of Fairfax; and he
  refused to compound. Charles II. conferred on him the Garter on the 19th
  of September 1649, and admitted him to the privy council on the 6th of
  April 1650. In opposition to Hyde he supported the alliance with the
  Scottish presbyterians, accompanied Charles to Scotland in June, and
  allied himself with Argyll, dissuading Charles from joining the royalist
  plot of October 1650, and being suspected of betraying the plan to the
  convenanting leaders. In May he had been appointed general of the eastern
  association in England, and was commissioned to raise forces abroad; and
  in the following year he was chosen to lead the projected movement in
  Lancashire and to command the Scottish royalists. He was present with
  Charles at the battle of Worcester on the 3rd of September 1651, and
  escaped safely <!-- Page 725 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page725"></a>[v.04 p.0725]</span>alone to Rotterdam in October. His
  subsequent negotiations with Cromwell's government, and his readiness to
  sacrifice the interests of the church, separated him from the rest of
  Charles's advisers and diminished his influence; while his estrangement
  from the royal family was completed by his audacious courtship of the
  king's sister, the widowed princess of Orange, and by a money dispute
  with Charles. In 1657 he returned to England, and on the 15th of
  September married Mary, daughter of Lord Fairfax, who had fallen in love
  with him although the banns of her intended marriage with the earl of
  Chesterfield had been twice called in church. Buckingham was soon
  suspected of organizing a presbyterian plot against the government, and
  in spite of Fairfax's interest with Cromwell an order was issued for his
  arrest on the 9th of October. He was confined at York House about April
  1658, and having broken bounds was rearrested on the 18th of August and
  imprisoned in the Tower, where he remained till the 23rd of February
  1659, being then liberated on his promise not to abet the enemies of the
  government, and on Fairfax's security of £20,000. He joined the latter in
  his march against Lambert in January 1660, and afterwards claimed to have
  gained Fairfax to the cause of the Restoration.</p>

  <p>On the king's return Buckingham, who met him at his landing at Dover,
  was at first received coldly; but he was soon again in favour, was
  appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber, carried the orb at the
  coronation on the 23rd of April 1661, and was made lord-lieutenant of the
  West Riding of Yorkshire on the 21st of September. The same year he
  accompanied the princess Henrietta to Paris on her marriage with the duke
  of Orleans, but made love to her himself with such imprudence that he was
  recalled. On the 28th of April 1662 he was admitted to the privy council.
  His confiscated estates amounting to £26,000 a year were restored to him,
  and he was reputed the king's richest subject. He took part in the
  suppression of the projected insurrection in Yorkshire in 1663, went to
  sea in the first Dutch war in 1665, and was employed in taking measures
  to resist the Dutch or French invasion in June 1666.</p>

  <p>He was, however, debarred from high office by Clarendon's influence.
  Accordingly Buckingham's intrigues were now directed to effect the
  chancellor's ruin. He organized parties in both houses of parliament in
  support of the bill of 1666 prohibiting the import of Irish cattle,
  partly to oppose Clarendon and partly to thwart the duke of Ormonde.
  Having asserted during the debates that "whoever was against the bill had
  either an Irish interest or an Irish understanding," he was challenged by
  Lord Ossory. Buckingham avoided the encounter, and Ossory was sent to the
  Tower. A short time afterwards, during a conference between the two
  houses on the 19th of December, he came to blows with the marquess of
  Dorchester, pulling off the latter's periwig, while Dorchester at the
  close of the scuffle "had much of the duke's hair in his hand."<a
  name="FnAnchor_262" href="#Footnote_262"><sup>[2]</sup></a> According to
  Clarendon no misdemeanour so flagrant had ever before offended the
  dignity of the House of Lords. The offending peers were both sent to the
  Tower, but were released after apologizing; and Buckingham vented his
  spite by raising a claim to the title of Lord Roos held by Dorchester's
  son-in-law. His opposition to the government had forfeited the king's
  favour, and he was now accused of treasonable intrigues, and of having
  cast the king's horoscope. His arrest was ordered on the 25th of February
  1667, and he was dismissed from all his offices. He avoided capture till
  the 27th of June, when he gave himself up and was imprisoned in the
  Tower. He was released, however, by July 17th, was restored to favour and
  to his appointments on the 15 of September, and took an active part in
  the prosecution of Clarendon. On the latter's fall he became the chief
  minister, though holding no high office except that of master of the
  horse, bought from the duke of Albermarle in 1668. In 1671 he was elected
  chancellor of Cambridge, and in 1672 high steward of Oxford university.
  He favoured religious toleration, and earned the praise of Richard
  Baxter; he supported a scheme of comprehension in 1668, and advised the
  declaration of indulgence in 1672. He upheld the original jurisdiction of
  the Lords in Skinner's case. With these exceptions Buckingham's tenure of
  office was chiefly marked by scandals and intrigues. His illicit
  connexion with the countess of Shrewsbury led to a duel with her husband
  at Barn Elms on the 16th of January 1668, in which Shrewsbury was fatally
  wounded. The tale that the countess, disguised as a page, witnessed the
  encounter, appears to have no foundation; but Buckingham, by installing
  the "widow of his own creation" in his own and his wife's house, outraged
  even the lax opinion of that day. He was thought to have originated the
  project of obtaining the divorce of the childless queen. He intrigued
  against James, against Sir William Coventry&mdash;one of the ablest
  statesmen of the time, whose fall he procured by provoking him to send
  him a challenge&mdash;and against the great duke of Ormonde, who was
  dismissed in 1669. He was even suspected of having instigated Thomas
  Blood's attempt to kidnap and murder Ormonde, and was charged with the
  crime in the king's presence by Ormonde's son, Lord Ossory, who
  threatened to shoot him dead in the event of his father's meeting with a
  violent end. Arlington, next to Buckingham himself the most powerful
  member of the cabal and a favourite of the king, was a rival less easy to
  overcome; and he derived considerable influence from the control of
  foreign affairs entrusted to him. Buckingham had from the first been an
  adherent of the French alliance, while Arlington concluded through Sir
  William Temple in 1668 the Triple Alliance. But on the complete
  <i>volte-face</i> and surrender made by Charles to France in 1670,
  Arlington as a Roman Catholic was entrusted with the first treaty of
  Dover of the 20th of May&mdash;which besides providing for the united
  attack on Holland, included Charles's undertaking to proclaim himself a
  Romanist and to reintroduce the Roman Catholic faith into
  England,&mdash;While Buckingham was sent to France to carry on the sham
  negotiations which led to the public treaties of the 31st of December
  1670 and the 2nd of February 1672. He was much pleased with his reception
  by Louis XIV., declared that he had "more honours done him than ever were
  given to any subject," and was presented with a pension of 10,000 livres
  a year for Lady Shrewsbury. In June 1672 he accompanied Arlington to the
  Hague to impose terms on the prince of Orange, and with Arlington
  arranged the new treaty with Louis. After all this activity he suffered a
  keen disappointment in being passed over for the command of the English
  forces in favour of Schomberg. He now knew of the secret treaty of Dover,
  and towards the end of 1673 his jealousy of Arlington became open
  hostility. He threatened to impeach him, and endeavoured with the help of
  Louis to stir up a faction against him in parliament. This, however, was
  unsuccessful, and in January 1674 an attack was made upon Buckingham
  himself simultaneously in both houses. In the Lords the trustees of the
  young earl of Shrewsbury complained that Buckingham continued publicly
  his intimacy with the countess, and that a son of theirs had been buried
  in Westminster Abbey with the title of earl of Coventry; and Buckingham,
  after presenting an apology, was required, as was the countess, to give
  security for £10,000 not to cohabit together again. In the Commons he was
  attacked as the promoter of the French alliance, of "popery" and
  arbitrary government. He defended himself chiefly by endeavouring to
  throw the blame upon Arlington; but an address was voted petitioning the
  king to remove him from his councils, presence and from employment for
  ever. Charles, who had only been waiting for a favourable opportunity,
  and who was enraged at Buckingham's disclosures, consented with alacrity.
  Buckingham retired into private life, reformed his ways, attended church
  with his wife, began to pay his debts, became a "patriot," and was
  claimed by the country or opposition party as one of their leaders. In
  the spring of 1675 he was conspicuous for his opposition to the Test oath
  and for his abuse of the bishops, and on the 16th of November he
  introduced a bill for the relief of the nonconformists. On the 15th of
  February 1677 he was one of the four lords who endeavoured to embarrass
  the government by raising the question whether the parliament, not having
  assembled according to the act of Edward III. once in the year, had not
  been dissolved by <!-- Page 726 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page726"></a>[v.04 p.0726]</span>the recent prorogation. The motion
  was rejected and the four lords were ordered to apologize. On their
  refusing, they were sent to the Tower, Buckingham in particular
  exasperating the House by ridiculing its censure. He was released in
  July, and immediately entered into intrigues with Barillon, the French
  ambassador, with the object of hindering the grant of supplies to the
  king; and in 1678 he visited Paris to get the assistance of Louis XIV.
  for the cause of the opposition. He took an active part in the
  prosecution of those implicated in the supposed Popish Plot, and accused
  the lord chief justice (Sir William Scroggs) in his own court while on
  circuit of favouring the Roman Catholics. In consequence of his conduct a
  writ was issued for his apprehension, but it was never served. He
  promoted the return of Whig candidates to parliament, constituted himself
  the champion of the dissenters, and was admitted a freeman of the city of
  London. He, however, separated himself from the Whigs on the exclusion
  question, probably on account of his dislike of Monmouth and Shaftesbury,
  was absent from the great debate in the Lords on the 15th of November
  1680, and was restored to the king's favour in 1684.</p>

  <p>He took no part in public life after James's accession, but returned
  to his manor of Helmsley in Yorkshire, the cause of his withdrawal being
  probably exhausted health and exhausted finances. In 1685 he published a
  pamphlet, entitled <i>A short Discourse on the Reasonableness of Man's
  having a Religion</i> (reprinted in <i>Somers Tracts</i> (1813, ix. 13),
  in which after discussing the main subject he returned to his favourite
  topic, religious toleration. The tract provoked some rejoinders and was
  defended, amongst others, by William Penn, and by the author himself in
  <i>The Duke of Buckingham's Letter to the unknown author of a short
  answer to the Duke of Buckingham's Paper</i> (1685). In hopes of
  converting him to Roman Catholicism James sent him a priest, but
  Buckingham turned his arguments into ridicule. He died on the 16th of
  April 1687, from a chill caught while hunting, in the house of a tenant
  at Kirkby Moorside in Yorkshire, expressing great repentance and feeling
  himself "despised by my country and I fear forsaken by my God."<a
  name="FnAnchor_263" href="#Footnote_263"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The miserable
  picture of his end drawn by Pope, however, is greatly exaggerated. He was
  buried on the 7th of June 1687 in Henry VII.'s chapel in Westminster
  Abbey, in greater state, it was said, than the late king, and with
  greater splendour. With his death the family founded by the extraordinary
  rise to power and influence of the first duke ended. As he left no
  legitimate children the title became extinct, and his great estate had
  been completely dissipated; of the enormous mansion constructed by him at
  Cliveden in Buckinghamshire not a stone remains.</p>

  <p>The ostentatious licence and the unscrupulous conduct of the
  Alcibiades of the 17th century have been deservedly censured. But even
  his critics agree that he was good-humoured, good-natured, generous, an
  unsurpassed mimic and the leader of fashion; and with his good looks, in
  spite of his moral faults and even crimes, he was irresistible to his
  contemporaries. Many examples of his amusing wit have survived. His
  portrait has been drawn by Burnet, Count Hamilton in the <i>Mémoires de
  Grammont</i>, Dryden, Pope in the <i>Epistle to Lord Bathurst</i>, and
  Sir Walter Scott in <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>. He is described by
  Reresby as "the first gentleman of person and wit I think I ever saw,"
  and Burnet bears the same testimony. Dean Lockier, after alluding to his
  unrivalled skill in riding, dancing and fencing, adds, "When he came into
  the presence-chamber it was impossible for you not to follow him with
  your eye as he went along, he moved so gracefully." Racing and hunting
  were his favourite sports, and his name long survived in the hunting
  songs of Yorkshire. He was the patron of Cowley, Sprat, Matthew Clifford
  and Wycherley. He dabbled in chemistry, and for some years, according to
  Burnet, "he thought he was very near the finding of the philosopher's
  stone." He set up glass works at Lambeth the productions of which were
  praised by Evelyn; and he spent much money, according to his biographer
  Brian Fairfax, in building <i>insanae substructions</i>. Dryden described
  him under the character of Zimri in the celebrated lines in <i>Absalom
  and Achitophel</i> (to which Buckingham replied in <i>Poetical
  Reflections on a late Poem ... by a Person of Honour,
  1682</i>):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A man so various, that he seemed to be</p>
      <p>Not one, but all mankind's epitome;</p>
      <p>Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,</p>
      <p>Was everything by starts and nothing long;</p>
      <p>But in the course of one revolving moon,</p>
      <p>Was chymist, fiddler, statesman and buffoon....</p>
      <p>Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late,</p>
      <p>He had his jest, but they had his estate."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Buckingham, however, cannot with any truth be called the "epitome of
  mankind." On the contrary, the distinguishing features of his life are
  its incompleteness, aimlessness, imperfection, insignificance, neglect of
  talents and waste of opportunities. "He saw and approved the best," says
  Brian Fairfax, "but did too often <i>deteriora sequi</i>." He is more
  severely but more justly judged by himself. In gay moments indeed he had
  written&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>but his last recorded words on the approach of death, "O! what a
  prodigal have I been of that most valuable of all
  possessions&mdash;Time!" express with exact truth the fundamental flaw of
  his character and career, of which he had at last become conscious.</p>

  <p>Buckingham wrote occasional verses and satires showing undoubted but
  undeveloped poetical gifts, a collection of which, containing however
  many pieces not from his pen, was first published by Tom Brown in 1704;
  while a few extracts from a commonplace book of Buckingham of some
  interest are given in an article in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> of
  January 1898. He was the author of <i>The Rehearsal</i>, an amusing and
  clever satire on the heroic drama and especially on Dryden (first
  performed on the 7th of December 1671, at the Theatre Royal, and first
  published in 1672), a deservedly popular play which was imitated by
  Fielding in <i>Tom Thumb the Great</i>, and by Sheridan in the
  <i>Critic</i>. Buckingham also published two adapted plays, <i>The

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM, HENRY STAFFORD,</b> <span class="sc">2nd Duke
  of</span><a name="FnAnchor_271" href="#Footnote_271"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  (1454-1483), was the son of Humphrey Stafford, killed at the first battle
  of St Albans in 1455, and grandson of Humphrey the 1st duke (cr. 1444),
  killed at Northampton in 1460, both fighting for Lancaster. The 1st duke,
  who bore the title of earl of Buckingham in right of his mother, was the
  son of Edmund, 5th earl of Stafford, and of Anne, daughter of Thomas,
  duke <!-- Page 727 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page727"></a>[v.04
  p.0727]</span>of Gloucester, youngest son of Edward III.; Henry's mother
  was Margaret, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd duke of Somerset, grandson
  of John of Gaunt. Thus he came on both sides of the blood royal, and
  this, coupled with the vastness of his inheritance, made the young duke's
  future of importance to Edward IV. He was recognized as duke in 1465, and
  next year was married to Catherine Woodville, the queen's sister. On
  reaching manhood he was made a knight of the Garter in 1474, and in 1478
  was high steward at the trial of George, duke of Clarence. He had not
  otherwise filled any position of importance, but his fidelity might seem
  to have been secured by his marriage. However, after Edward's death,
  Buckingham was one of the first persons worked upon by Richard, duke of
  Gloucester. It was through his help that Richard obtained possession of
  the young king, and he was at once rewarded with the offices of justiciar
  and chamberlain of North and South Wales, and constable of all the royal
  castles in the principality and Welsh Marches. In the proceedings which
  led to the deposition of Edward V. he took a prominent part, and on the
  24th of June 1483 he urged the citizens at the Guildhall to take Richard
  as king, in a speech of much eloquence, "for he was neither unlearned and
  of nature marvellously well spoken." (More). At Richard's coronation he
  served as chamberlain, and immediately afterwards was made constable of
  England and confirmed in his powers in Wales. Richard might well have
  believed that the duke's support was secured. But early in August
  Buckingham withdrew from the court to Brecon. He may have thought that he
  deserved an even greater reward, or possibly had dreams of establishing
  his own claims to the crown. At all events, at Brecon he fell somewhat
  easily under the influence of his prisoner, John Morton (<i>q.v.</i>),
  who induced him to give his support to his cousin Henry Tudor, earl of
  Richmond. A widespread plot was soon formed, but Richard had early
  warning, and on the 15th of October, issued a proclamation against
  Buckingham. Buckingham, as arranged, prepared to enter England with a
  large force of Welshmen. His advance was stopped by an extraordinary
  flood on the Severn, his army melted away without striking a blow, and he
  himself took refuge with a follower, Ralph Bannister, at Lacon Hall, near
  Wem. The man betrayed him for a large reward, and on the 1st of November,
  Buckingham was brought to the king at Salisbury. Richard refused to see
  him, and after a summary trial had him executed next day (2nd of November
  1483), though it was a Sunday.</p>

  <p>Buckingham's eldest son, Edward (1478-1521), eventually succeeded him
  as 3rd duke, the attainder being removed in 1485; the second son, Henry,
  was afterwards earl of Wiltshire. The 3rd duke played an important part
  as lord high constable at the opening of the reign of Henry VIII., and is
  introduced into Shakespeare's play of that king, but he fell through his
  opposition to Wolsey, and in 1521 was condemned for treason and executed
  (17th of May); the title was then forfeited with his attainder, his only
  son Henry (1501-1563), who in his father's lifetime was styled earl of
  Stafford, being, however, given back his estates in 1522, and in 1547
  restored in blood by parliament with the title of Baron Stafford, which
  became extinct in this line with Roger, 5th Baron in 1640. In that year
  the barony of Stafford was granted to William Howard (1614-1680), who
  after two months was created Viscount Stafford; he was beheaded in 1680,
  and his son was created earl of Stafford in 1688, a title which became
  extinct in 1762; but in 1825 the descent to the barony of 1640 was
  established, to the satisfaction of the House of Lords, in the person of
  Sir G.W. Jerningham, in whose family it then continued.</p>

  <p>The chief original authorities for the life of the 2nd duke of
  Buckingham are the <i>Continuation of the Croyland Chronicle</i>; Sir
  Thomas More's <i>Richard III.</i>; and Fabyan's <i>Chronicle</i>. Amongst
  modern authorities consult J. Gairdner's <i>Richard III.</i>; and Sir. J.
  Ramsay's <i>Lancaster and York</i>.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM, JAMES SILK</b> (1786-1855), English author and
  traveller, was born near Falmouth on the 25th of August 1786, the son of
  a farmer. His youth was spent at sea. After years of wandering he
  established in 1818 the <i>Calcutta Journal</i>. This venture at first
  proved highly successful, but in 1823 the paper's outspoken criticisms of
  the East India Company led to the expulsion of Buckingham from India and
  to the suppression of the paper by John Adam, the acting
  governor-general. His case was brought before parliament, and a pension
  of £200 a year was subsequently awarded him by the East India Company as
  compensation. Buckingham continued his journalistic ventures on his
  return to England, and started the <i>Oriental Herald</i> (1824) and the
  <i>Athenaeum</i> (1828) which was not a success in his hands. In
  parliament, where he sat as member for Sheffield from 1832-1837, he was a
  strong advocate of social reform. He was a most voluminous writer. He had
  travelled much in Europe, America and the East, and wrote a great number
  of useful books of travel. In 1851 the value of these and of his other
  literary work was recognized by the grant of a civil list pension of £200
  a year. At the time of his death in London, on the 30th of June 1855,
  Buckingham was at work on his autobiography, two volumes of the intended
  four being completed and published (1855).</p>

  <p>His youngest son, Leicester Silk Buckingham (1825-1867), achieved no
  little popularity as a playwright, several of his free adaptations of
  French comedies being produced in London between 1860 and 1867.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM,</b> a market town and municipal borough and the county
  town of Buckinghamshire, England, in the Buckingham parliamentary
  division, 61 m. N.W. of London by a branch of the London &amp;
  North-Western railway. Pop. (1901) 3152. It lies in an open valley on the
  upper part of the river Ouse, which encircles the main portion of the
  town on three sides. The church of St Peter and St Paul, which was
  extensively restored by Sir Gilbert Scott, a native of this
  neighbourhood, is of the 18th century, and stands on the site of the old
  castle; the town hall dates from the close of the previous century; and
  the grammar school was founded by Edward VI., in part occupying buildings
  of earlier date, which retain Perpendicular and Decorated windows, and a
  Norman door. A chantry, founded in 1268 by Matthew Stratton, archdeacon
  of Buckingham, previously occupied the site; the Norman work may be a
  remnant of the chapel of a gild of the Holy Trinity. The manor house is
  of the early part of the 17th century, and other old houses remain. The
  adjacent mansion of Stowe, approached from the town by a magnificent
  avenue of elms, and surrounded by gardens very beautifully laid out, was
  the seat of the dukes of Buckingham until the extinction of the title in
  1889. Buckingham is served by a branch of the Grand Junction Canal, and
  has agricultural trade, manufactures of condensed milk and artificial
  manure, maltings and flour-mills; while an old industry survives to a
  modified extent in the manufacture of pillow-lace. The borough is under a
  mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 5006 acres.</p>

  <p>Buckingham (Bochingeham, Bukyngham) was an important stronghold in
  pre-Conquest times, and in 918 Edward the Elder encamped there with his
  army for four weeks, and threw up two forts on either side of the water.
  At the time of the Domesday survey there were twenty-six burgesses in
  Buckingham, which, together with the hamlet of Bourton, was assessed at
  one hide. Although it appears as a borough thus early, the town received
  no charter until 1554, when Queen Mary created it a free borough
  corporate with a bailiff, twelve principal burgesses and a steward, and
  defined the boundaries as extending in width from Dudley bridge to
  Thornborowe bridge and in length from Chackmore bridge to Padbury Mill
  bridge. A charter from Charles II. in 1684 was very shortly abandoned in
  favour of the original grant, which held force until the Municipal
  Corporations Act of 1835. In 1529 and from 1545 onwards Buckingham
  returned two members to parliament, until deprived by the Representation
  of the People Act of 1867 of one member, and by the Redistribution of
  Seats Act of 1885 of the other. Early mentions occur of markets and
  fairs, and from 1522, when Henry VIII. granted to Sir Henry Marney the
  borough of Buckingham with a Saturday market and two annual fairs, grants
  of fairs by various sovereigns were numerous. Buckingham was formerly an
  important agricultural centre, and Edward III. fixed here one of the
  staples for wool, but after the removal of these to Calais the trade
  suffered such decay that in an act of 32 Henry VIII. Buckingham is
  mentioned among thirty-six impoverished towns.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAM AND NORMANBY, JOHN SHEFFIELD,</b> <span class="sc">1st
  Duke of</span> (1648-1721), English statesman and poet, was born on <!--
  Page 728 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page728"></a>[v.04
  p.0728]</span>the 7th of April 1648. He was the son of Edmund, 2nd earl
  of Mulgrave, and succeeded to that title on his father's death in 1658.
  At the age of eighteen he joined the fleet, to serve in the first Dutch
  war; on the renewal of hostilities in 1672 he was present at the battle
  of Southwold Bay, and in the next year received the command of a ship. He
  was also made a colonel of infantry, and served for some time under
  Turenne. In 1680 he was put in charge of an expedition sent to relieve
  the town of Tangier. It was said that he was provided with a rotten ship
  in the hope that he would not return, but the reason of this abortive
  plot, if plot there was, is not exactly ascertained. At court he took the
  side of the duke of York, and helped to bring about Monmouth's disgrace.
  In 1682 he was dismissed from the court, apparently for putting himself
  forward as a suitor for the princess Anne, but on the accession of King
  James he received a seat in the privy council, and was made lord
  chamberlain. He supported James in his most unpopular measures, and
  stayed with him in London during the time of his flight. He also
  protected the Spanish ambassador from the dangerous anger of the mob. He
  acquiesced, however, in the Revolution, and in 1694 was made marquess of
  Normanby. In 1696 he refused in company with other Tory peers to sign an
  agreement to support William as their "rightful and lawful king" against
  Jacobite attempts, and was consequently dismissed from the privy council.
  On the accession of Anne, with whom he was a personal favourite, he
  became lord privy seal and lord-lieutenant of the North Riding of
  Yorkshire, and in 1703 duke of Buckingham and Normanby. During the
  predominance of the Whigs between 1705 and 1710, Buckingham was deprived
  of his office as lord privy seal, but in 1710 he was made lord steward,
  and in 1711 lord president of the council. After the death of Anne he
  held no state appointment. He died on the 24th of February 1721 at his
  house in St James's Park, which stood on the site of the present
  Buckingham Palace. Buckingham was succeeded by his son, Edmund
  (1716-1735) on whose death the titles became extinct.</p>

  <p>Buckingham, who is better known by his inherited titles as Lord
  Mulgrave, was the author of "An Account of the Revolution" and some other
  essays, and of numerous poems, among them the <i>Essay on Poetry</i> and
  the <i>Essay on Satire</i>. It is probable that the <i>Essay on
  Satire</i>, which attacked many notable persons, "sauntering Charles"
  amongst others, was circulated in MS. It was often attributed at the time
  to Dryden, who accordingly suffered a thrashing at the hands of
  Rochester's bravoes for the reflections it contained upon the earl.
  Mulgrave was a patron of Dryden, who may possibly have revised it, but
  was certainly not responsible, although it is commonly printed with his
  works. Mulgrave adapted Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar</i>, breaking it
  up into two plays, <i>Julius Caesar</i> and <i>Marcus Brutus</i>. He
  introduced choruses between the acts, two of these being written by Pope,
  and an incongruous love scene between Brutus and Portia. He was a
  constant friend and patron of Pope, who expressed a flattering opinion of
  his <i>Essay on Poetry</i>. This, although smoothly enough written, deals
  chiefly with commonplaces.</p>

  <p>In 1721 Edmund Curll published a pirated edition of his works, and was
  brought before the bar of the House of Lords for breach of privilege
  accordingly. An authorized edition under the superintendence of Pope
  appeared in 1723, but the authorities cut out the "Account of the
  Revolution" and "The Feast of the Gods" on account of their alleged
  Jacobite tendencies. These were printed at the Hague in 1727. Pope
  disingenuously repudiated any knowledge of the contents. Other editions
  reappeared in 1723, 1726, 1729, 1740 and 1753. His <i>Poems</i> were
  included in Johnson's and other editions of the British poets.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, EARLS OF.</b> The first earl of Buckinghamshire
  (to be distinguished from the earls of Buckingham, <i>q.v.</i>) was John
  Hobart (c. 1694-1756), a descendant of Sir Henry Hobart (d. 1625),
  attorney-general and chief justice of the common pleas under James I.,
  who was made a baronet in 1611, and who was the great-grandson of Sir
  James Hobart (d. 1507), attorney-general to Henry VII. The Hobarts had
  been settled in Norfolk and Suffolk for many years, when in 1728 John
  Hobart, who was a son of Sir Henry Hobart, the 4th baronet (d. 1698), was
  created Baron Hobart of Blickling. In 1740 Hobart became lord-lieutenant
  of Norfolk and in 1746 earl of Buckinghamshire, his sister, Henrietta
  Howard, countess of Suffolk, being the mistress of George II. He died on
  the 22nd of September 1756, and was succeeded as 2nd earl<a
  name="FnAnchor_281" href="#Footnote_281"><sup>[1]</sup></a> by his eldest
  son John (1723-1793), who was member of parliament for Norwich and
  comptroller of the royal household before his accession to the title.
  From 1762 to 1766 he was ambassador to Russia, and from 1776 to 1780
  lord-lieutenant of Ireland, but he was hardly equal to the exceptional
  difficulties with which he had to deal in the latter position. He died
  without sons at Blickling Hall, Norfolk, on the 3rd of August 1793, when
  his half-brother George (c. 1730-1804), became 3rd earl. Blickling Hall
  and his Norfolk estates, however, passed to his daughter, Henrietta
  (1762-1805), the wife of William Kerr, afterwards 6th marquess of
  Lothian.</p>

  <p>Robert Hobart, 4th earl of Buckinghamshire (1760-1816), the eldest son
  of the 3rd earl, was born on the 6th of May 1760. He was a soldier, and
  then a member of both the English and the Irish Houses of Commons; from
  1789 to 1793 he was chief secretary to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland,
  exerting his influence in this country to prevent any concessions to the
  Roman Catholics. In 1793, being known by the courtesy title of Lord
  Hobart, he was sent to Madras as governor, but in 1798, after serious
  differences between himself and the governor-general of India, Sir John
  Shore, afterwards Lord Teignmouth, he was recalled. Returning to British
  politics, Hobart was called up to the House of Lords in 1798 (succeeding
  to the earldom of Buckinghamshire in 1804); he favoured the union between
  England and Ireland; from March 1801 to May 1804 he was secretary for war
  and the colonies (his family name being taken for Hobart Town in
  Tasmania), and in 1805 he became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster
  under Pitt. For a short time he was joint postmaster-general, and from
  1812 until his death on the 4th of February 1816 he was president of the
  Board of Control, a post for which his Indian experience had fitted
  him.</p>

  <p>The 4th earl left no sons, and his titles passed to his nephew, George
  Robert Hobart (1789-1849), a son of George Vere Hobart (1761-1802),
  lieutenant-governor of Grenada. In 1824 the 5th earl inherited the
  Buckinghamshire estates of the Hampden family and took the name of
  Hampden, his ancestor, Sir John Hobart, 3rd baronet, having married Mary
  Hampden about 1655. On his death in February 1849 his brother, Augustus
  Edward Hobart (1793-1884), who took the name of Hobart-Hampden in 1878,
  became 6th earl. His two sons, Vere Henry, Lord Hobart (1818-1875),
  governor of Madras from 1872, and Frederick John Hobart (1821-1875),
  predeceased him, and when the 6th earl died he was succeeded by his
  grandson, Sidney Carr Hobart-Hampden (b. 1860), who became 7th earl of
  Buckinghamshire, and who added to his name that of Mercer-Henderson.
  Another of the 6th earl's sons was Augustus Charles Hobart-Hampden,
  generally known as Hobart Pasha (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

  with biography by Lady Hobart (1885).</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Footnote_281" href="#FnAnchor_281">[1]</a> Until 1784, when
  George Grenville, Earl Temple, was created marquess of Buckingham, the
  2nd earl of Buckinghamshire always signed himself "Buckingham"; his
  contemporaries knew him by this name, and hence a certain amount of
  confusion has arisen.</p>

</div>
  <p><b>BUCKINGHAMSHIRE</b> (abbreviated <i>Bucks</i>) a south midland
  county of England, bounded N. by Northamptonshire, E. by Bedfordshire,
  Hertfordshire and Middlesex, S. for a short distance by Surrey, and by
  Berkshire, and W. by Oxfordshire. Its area is 743.2 sq. m. The county is
  divided between the basins of the rivers Ouse and Thames. The first in
  its uppermost course forms part of the north-western boundary, passes the
  towns of Buckingham, Stony Stratford, Wolverton, Newport Pagnell and
  Olney, and before quitting the county forms a short stretch of the
  north-eastern boundary. The principal tributary it receives within the
  county is the Ouzel. The Thames forms the entire southern boundary; and
  of its tributaries Buckinghamshire includes the upper part of the Thames.
  To the north-west of Buckingham, and both east and west of the Ouzel, the
  land rises in gentle undulations to a height of nearly 500 ft., and north
  of the Thames valley a few nearly isolated hills stand boldly, such as
  Brill Hill and Muswell Hill, each over 600 ft., but the hilliest <!--
  Page 729 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page729"></a>[v.04
  p.0729]</span>part of the county is the south, which is occupied by part
  of the Chiltern system, the general direction of which is from south-west
  to north-east. The crest-line of these hills crosses the county at its
  narrowest point, along a line, above the towns of Prince's Risborough and
  Wendover, not exceeding 11 m. in length. This line divides the county
  into two parts of quite different physical character; for to the south
  almost the whole land is hilly (the longer slope of the Chiltern system
  lying in this direction), well wooded, and pleasantly diversified with
  narrow vales. The chief of these are watered by the Wye, Misbourne and
  Chess streams. The beech tree is predominant in the woods, in so much
  that William Camden, writing c. 1585, supposed the county to take name
  from this feature (A.S. <i>boc</i>, beech). In the south a remnant of
  ancient forest is preserved as public ground under the name of Burnham
  Beeches. The Chilterns reach a height of nearly 900 ft. within the
  county.</p>

  <p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The northern half of the county is occupied by
  Jurassic strata, in the southern half Cretaceous rocks predominate except
  in the south-eastern corner, where they are covered by Tertiary beds.
  Thus the oldest rocks are in the north, succeeded continuously by younger
  strata to the south; the general dip of all the rocks is south-easterly.
  A few patches of Upper Lias Clay appear near the northern boundary near
  Grafton Regis and Castle Thorpe, and again in the valley of the Ouse near
  Stoke Goldington and Weston Underwood. The Oolitic series is represented
  by the Great Oolite, with limestones in the upper part, much quarried for
  building stones at Westbury, Thornborough, Brock, Whittlewood Forest,
  &amp;c.; the lower portions are more argillaceous. The Forest Marble is
  seen about Thornton as a thin bed of clay with an oyster-bearing
  limestone at the base. Next above is the Cornbrash, a series of rubbly
  and occasionally hard limestones and thin clays. The outcrop runs by
  Tingwick, Buckingham, Berehampton and Newport Pagnell, it is quarried at
  Wolverton and elsewhere for road metal. Inliers of these rocks occur at
  Marsh Gibbon and Stan Hill. The Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay, with the
  Gault, lie in the vale of Aylesbury. The clay is covered by numerous
  outliers of Portland, Purbeck and Lower Greensand beds. The Portland beds
  are sandy below, calcareous above; the outcrop follows the normal
  direction in the county, from south-west to north-east, from Thame
  through Aylesbury; they are quarried at several places for building stone
  and fossils are abundant. The Hartwell Clay is in the Lower Portland.
  Freshwater Purbeck beds lie below the Portland and Lower Greensand beds;
  they cap the ridge between Oving and Whitchurch. Glass-making sands have
  been worked from the Lower Greensand at Hartwell, and phosphatic nodules
  from the same beds at Brickhill as well as from the Gault at Towersey. A
  broad band of Gault, a bluish clay, extends from Towersey across the
  county in a north-easterly direction. Resting upon the Gault is the Upper
  Greensand; at the junction of the two formations numerous springs arise,
  a circumstance which has no doubt determined the site of several
  villages. The Chalk rises abruptly from the low lying argillaceous plain
  to form the Chiltern Hills. The form of the whole of the hilly district
  round Chesham, High Wycombe and the Chalfonts is determined by the Chalk.
  Reading beds, mottled clays and sands, repose upon the Chalk at Woburn,
  Barnham, Fulmer and Denham, and these are in turn covered by the London
  Clay, which is exposed on the slopes about Stoke Common and Iver. Between
  the Tertiary-capped Chalk plateau and the Thames, a gentler slope,
  covered with alluvial gravel and brick earth, reaches down to the river.
  Thick deposits of plateau gravel cover most of the high ground in the
  southern corner of the county, while much of the northern part is
  obscured by glacial clays and gravels.</p>

  <p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The agricultural capacities of the soil vary
  greatly in different localities. On the lower lands, especially in the
  Vale of Aylesbury, about the headwaters of the Thame, it is extremely
  fertile; while on the hills it is usually poor and thin. The proportion
  of cultivated land is high, being about 83% of the whole. Of this a large
  and growing portion is in permanent pasture; cattle and sheep being
  reared in great numbers for the London markets, to which also are sent
  quantities of ducks, for which the district round Aylesbury is famous.
  Wheat and oats are the principal grain crops, though both decrease in
  importance. Turnips and swedes for the cattle are the chief green crops;
  and dairy-farming is largely practised. There is no general manufacturing
  industry, but a considerable amount of lace-making and straw-plaiting is
  carried on locally; and at High Wycombe and in its neighbourhood there is
  a thriving trade in various articles of turnery, such as chairs and
  bowls, from beech and other hard woods. The introduction of lace-making
  in this and neighbouring counties is attributed to Flemish, and later to
  French immigrants, but also to Catharine of Aragon during her residence
  (c. 1532) at Ampthill. Down to the later part of the 19th century a
  general holiday celebrated by lace-makers on the 25th of November was
  known as "Cattarn's Day."</p>

  <p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The main line of the London &amp;
  North-Western railway crosses the north-east part of the county.
  Bletchley is an important junction on this system, branches diverging
  east to Fenny Stratford, Bedford and Cambridge, and west to Oxford and
  Banbury, Buckingham being served by the western branch. There is also a
  branch from Cheddington to Aylesbury. The Metropolitan-Great Central
  joint line serves Amersham, Chesham (by a branch), and Aylesbury, joining
  the North-Western Oxford branch at Verney Junction; this line is used by
  the Great Central railway, the main line of which continues
  north-westward from Quainton Road. A light railway connects this station
  with the large village of Brill to the south-west. The Great Central and
  the Great Western companies jointly own a line passing through
  Beaconsfield, High Wycombe, and Prince's Risborough, which is connected
  northward with the Great Central system. Before the opening of this line
  in 1906 the Great Western branch from Maidenhead to Oxford was the only
  line serving High Wycombe and Prince's Risborough, from which there are
  branches to Watlington and Aylesbury. The main line of this company
  crosses the extreme south of the county by Slough and Taplow. The Grand
  Junction Canal, reaching the valley of the Ouse by way of the Ouzel
  valley from the south, has branches to Aylesbury and to Buckingham.
  Except the Thames none of the rivers in the county is continuously
  navigable.</p>

  <p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The area of the ancient
  county is 475,682 acres, with a population in 1891 of 185,284, and in
  1901 of 195,764. The area of the administrative county is 479,358 acres.
  The county contains eight hundreds, of which three, namely Stoke, Burnham
  and Desborough, form the "Chiltern Hundreds" (<i>q.v.</i>). The hundred
  of Aylesbury retains its ancient designation of the "three hundreds of
  Aylesbury." The municipal boroughs are Buckingham, the county town (pop.
  3152), and Wycombe, officially Chepping Wycombe, also Chipping or High
  Wycombe (15,542). The other urban districts are Aylesbury (9243),
  Beaconsfield (1570), Chesham (7245), Eton (3301), Fenny Stratford (4799),
  Linslade, on the Ouzel opposite to Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire
  (2157), Marlow (4526), Newport Pagnell (4028), Slough (11,453). Among the
  lesser market towns may be mentioned Amersham (2674), Ivinghoe (808),
  Olney (2684), Prince's Risborough (2189), Stony Stratford (2353),
  Wendover (2009) and Winslow (1703). At Wolverton (5323) are the carriage
  works of the London &amp; North-Western railway. Several of the villages
  on and near the banks of the Thames have become centres of residence,
  such as Taplow, Cookham and Bourne End, Burnham and Wooburn.
  Buckinghamshire is in the midland circuit, and assizes are held at
  Aylesbury. It has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into
  thirteen petty sessional divisions. The boroughs of Buckingham and
  Wycombe have separate commissions of the peace. The administrative county
  contains 230 civil parishes. Buckinghamshire is almost entirely within
  the diocese of Oxford, and 215 ecclesiastical parishes are situated
  wholly or in part within it. There are three parliamentary divisions,
  Northern or Buckingham, Mid or Aylesbury, and Southern or Wycombe, each
  returning one member; and the county contains a small part of the
  parliamentary borough of Windsor (chiefly in Berkshire). The most notable
  institution within the county is Eton College, the famous public school
  founded by Henry VI.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The district which was to become Buckinghamshire
  was reached by the West Saxons in 571, as by a series of victories they
  pushed their way north along the Thames valley. With the grouping of the
  settlements into kingdoms and the consolidation of Mercia under Offa,
  Buckinghamshire was included in Mercia until, with the submission of that
  kingdom to the Northmen, it became part of the Danelaw. In the 10th
  century Buckinghamshire suffered frequently from the ravages of the
  Danes, and numerous barrows and earthworks mark the scenes <!-- Page 730
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page730"></a>[v.04 p.0730]</span>of
  struggles against the invaders. These relics are especially abundant in
  the vale of Aylesbury, probably at this time one of the richest and best
  protected of the Saxon settlements. The Chiltern district, on the other
  hand, is said to have been an impassable forest infested by hordes of
  robbers and wild beasts. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Leofstan,
  12th abbot of St Albans, cut down large tracts of wood in this district
  and granted the manor of Hamstead (Herts) to a valiant knight and two
  fellow-soldiers on condition that they should check the depredations of
  the robbers. The same reason led at an early period to the appointment of
  a steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, and this office being continued long
  after the necessity for it had ceased to exist, gradually became the
  sinecure it is to-day. The district was not finally disforested until the
  reign of James I.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Norman invasion Buckinghamshire was probably
  included in the earldom of Leofwine, son of Godwin, and the support which
  it lent him at the battle of Hastings was punished by sweeping
  confiscations after the Conquest. The proximity of Buckinghamshire to
  London caused it to be involved in most of the great national events of
  the ensuing centuries. During the war between King John and his barons
  William Mauduit held Hanslape Castle against the king, until in 1216 it
  was captured and demolished by Falkes de Bréauté. The county was visited
  severely by the Black Death, and Winslow was one of many districts which
  were almost entirely depopulated. In the civil war Buckinghamshire was
  one of the first counties to join in an association for mutual defence on
  the side of the parliament, which had important garrisons at Aylesbury,
  Brill and elsewhere. Newport Pagnell was for a short time garrisoned by
  the royalist troops, and in 1644 the king fixed his headquarters at
  Buckingham.</p>

  <p>The shire of Buckingham originated with the division of Mercia in the
  reign of Edward the Elder, and was probably formed by the aggregation of
  pre-existing hundreds round the county town, a fact which explains the
  curious irregularities of the boundary line. The eighteen hundreds of the
  Domesday survey have now been reduced to eight, of which the three
  Chiltern hundreds, Desborough, Burnham and Stoke, are unaltered in extent
  as well as in name. The remainder have been formed each by the union of
  three of the ancient hundreds, and Aylesbury is still designated "the
  three hundreds of Aylesbury." All, except Newport and Buckingham, retain
  the names of Domesday hundreds, and the shire has altered little on its
  outer lines since the survey. Until the time of Queen Elizabeth
  Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire had a common sheriff. The shire court of
  the former county was held at Aylesbury.</p>

  <p>The ecclesiastical history of Buckinghamshire is not easy to trace, as
  there is no local chronicler, but the earliest churches were probably
  subject to the West Saxon see of Dorchester, and when after the Conquest
  the bishop's stool was transferred to Lincoln no change of jurisdiction
  ensued. After the dissolution of the monasteries it was proposed to form
  a new diocese to include Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, but the
  project was abandoned, and both remained in the Lincoln diocese until
  1837, when the latter was transferred to Oxford. The arch-deaconry was
  probably founded towards the close of the 11th century by Bishop Rémy,
  and the subdivision into rural deaneries followed shortly after. A dean
  of Thornborough is mentioned in the 12th century, and in the taxation of
  Nicholas IV. eight deaneries are given, comprising 186 parishes. In 1855
  the deaneries were reconstructed and made eighteen in number.</p>

  <p>On the redistribution of estates after the Conquest only two
  Englishmen continued to retain estates of any importance, and the chief
  landowners at this date were Walter Giffard, first earl of Buckingham,
  and Odo, bishop of Bayeux. Few of the great Buckinghamshire estates,
  however, remained with the same proprietors for any length of time. Many
  became annexed by religious establishments, while others reverted to the
  crown and were disposed of by various grants. The family of Hampden alone
  claim to have held the estate from which the name is derived in an
  unbroken line from Saxon times.</p>

  <p>Buckinghamshire has always ranked as an agricultural rather than a
  manufacturing county, and has long been famed for its corn and cattle.
  Fuller mentions the vale of Aylesbury as producing the biggest bodied
  sheep in England, and "Buckinghamshire bread and beef" is an old proverb.
  Lace-making, first introduced into this county by the Fleming refugees
  from the Alva persecution, became a very profitable industry. The
  monopolies of James I. considerably injured this trade, and in 1623 a
  petition was addressed to the high sheriff of Buckinghamshire
  representing the distress of the people owing to the decay of bone
  lace-making. Newport Pagnell and Olney were especially famous for their
  lace, and the parish of Hanslape is said to have made an annual profit of
  £8000 to £9000 from lace manufacture. The straw-plait industry was
  introduced in the reign of George I., and formerly gave employment to a
  large number of the population.</p>

  <p>The county was first represented in parliament by two members in 1290.
  The representation increased as the towns acquired representative rights,
  until in 1603 the county with its boroughs made a total return of
  fourteen members. By the Reform Act of 1832 this was reduced to eleven,
  and by the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885 the boroughs were deprived
  of representation and the county returned three members for three
  divisions.</p>

  <p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Buckinghamshire contains no ecclesiastical
  buildings of the first rank. Monastic remains are scanty, but two former
  abbeys may be noted. At Medmenham, on the Thames above Marlow, there are
  fragments, incorporated into a residence, of a Cistercian abbey founded
  in 1201; which became notorious in the middle of the 18th century as the
  meeting-place of a convivial club called the "Franciscans" after its
  founder, Sir Francis Dashwood, afterwards Lord le Despencer (1708-1781),
  and also known as the "Hell-Fire Club," of which John Wilkes, Bubb
  Dodington and other political notorieties were members. The motto of the
  club, <i>fay ce que voudras</i> (do what you will), inscribed on a
  doorway at the abbey, was borrowed from Rabelais' description of the
  abbey of Thelema in <i>Gargantua</i>. The remains of the Augustinian
  Notley Abbey (1162), incorporated with a farm-house, deserve mention
  rather for their picturesque situation by the river Thame than for their
  architectural value. Turning to churches, there is workmanship considered
  to be of pre-Norman date in Wing church, in the neighbourhood of Leighton
  Buzzard, including a polygonal apse and crypt. Stewkley church, in the
  same locality, shows the finest Norman work in the county; the building
  is almost wholly of the later part of this period, and the ornamentation
  is very rich. The Early English work of Chetwode and Haddenham churches,
  both in the west of the county, is noteworthy; especially in the first,
  which, as it stands, is the eastern part of a priory church of
  Augustinians (1244). Good specimens of the Decorated style are not
  wanting, though none is of special note; but the county contains three
  fine examples of Perpendicular architecture in Eton College chapel and
  the churches of Maids Moreton to the north, and Hillesden to the south,
  of Buckingham. Ancient domestic architecture is chiefly confined to a few
  country houses, of which Chequers Court, dating from the close of the
  16th century, is of interest not only from the architectural standpoint
  but from its beautiful situation high among the Chiltern Hills between
  Prince's Risborough and Wendover, and from a remarkable collection of
  relics of Oliver Cromwell, preserved here as a consequence of the
  marriage, in 1664, of John Russell, a grandson of the Protector, into the
  family to which the house then belonged. The manor-house of Hampden,
  among the hills east of Prince's Risborough, was for many generations the
  abode of the family of that name, and is still in the possession of
  descendants of John Hampden, who fell at the battle of Chalgrove in 1643,
  and is buried in Hampden church. Fine county seats are
  numerous&mdash;there may be mentioned Stowe (Buckingham), formerly the
  seat of the dukes of Buckingham; Cliveden and Hedsor, two among the many
  beautifully situated mansions by the bank of the Thames; and Claydon
  House in the west of the county. Among the Chiltern Hills, also, there
  are several <!-- Page 731 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page731"></a>[v.04 p.0731]</span>splendid domains. Associations
  with eminent men have given a high fame to several towns or villages of
  Buckinghamshire. Such are the connexion of Beaconsfield with Edmund
  Waller and Edmund Burke, that of Hughenden near Wycombe with Benjamin
  Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, whose father's residence was at Bradenham;
  of Olney and Stoke Pogis with the poets Cowper and Gray respectively. At
  Chalfont St Giles a cottage still stands in which Milton completed
  <i>Paradise Lost</i> and began <i>Paradise Regained</i>. In earlier life
  he had lived and worked at Horton, near the Thames below Windsor.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKLAND, FRANCIS TREVELYAN</b> (1826-1880), English zoologist, son
  of Dean William Buckland the geologist, was born at Oxford on the 17th of
  December 1826. He was educated at Winchester and Christ Church, taking
  his degree in 1848, and then adopted the medical profession, studying at
  St George's hospital, London, where he became house-surgeon in 1852. The
  pursuit of anatomy led him to a good deal of out-of-the-way research in
  zoology, and in 1856 he became a regular writer on natural history for
  the newly established <i>Field</i>, particularly on the subject of fish.
  In 1866 he started <i>Land and Water</i> on similar lines. In 1867 he was
  appointed government inspector of fisheries, and in the course of his
  work travelled constantly about the country, being largely responsible
  for the increased attention paid to the scientific side of pisciculture.
  Among his publications, besides articles and official reports, were
  <i>Fish Hatching</i> (1863), <i>Curiosities of Natural History</i> (4
  vols., 1857-1872), <i>Logbook of a Fisherman</i> (1875), <i>Natural
  History of British Fishes</i> (1881). He died on the 19th of December
  1880.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKLAND, WILLIAM</b> (1784-1856), English divine and geologist,
  eldest son of the Rev. Charles Buckland, rector of Templeton and Trusham,
  in Devon, was born at Axminster on the 12th of March 1784. He was
  educated at the grammar school of Tiverton, and at Winchester, and in
  1801 was elected a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, becoming
  B.A. in 1804. In 1809 he was elected a fellow of his college, and was
  admitted into holy orders. From early boyhood he had exhibited a strong
  taste for natural science, which was subsequently stimulated by the
  lectures of Dr John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry; and his attention
  was especially drawn to the then infant science of geology. He also
  attended the lectures of Sir Christopher Pegge (1765-1822) on anatomy. He
  now devoted himself systematically to an examination of the geological
  structure of Great Britain, making excursions, and investigating the
  order of superposition of the strata and the characters of the organic
  remains which they contained. In 1813, on the resignation of Dr Kidd, he
  was appointed reader in mineralogy in Oxford; and the interest excited by
  his lectures was so great that in 1819 a readership in geology was
  founded and especially endowed by the treasury, Dr Buckland being the
  first holder of the new appointment. In 1818 Dr Buckland was elected a
  fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1824 and again in 1840 he was chosen
  president of the Geological Society of London. In 1825 he was presented
  by his college to the living of Stoke Charity, near Whitchurch, Hants,
  and in the same year he was appointed by Lord Liverpool to a canonry of
  the cathedral of Christ Church, Oxford, when the degree of D.D. was
  conferred upon him. In 1825, also, he married Mary, the eldest daughter
  of Mr Benjamin Morland of Sheepstead House, near Abingdon, Berks, by
  whose abilities and excellent judgment he was materially assisted in his
  literary labours. In 1832 he presided over the second meeting of the
  British Association, which was then held at Oxford. In 1845 he was
  appointed by Sir Robert Peel to the vacant deanery of Westminster, and
  was soon after inducted to the living of Islip, near Oxford, a preferment
  attached to the deanery. In 1847 he was appointed a trustee in the
  British Museum; and in 1848 he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the
  Geological Society of London. In 1849 his health began to give way under
  the increasing pressure of his multifarious duties; and the later years
  of his life were overshadowed by a serious illness, which compelled him
  to live in retirement. He died on the 24th of August 1856, and was buried
  in a spot which he had himself chosen, in Islip churchyard.</p>

  <p>Buckland was a man many-sided in his abilities, and of a singularly
  wide range of attainments. Apart from his published works and memoirs in
  connexion with the special department of geology, and in addition to the
  work entailed upon him by the positions which he at different times held
  in the Church of England, he entered with great enthusiasm into many
  practical questions connected with agricultural and sanitary science, and
  various social and even medical problems. As a teacher he possessed
  powers of the highest order; and the university of Oxford is enriched by
  the large and valuable private collections, illustrative of geology and
  mineralogy, which he amassed in the course of his active life. It is,
  however, upon his published scientific works that Dr Buckland's great
  reputation is mainly based. His first great work was the well-known
  <i>Reliquiae Diluvianae, or Observations on the Organic Remains contained
  in caves, fissures, and diluvial gravel attesting the Action of a
  Universal Deluge</i>, published in 1823 (2nd ed. 1824), in which he
  supplemented his former observations on the remains of extinct animals
  discovered in the cavern of Kirkdale in Yorkshire, and expounded his
  views as to the bearing of these and similar cases on the Biblical
  account of the Deluge. Thirteen years after the publication of the
  <i>Reliquiae</i>, Dr Buckland w as called upon, in accordance with the
  will of the earl of Bridgewater, to write one of the series of works
  known as the <i>Bridgewater Treatises</i>. The design of these treatises
  was to exhibit the "power, wisdom, and goodness of God, as manifested in
  the Creation," and none of them was of greater value, as evinced by its
  vitality, than that on "Geology and Mineralogy." Originally published in
  1836, it has gone through three editions, and though not a "manual" of
  geological science, it still possesses high value as a storehouse of
  geological and palaeontological facts bearing upon the particular
  argument which it was designed to illustrate. The third edition, issued
  in 1858, was edited by his son Francis T. Buckland, and is accompanied by
  a memoir of the author and a list of his publications.</p>

  <p>Of Dr Buckland's numerous original contributions to the sciences of
  Geology and Palaeontology, the following may be mentioned:&mdash;(1) "On
  the Structure of the Alps and adjoining parts of the Continent, and their
  relation to the Secondary and Transition Rocks of England" (<i>Annals of
  Phil.</i>, 1821); (2) "Account of an Assemblage of Fossil Teeth and Bones
  of Elephant, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, &amp;c., discovered in a cave at
  Kirkdale in Yorkshire in the year 1821" (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>); (3) "On
  the Quartz Rock of the Lickey Hill in Worcestershire" (<i>Trans. Geol.
  Soc.</i>); (4) "On the Megalosaurus or Great Fossil Lizard of
  Stonesfield" (Ibid.); (5) "On the Cycadeoideae, a Family of Plants found
  in the Oolite Quarries of the Isle of Portland" (Ibid.); (6) "On the
  Discovery of a New Species of Pterodactyle in the Lias of Lyme Regis"
  (Ibid.); (7) "On the Discovery of Coprolites or Fossil Faeces in the Lias
  of Lyme Regis, and in other Formations" (Ibid.); (8) "On the Evidences of
  Glaciers in Scotland and the North of England" (<i>Proc. Geol. Soc.
  Lond.</i>); (9) "On the South-Western Coal District of England" (joint
  paper with the Rev. W.D. Conybeare, <i>Trans. Geol. Soc. Lond.</i>); (10)
  "On the Geology of the neighbourhood of Weymouth, and the adjacent parts
  of the Coast of Dorset" (joint paper with Sir H. De la Beche, <i>Trans.
  Geol. Soc. Lond.</i>).</p>

  <p>With regard to the Glacial theory propounded by Agassiz, no one
  welcomed it with greater ardour than Buckland, and he zealously sought to
  trace out evidences of former glaciation in Britain. A record of the
  interesting discussion which took place at the Geological Society's
  meeting in London in November 1840, <!-- Page 732 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page732"></a>[v.04 p.0732]</span>after the
  reading of a paper by Buckland, was printed in the <i>Midland
  Naturalist</i>, October 1883.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKLE, HENRY THOMAS</b> (1821-1862), English historian, author of
  the <i>History of Civilization</i>, the son of Thomas Henry Buckle, a
  wealthy London merchant, was born at Lee, in Kent, on the 24th of
  November 1821. Owing to his delicate health he was only a very short time
  at school, and never at college, but the love of reading having been
  early awakened in him, he was allowed ample means of gratifying it. He
  gained his first distinctions not in literature but in chess, being
  reputed, before he was twenty, one of the first players in the world.
  After his father's death in January 1840 he spent some time with his
  mother on the continent (1840-1844). He had by that time formed the
  resolution to direct all his reading and to devote all his energies to
  the preparation of some great historical work, and during the next
  seventeen years he bestowed ten hours each day in working out his
  purpose. At first he contemplated a history of the middle ages, but by
  1851 he had decided in favour of a history of civilization. The six years
  which followed were occupied in writing and rewriting, altering and
  revising the first volume, which appeared in June 1857. It at once made
  its author a literary and even social celebrity,&mdash;the lion of a
  London season. On the 1st of March 1858 he delivered at the Royal
  Institution a public lecture (the only one he ever gave) on the
  <i>Influence of Women on the Progress of Knowledge</i>, which was
  published in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for April 1858, and reprinted in
  the first volume of the <i>Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</i>. On the
  1st of April 1859 a crushing and desolating affliction fell upon him in
  the death of his mother. It was under the immediate impression of his
  loss that he concluded a review he was writing of J.S. Mill's <i>Essay on
  Liberty</i> with an argument for immortality, based on the yearning of
  the affections to regain communion with the beloved dead,&mdash;on the
  impossibility of standing up and living, if we believed the separation
  were final. The argument is a strange one to have been used by a man who
  had maintained so strongly that "we have the testimony of all history to
  prove the extreme fallibility of consciousness." The review appeared in
  <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, May 1859, and is to be found also in the
  <i>Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</i> (1872). The second volume of
  his history was published in May 1861. Soon after he left England for the
  East, in order to recruit his spirits and restore his health. From the
  end of October 1861 to the beginning of March 1862 was spent by him in
  Egypt, from which he went over the desert of Sinai and of Edom to Syria,
  reaching Jerusalem on the 19th of April 1862. After staying there eleven
  days, he set out for Europe by Beyrout, but at Nazareth he was attacked
  by fever; and he died at Damascus on the 29th of May 1862.</p>

  <p>Buckle's fame, which must rest wholly on his <i>History of
  Civilization in England</i>, is no longer what it was in the decade
  following his death. His <i>History</i> is a gigantic unfinished
  introduction, of which the plan was, first to state the general
  principles of the author's method and the general laws which govern the
  course of human progress; and secondly, to exemplify these principles and
  laws through the histories of certain nations characterized by prominent
  and peculiar features,&mdash;Spain and Scotland, the United States and
  Germany. Its chief ideas are&mdash;(1) That, owing partly to the want of
  ability in historians, and partly to the complexity of social phenomena,
  extremely little had as yet been done towards discovering the principles
  which govern the character and destiny of nations, or, in other words,
  towards establishing a science of history; (2) That, while the
  theological dogma of predestination is a barren hypothesis beyond the
  province of knowledge, and the metaphysical dogma of free will rests on
  an erroneous belief in the infallibility of consciousness, it is proved
  by science, and especially by statistics, that human actions are governed
  by laws as fixed and regular as those which rule in the physical world;
  (3) That climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary
  causes of intellectual progress,&mdash;the first three indirectly,
  through determining the accumulation and distribution of wealth, and the
  last by directly influencing the accumulation and distribution of
  thought, the imagination being stimulated and the understanding subdued
  when the phenomena of the external world are sublime and terrible, the
  understanding being emboldened and the imagination curbed when they are
  small and feeble; (4) That the great division between European and
  non-European civilization turns on the fact that in Europe man is
  stronger than nature, and that elsewhere nature is stronger than man, the
  consequence of which is that in Europe alone has man subdued nature to
  his service; (5) That the advance of European civilization is
  characterized by a continually diminishing influence of physical laws,
  and a continually increasing influence of mental laws; (6) That the
  mental laws which regulate the progress of society cannot be discovered
  by the metaphysical method, that is, by the introspective study of the
  individual mind, but only by such a comprehensive survey of facts as will
  enable us to eliminate disturbances, that is, by the method of averages;
  (7) That human progress has been due, not to moral agencies, which are
  stationary, and which balance one another in such a manner that their
  influence is unfelt over any long period, but to intellectual activity,
  which has been constantly varying and advancing:&mdash;"The actions of
  individuals are greatly affected by their moral feelings and passions;
  but these being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other
  individuals, are balanced by them, so that their effect is, in the great
  average of human affairs, nowhere to be seen, and the total actions of
  mankind, considered as a whole, are left to be regulated by the total
  knowledge of which mankind is possessed"; (8) That individual efforts are
  insignificant in the great mass of human affairs, and that great men,
  although they exist, and must "at present" be looked upon as disturbing
  forces, are merely the creatures of the age to which they belong; (9)
  That religion, literature and government are, at the best, the products
  and not the causes of civilization; (10) That the progress of
  civilization varies directly as "scepticism," the disposition to doubt
  and to investigate, and inversely as "credulity" or "the protective
  spirit," a disposition to maintain, without examination, established
  beliefs and practices.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately Buckle either could not define, or cared not to define,
  the general conceptions with which he worked, such as those denoted by
  the terms "civilization," "history," "science," "law," "scepticism," and
  "protective spirit"; the consequence is that his arguments are often
  fallacies. Moreover, the looseness of his statements and the rashness of
  his inferences regarding statistical averages make him, as a great
  authority has remarked, the <i>enfant terrible</i> of moral
  statisticians. He brought a vast amount of information from the most
  varied and distant sources to confirm his opinions, and the abundance of
  his materials never perplexed or burdened him in his argumentation, but
  examples of well-conducted historical argument are rare in his pages. He
  sometimes altered and contorted the facts; he very often unduly
  simplified his problems; he was very apt when he had proved a favourite
  opinion true to infer it to be the whole truth. On the other hand, many
  of his ideas have passed into the common literary stock, and have been
  more precisely elaborated by later writers on sociology and history; and
  though his own work is now somewhat neglected, its influence was
  immensely valuable in provoking further research and speculation.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKNER, SIMON BOLIVAR</b> (1823- ), American soldier and political
  leader, was born in Hart county, Kentucky, on the 1st of April 1823. He
  graduated at West Point in 1844, and was assistant professor of
  geography, history and ethics there in 1845-1846. He fought in several
  battles of the Mexican War, received the brevet of first lieutenant for
  gallantry at Churubusco, where he was wounded, and later, after the
  storming of Chapultepec, received the brevet of captain. In 1848-1850 he
  was assistant instructor of infantry tactics at West Point. During the
  succeeding five years he was in the recruiting service, on frontier duty,
  and finally in the subsistence department. He resigned from the army in
  March 1855. During the futile attempt of Governor Beriah Magoffin to
  maintain Kentucky in a position of neutrality, he was commander of the
  state <!-- Page 733 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page733"></a>[v.04
  p.0733]</span>guard; but in September 1861, after the entry of Union
  forces into the state, he openly espoused the Confederate cause and was
  commissioned brigadier-general, later becoming lieutenant-general. He was
  third in command of Fort Donelson at the time of General Grant's attack
  (February 1862), and it fell to him, after the escape of Generals Floyd
  and Pillow, to surrender the post with its large garrison and valuable
  supplies. General Buckner was exchanged in August of the same year, and
  subsequently served under General Bragg in the invasion of Kentucky and
  the campaign of Chickamauga. He was governor of Kentucky in 1887-1891,
  was a member of the Kentucky constitutional convention of 1890, and in
  1896 was the candidate of the National or "Gold" Democrats for
  vice-president of the United States.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKRAM</b> (a word common, in various early forms, to many
  European languages, as in the Fr. <i>bouqueran</i> or Ital.
  <i>bucherame</i>, the derivation of which is unknown), in early usage the
  name of a fine linen or cotton cloth, but now only of a coarse fabric of
  linen or cotton stiffened with glue or other substances, used for linings
  of clothes and in bookbinding. Falstaff's "men in buckram" (Shakespeare,
  <i>Henry IV.</i>, pt. i. II. 4) has become a proverbial phrase for any
  imaginary persons.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKSTONE, JOHN BALDWIN</b> (1802-1879), English actor and dramatic
  writer, was born at Hoxton on the 14th of September 1802. He was articled
  to a solicitor, but soon exchanged the law for the stage. After some
  years as a provincial actor he made his first London appearance, on the
  30th of January 1823, at the Surrey theatre, as Ramsay in the <i>Fortunes
  of Nigel</i>. His success led to his engagement in 1827 at the Adelphi,
  where he remained as leading low comedian until 1833. At the Haymarket,
  which he joined for summer seasons in 1833, and of which he was lessee
  from 1853 to 1878, he appeared as Bobby Trot in his own <i>Luke the
  Labourer</i>; and here were produced a number of his plays and farces,
  <i>Ellen Wareham, Uncle Tom</i> and others. After his return from a visit
  to the United States in 1840 he played at several London theatres, among
  them the Lyceum, where he was Box at the first representation of <i>Box
  and Cox</i>. As manager of the Haymarket he surrounded himself with an
  admirable company, including Sothern and the Kendals. He produced the
  plays of Gilbert, Planché, Tom Taylor and Robertson, as well as his own,
  and in most of these he acted. He died on the 31st of October 1879. He
  was the author of 150 plays, some of which have been very popular. His
  daughter, Lucy Isabella Buckstone (1858-1893), was an actress, who made
  her first London appearance at the Haymarket theatre as Ada Ingot in
  <i>David Garrick</i> in 1875.</p>

  <p><b>BUCKTHORN,</b> known botanically as <i>Rhamnus cathartica</i>
  (natural order Rhamnaceae), a much-branched shrub reaching 10 ft. in
  height, with a blackish bark, spinous branchlets, and ovate,
  sharply-serrated leaves, 1 to 2 in. long, arranged several together at
  the ends of the shoots. The small green flowers are regular and have the
  parts in fours; male and female flowers are borne on different plants.
  The fruit is succulent, black and globose, and contains four stones. The
  plant is a native of England, occurring in woods and thickets chiefly on
  the chalk; it is rare in Ireland and not wild in Scotland. It is native
  in Europe, north Africa and north Asia, and naturalized in some parts of
  eastern North America. The fruit has strong purgative properties, and the
  bark yields a yellow dye.</p>

  <p>An allied species, <i>Rhamnus Frangula</i>, is also common in England,
  and is known as berry-bearing or black alder. It is distinguished from
  buckthorn by the absence of spiny branchlets, its non-serrated leaves,
  and bisexual flowers with parts in fives. The fruits are purgative and
  yield a green dye when unripe. The soft porous wood, called black
  dogwood, is used for gunpowder. Dyes are obtained from fruits and bark of
  other species of <i>Rhamnus</i>, such as <i>R. infectoria</i>, <i>R.
  tinctoria</i> and <i>R. davurica</i>&mdash;the two latter yielding the
  China green of commerce. Several varieties of <i>R. Alaternus</i>, a
  Mediterranean species, are grown in shrubberies.</p>

  <p>Sea-buckthorn is <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i>, a willow-like shrub, 1
  to 8 ft. in height, with narrow leaves silvery on the underside, and
  globose orange-yellow fruits one-third of an inch in diameter. It occurs
  on sandy seashores from York to Kent and Sussex, but is not common.</p>

  <p>American buckthorns are: <i>Rhamnus purshiana</i> or <i>Cascara
  sagrada</i>, of the Pacific coast, producing cascara bark, and <i>R.
  Caroliniana</i>, the alder-buckthorn. <i>Bumelia lycioides</i> (or
  <i>lanuginosa</i>) is popularly called "southern buckthorn."</p>

  <p><b>BUCKWHEAT,</b> the fruit (so-called seeds) of <i>Fagopyrum
  esculentum</i> (natural order Polygonaceae), a herbaceous plant, native
  of central Asia, but cultivated in Europe and North America; also
  extensively cultivated in the Himalaya, as well as an allied species
  <i>F. tataricum</i>. The fruit has a dark brown tough rind enclosing the
  kernel or seed, and is three-sided in form, with sharp angles, similar in
  shape to beech-mast, whence the name from the Ger. <i>Buchweizen</i>,
  beechwheat. Buckwheat is grown in Great Britain only to supply food for
  pheasants and to feed poultry, which devour the seeds with avidity. In
  the northern countries of Europe, however, the seeds are employed as
  human food, chiefly in the form of cakes, which when baked thin have an
  agreeable taste, with a darkish somewhat violet colour. The meal of
  buckwheat is also baked into crumpets, as a favourite dainty among Dutch
  children, and in the Russian army buckwheat groats are served out as part
  of the soldiers' rations, which they cook with butter, tallow or
  hemp-seed oil. Buckwheat is also used as food in the United States, where
  "buckwheat cakes" are a national dish; and by the Hindus it is eaten on
  "bart" or fast days, being one of the phalahas, or lawful foods for such
  occasions. When it is used as food for cattle the hard sharp angular rind
  must first be removed. As compared with the principal cereal grains,
  buckwheat is poor in nitrogenous substances and fat; but the rapidity and
  ease with which it can be grown render it a fit crop for very poor, badly
  tilled land. An immense quantity of buckwheat honey is collected in
  Russia, bees showing a marked preference for the flowers of the plant.
  The plant is also used as a green fodder.</p>

  <p>In the United States buckwheat is sown at the end of June or beginning
  of July, the amount of seed varying from 3 to 5 pecks to the acre. The
  crop matures rapidly and continues blooming till frosts set in, so that
  at harvest, which is usually set to occur just before this period, the
  grain is in various stages of ripeness. It is cut by hand or with the
  self-delivery reaper, and allowed to lie in the swath for a few days and
  then set up in shocks. The stalks are not tied into bundles as in the
  case of other grain crops, the tops of the shocks being bound round and
  held together by twisting stems round them. The threshing is done on the
  field in most cases.</p>

  <p><b>BUCOLICS</b> (from the Gr. <span title="boukolikos" class="grk"
  >&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>,
  "pertaining to a herdsman"), a term occasionally used for rural or
  pastoral poetry. The expression has been traced back in English to the
  beginning of the 14th century, being used to describe the "Eclogues" of
  Virgil. The most celebrated collection of bucolics in antiquity is that
  of Theocritus, of which about thirty, in the Doric dialect, and mainly
  written in hexameter verse, have been preserved. This was the name, as is
  believed, originally given by Virgil to his pastoral poems, with the
  direct object of challenging comparison with the writings of Theocritus.
  In modern times the term "bucolics" has not often been specifically given
  by the poets to their pastorals; the main exception being that of
  Ronsard, who collected his eclogues under the title of "Les Bucoliques."
  In general practice the word is almost a synonym for pastoral poetry, but
  has come to bear a slightly more agricultural than shepherd
  signification, so that the "Georgics" of Virgil has grown to seem almost
  more "bucolic" than his "Eclogues." (See also <span
  class="sc">Pastoral</span>.)</p>

  <p><b>BUCYRUS,</b> a city and the county-seat of Crawford county, Ohio,
  U.S.A., on the Sandusky river, 62 m. N. of Columbus. Pop. (1890) 5974;
  (1900) 6560 (756 foreign-born); (1910) 8122. It is served by the
  Pennsylvania, the Toledo, Walhonding Valley &amp; Ohio (Pennsylvania
  system), and the Ohio Central railways, and by interurban electric lines.
  The Ohio Central, of which Bucyrus is a division terminal, has shops
  here. The city lies at an elevation of about 1000 ft. above sea-level,
  and is surrounded <!-- Page 734 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page734"></a>[v.04 p.0734]</span>by a country well adapted to
  agriculture and stock-raising. Among its manufactures are machinery,
  structural steel, ventilating and heating apparatus, furniture, interior
  woodwork, ploughs, wagons, carriages, copper products and clay-working
  machines. Bucyrus was first settled in 1817; it was laid out as a town in
  1822, was incorporated as a village in 1830, and became a city in 1885.
  The county-seat was permanently established here in 1830.</p>

  <p><b>BUDAPEST,</b> the capital and largest town of the kingdom of
  Hungary, and the second town of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, 163 m.
  S.E. of Vienna by rail. Budapest is situated on both banks of the Danube,
  and is formed of the former towns of Buda (Ger. <i>Ofen</i>) together
  with O-Buda (Ger. <i>Alt-Ofen</i>) on the right bank, and of Pest
  together with Köbánya (Ger. <i>Steinbruch</i>) on the left bank, which
  were all incorporated into one municipality in 1872. It lies at a point
  where the Danube has definitely taken its southward course, and just
  where the outlying spurs of the outer ramifications of the Alps, namely,
  the Bakony Mountains, meet the Carpathians. Budapest is situated nearly
  in the centre of Hungary, and dominates by its strategical position the
  approach from the west to the great Hungarian plain. The imposing size of
  the Danube, 300 to 650 yds. broad, and the sharp contrast of the two
  banks, place Budapest among the most finely situated of the larger towns
  of Europe. On the one side is a flat sandy plain, in which lies Pest,
  modern of aspect regularly laid out, and presenting a long frontage of
  handsome buildings to the river. On the other the ancient town of Buda
  straggles capriciously over a series of small and steep hills, commanded
  by the fortress and the Blocksberg (770 ft. high, 390 ft. above the
  Danube), and backed beyond by spurs of mountains, which rise in the form
  of terraces one above the other. The hills are generally devoid of
  forests, while those near the towns were formerly covered with vineyards,
  which produced a good red wine. The vineyards have been almost completely
  destroyed by the phylloxera.</p>

  <p>Budapest covers an area of 78 sq. m., and is divided into ten
  municipal districts, namely Vár (Festung), Viziváros (Wasserstadt),
  Ó-Buda (Alt-Ofen), all on the right bank, belonging to Buda, and Belváros
  (Inner City), Lipótváros (Leopoldstadt), Terézváros (Theresienstadt),
  Erzsébetváros (Elisabethstadt), Józsefváros (Josephstadt), Ferenczváros
  (Franzstadt), and Köbánya (Steinbruch), all on the left bank, belonging
  to Pest. Buda, with its royal palace, the various ministries, and other
  government offices, is the official centre, while Pest is the commercial
  and industrial part, as well as the centre of the nationalistic and
  intellectual life of the town. The two banks of the Danube are united by
  six bridges, including two fine suspension bridges; the first of them,
  generally known as the Ketten-Brücke, constructed by the brothers Tiernay
  and Adam Clark in 1842-1849, is one of the largest in Europe. It is 410
  yds. long, 39 ft. broad, 36 ft. high above the mean level of the water,
  and its chains rest on two pillars 160 ft. high; its ends are ornamented
  with four colossal stone lions. At one end is a tunnel, 383 yds. long,
  constructed by Adam Clark in 1854, which pierces the castle hill and
  connects the quarter known as the Christinenstadt with the Danube. The
  other suspension bridge is the Schwurplatz bridge, completed in 1903, 56
  ft. broad, with a span of 317 yds. The other bridges are the Margaret
  bridge, with a junction bridge towards the Margaret island, the Franz
  Joseph bridge, and two railway bridges.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most attractive part of Budapest is the line of broad
  quays on the left bank of the Danube, which extend for a distance of 2½
  m. from the Margaret bridge to the custom-house, and are lined with
  imposing buildings. The most important of these is the Franz Joseph Quai,
  1 m. long, which contains the most fashionable cafés and hotels, and is
  the favourite promenade. The inner town is surrounded by the Innere
  Ring-Strasse, a circle of wide boulevards on the site of the old wall.
  Wide tree-shaded streets, like the Király Utcza, the Kerrepesi Ut, and
  the Üllöi Ut, also form the lines of demarcation between the different
  districts. The inner ring is connected by the Váczi Körut (Waitzner-Ring)
  with the Grosse Ring-Strasse, a succession of boulevards, describing a
  semicircle beginning at the Margaret bridge and ending at the Boráros
  Platz, near the custom-house quay, through about the middle of the town.
  One of the most beautiful streets in the town is the Andrássy Ut, 1½ m.
  long, connecting Váczi Körut with Városliget (<i>Stadtwäldchen</i>), the
  favourite public park of Budapest. It is a busy thoroughfare, lined in
  its first half with magnificent new buildings, and in its second half,
  where it attains a width of 150 ft., with handsome villas standing in
  their own gardens, which give the impression rather of a fashionable
  summer resort than the centre of a great city. Budapest possesses
  numerous squares, generally ornamented with monuments of prominent
  Hungarians, usually the work of Hungarian artists.</p>

  <p><i>Buildings.</i>&mdash;Though of ancient origin, neither Buda nor
  Pest has much to show in the way of venerable buildings. The oldest
  church is the Matthias church in Buda, begun by King Bela IV. in the 13th
  century, completed in the 15th century, and restored in 1890-1896. It was
  used as a mosque during the Turkish occupation, and here took place the
  coronation of Franz Joseph as king of Hungary in 1867. The garrison
  church, a Gothic building of the 13th century, and the Reformed church,
  finished in 1898, are the other ecclesiastical buildings in Buda worth
  mentioning. The oldest church in Pest is the parish church situated in
  the Eskü-Ter (Schwur-Platz) in the inner town; it was built in 1500, in
  the Gothic style, and restored in 1890. The most magnificent church in
  Pest is the Leopoldstadt Basilica, a Romanesque building with a dome 315
  ft. in height, begun in 1851; next comes the Franzstadt church, also a
  Romanesque building, erected in 1874. Besides several modern churches,
  Budapest possesses a beautiful synagogue, in the Moorish style, erected
  in 1861, and another, in the Moorish-Byzantine style, built in 1872,
  while in 1901 the construction of a much larger synagogue was begun. In
  Buda, near the Kaiserbad, and not far from the Margaret bridge, is a
  small octagonal Turkish mosque, with a dome 25 ft. high, beneath which is
  the grave of a Turkish monk. By a special article in the treaty of
  Karlowitz of 1699 the emperor of Austria undertook to preserve this
  monument.</p>

  <p>Among the secular buildings the first place is taken by the royal
  palace in Buda, which, together with the old fortress, crowns the summit
  of a hill, and forms the nucleus of the town. The palace erected by Maria
  Theresa in 1748-1771 was partly burned in 1849, but has been restored and
  largely extended since 1894. In the court chapel are preserved the
  regalia of Hungary, namely, the crown of St Stephen, the sceptre, orb,
  sword and the coronation robes. It is surrounded by a magnificent garden,
  which descends in steep terraces to the Danube, and which offers a
  splendid view of the town lying on the opposite bank. New and palatial
  buildings of the various ministries, several high and middle schools, a
  few big hospitals, and the residences of several Hungarian magnates, are
  among the principal edifices in this part of the town.</p>

  <p>The long range of substantial buildings fronting the left bank of the
  Danube includes the Houses of Parliament (see <span
  class="sc">Architecture</span>, Plate IX. fig. 115), a huge limestone
  edifice in the late Gothic style, covering an area of 3¾ acres, erected
  in 1883-1902; the Academy, in Renaissance style, erected in 1862-1864,
  containing a lofty reception room, a library, a historic picture gallery,
  and a botanic collection; the Redoute buildings, a large structure in a
  mixed Romanesque and Moorish style, erected for balls and other social
  purposes; the extensive custom-house at the lower end of the quays, and
  several fine hotels and insurance offices. In the beautiful Andrássy Ut
  are the opera-house (1875-1884), in the Italian Renaissance style; the
  academy of music; the old and new exhibition building; the national
  drawing school; and the museum of fine arts (1900-1905), in which was
  installed in 1905 the national gallery, formed by Prince Esterházy,
  bought by the government in 1865 for £130,000, and formerly housed in the
  academy, and the collection of modern pictures from the national museum.
  At the end of the street is one of the numerous monuments erected in
  various parts of the country to commemorate the thousandth anniversary of
  the foundation of the kingdom of Hungary. Other buildings remarkable for
  their <!-- Page 735 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page735"></a>[v.04
  p.0735]</span>size and interest are: the national museum (1836-1844); the
  town-hall (1869-1875), in the early Renaissance style; the university,
  with a baroque façade (rebuilt 1900), and the university library (opened
  in 1875), a handsome Renaissance building; the palace of justice (1896),
  a magnificent edifice situated not far from the Houses of Parliament. In
  its neighbourhood also are the palatial buildings of the ministries of
  justice and of agriculture. There are also the exchange (1905); the
  Austro-Hungarian bank (1904); the central post and telegraph office; the
  art-industrial museum (1893-1897), in oriental style, with some
  characteristically Hungarian ornamentations; several handsome theatres;
  large barracks; technical and secondary schools; two great railway
  termini and a central market (1897) to be mentioned. To the south-east of
  the town lies the vast slaughter-house (1870-1872), which, with the
  adjacent cattle-market, covers nearly 30 acres of ground. The building
  activity of Budapest since 1867 has been extraordinary, and the town has
  undergone a thorough transformation. The removal of slums and the
  regulation of the older parts of the town, in connexion with the
  construction of the two new bridges across the Danube and of the railway
  termini, went hand-in-hand with the extension of the town, new quarters
  springing up on both banks of the Danube. This process is still going on,
  and Budapest has become one of the handsomest capitals of Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;Budapest is the intellectual capital of
  Hungary. At the head of its educational institutions stands the
  university, which was attended in 1900 by 4983 students&mdash;only about
  2000 in 1880&mdash;and has a staff of nearly 200 professors and
  lecturers. It has been completely transformed into a national Hungarian
  seat of learning since 1867, and great efforts have been made to keep at
  home the Hungarian students, who before then frequented other
  universities and specially that of Vienna. It is well provided with
  scientific laboratories, botanic garden, and various collections, and
  possesses a library with nearly a quarter of a million volumes. The
  university of Budapest, the only one in Hungary proper, was established
  at Tyrnau in 1635, removed to Buda in 1777, and transferred to Pest in
  1783. Next to it comes the polytechnic, attended by 1816 students in
  1900, which is also thoroughly equipped for a scientific training. Other
  high schools are a veterinary academy, a Roman Catholic seminary, a
  Protestant theological college, a rabbinical institute, a commercial
  academy, to which has been added in 1899 an academy for the study of
  oriental languages, and military academies for the training of Hungarian
  officers. Budapest possesses an adequate number of elementary and
  secondary schools, as well as a great number of special and technical
  schools. At the head of the scientific societies stands the academy of
  sciences, founded in 1825, for the encouragement of the study of the
  Hungarian language and the various sciences except theology. Next to it
  comes the national museum, founded in 1807 through the donations of Count
  Stephan Széchényi, which contains extensive collections of antiquities,
  natural history and ethnology, and a rich library which, in its
  manuscript department of over 20,000 MSS., contains the oldest specimens
  of the Hungarian language. Another society which has done great service
  for the cultivation of the Hungarian language is the Kisfaludy society,
  founded in 1836. It began by distributing prizes for the best literary
  productions of the year, then it started the collection and publication
  of the Hungarian folklore, and lastly undertook the translation into the
  Hungarian language of the masterpieces of foreign literatures. The
  influence exercised by this society is very great, and it has attracted
  within its circle the best writers of Hungary. Another society similar in
  aim with this one is the Petöfi society, founded in 1875. Amongst the
  numerous scientific associations are the central statistical department,
  and the Budapest communal bureau of statistics, which under the
  directorship of Dr Joseph de Körösy has gained a European reputation.</p>

  <p>The artistic life in Budapest is fostered by the academy of music,
  which once had Franz Liszt as its director, a <i>conservatoire</i> of
  music, a dramatic school, and a school for painting and for drawing, all
  maintained by the government. Budapest possesses, besides an opera house,
  eight theatres, of which two are subsidized by the government and one by
  the municipality. The performances are almost exclusively in Hungarian,
  the exceptions being the occasional appearance of French, Italian and
  other foreign artists. Performances in German are under a popular taboo,
  and they are never given in a theatre at Budapest.</p>

  <p><i>Trade.</i>&mdash;-In commerce and industry Budapest is by far the
  most important town in Hungary, and in the former, if not also in the
  latter, it is second to Vienna alone in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
  The principal industries are steam flour-milling, distilling, and the
  manufacture of machinery, railway plant, carriages, cutlery, gold and
  silver wares, chemicals, bricks, jute, and the usual articles produced in
  large towns for home consumption. The trade of Budapest is mainly in
  corn, flour, cattle, horses, pigs, wines, spirits, wool, wood, hides, and
  in the articles manufactured in the town. The efforts of the Hungarian
  government to establish a great home industry, and the measures taken to
  that effect, have benefited Budapest to a greater degree than any other
  Hungarian town, and the progress made is remarkable. The increase in the
  number of joint-stock companies, and the capital thus invested in
  industrial undertakings, furnish a valuable indication. In 1873 there
  were 28 such companies with a total capital of £2,224,900; in 1890, 75
  with a capital of £9,352,000; and in 1899 no fewer than 242 with a total
  capital of £31,378,655. Budapest owes its great commercial importance to
  its situation on the Danube, on which the greater part of its trade is
  carried. The introduction of steamboats on the Danube in 1830 was one of
  the earliest material causes of the progress of Budapest, and gave a
  great stimulus to its corn trade. This still continues to operate, having
  been promoted by the flour-milling industry, which was revolutionized by
  certain local inventions. Budapest is actually one of the greatest
  milling centres in the world, possessing a number of magnificent
  establishments, fitted with machinery invented and manufactured in the
  city. Budapest is, besides, connected with all the principal places in
  Austria and Hungary by a well-developed net of railways, which all
  radiate from here.</p>

  <p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;Few European towns grew so rapidly as
  Budapest generally, and Pest particularly, during the 19th century, and
  probably none has witnessed such a thorough transformation since 1867. In
  1799 the joint population of Buda and Pest was 54,179, of which 24,306
  belonged to Buda, and 29,870 belonged to Pest, being the first time that
  the population of Pest exceeded that of Buda. By 1840, however, Buda had
  added but 14,000 to its population while that of Pest had more than
  doubled; and of the joint population of 270,685 in 1869, fully 200,000
  fell to the share of Pest. In 1880 the civil population of Budapest was
  360,551, an increase since 1869 of 32%; and in 1890 it was 491,938, and
  increase of 36.57% in the decade. In the matter of the increase of its
  population alone, Budapest has only been slightly surpassed by one
  European town, namely, Berlin. Both capitals multiplied their population
  by nine in the first nine decades of the century. According to an
  interesting and instructive comparison of the growth of twenty-eight
  European cities made by Dr Joseph de Körösy, Berlin in 1890 showed an
  increase, as compared with the beginning of the century, of 818% and
  Budapest of 809%. Within the same period the increase of Paris was 343%,
  and of London 340%. In 1900 the civil population of Budapest was 716,476
  inhabitants, showing an increase of 44.82% in the decade. To this must be
  added a garrison of 15,846 men, making a total population 732,322. Of the
  total population, civil and military, 578,458 were Magyars, 104,520 were
  Germans, 25,168 were Slovaks, and the remainder was composed of
  Croatians, Servians, Rumanians, Russians, Greeks, Armenians, Gypsies,
  &amp;c. According to religion, there were 445,023 Roman Catholics, 5806
  Greek Catholics, 4422 Greek Orthodox; 67,319 were Protestants of the
  Helvetic, and 38,811 were Protestants of the Augsburg Confessions;
  168,985 were Jews, and the remainder belonged to various other creeds. A
  striking feature in the progress of Budapest is the decline in the
  death-rate, which sank from 43.4 per thousand in 1874 to 20.6 per
  thousand in 1900. In addition to the increased influx of <!-- Page 736
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page736"></a>[v.04
  p.0736]</span>persons in the prime of life, this is due largely to the
  improved water-supply and better sanitary conditions generally, including
  increased hospital accommodation.</p>

  <p><i>Social Position.</i>&mdash;Budapest is the seat of the government
  of Hungary, of the parliament, and of all the highest official
  authorities&mdash;civil, military, judicial and financial. It is the
  meeting-place, alternately with Vienna, of the Austro-Hungarian
  delegations, and it was elected to an equality with Vienna as a royal
  residence in 1892. It is the see of a Roman Catholic archbishop. The town
  is administered by an elected municipal council, which consists of 400
  members. As Paris is sometimes said to be France, so may Budapest with
  almost greater truth be said to be Hungary. Its composite population is a
  faithful reflection of the heterogeneous elements in the dominions of the
  Habsburgs, while the trade and industry of Hungary are centralized at
  Budapest in a way that can scarcely be affirmed of any other European
  capital. In virtue of its cultural institutions, it is also the
  intellectual and artistic centre of Hungary. The movement in favour of
  Magyarizing all institutions has found its strongest development in
  Budapest, where the German names have all been removed from the buildings
  and streets. The wonderful progress of Budapest is undoubtedly due to the
  revival of the Hungarian national spirit in the first half of the 19th
  century, and to the energetic and systematic efforts of the government
  and people of Hungary since the restoration of the constitution. So far
  as Hungary was concerned, Budapest in 1867 at once became the favoured
  rival of Vienna, with the important additional advantage that it had no
  such competitors within its own sphere as Vienna had in the Austrian
  provincial capitals. The political, intellectual, and social life of
  Hungary was centred in Budapest, and had largely been so since 1848, when
  it became the seat of the legislature, as it was that of the Austrian
  central administration which followed the revolution. The ideal of a
  prosperous, brilliant and attractive Magyar capital, which would keep the
  nobles and the intellectual flower of the country at home, uniting them
  in the service of the Fatherland, had received a powerful impetus from
  Count Stephan Széchényi, the great Hungarian reformer of the
  pre-Revolutionary period. His work, continued by patriotic and able
  successors, was now taken up as the common task of the government and the
  nation. Thus the promotion of the interests of the capital and the
  centralization of the public and commercial life of the country have
  formed an integral part of the policy of the state since the restoration
  of the constitution. Budapest has profited largely by the encouragement
  of agriculture, trade and industry, by the nationalization of the
  railways, by the development of inland navigation, and also by the
  neglect of similar measures in favour of Vienna.</p>

  <p>From that time to the present day the record of the Hungarian capital
  has been one of uninterrupted advance, not merely in externals, such as
  the removal of slums, the reconstruction of the town, the development of
  communications, industry and trade, and the erection of important public
  buildings, but also in the mental, moral and physical elevation of the
  inhabitants; besides another important gain from the point of view of the
  Hungarian statesman, namely, the progressive increase and improvement of
  status of the Magyar element of the population. When it is remembered
  that the ideal of both the authorities and the people is the ultimate
  monopoly of the home market by Hungarian industry and trade, and the
  strengthening of the Magyar influence by centralization, it is easy to
  understand the progress of Budapest.</p>

  <p>Politically, this ambitious and progressive capital is the creation of
  the Magyar upper classes. Commercially and industrially, it may be said
  to be the work of the Jews. The sound judgment of the former led them to
  welcome and appreciate the co-operation of the latter. Indeed, a
  readiness to assimilate foreign elements is characteristic of Magyar
  patriotism, which has, particularly within the last generation, made
  numerous converts among the other nationalities of Hungary, and&mdash;for
  national purposes&mdash;may be considered to have quite absorbed the
  Hungarian Jews. It has thus come to pass that there is no anti-Semitism
  in Budapest, although the Hebrew element is proportionately much larger
  (21% as compared with 9%) than it is in Vienna, the Mecca of the
  Jew-baiter.</p>

  <p>Budapest has long been celebrated for its mineral springs and baths,
  some of them having been already used during the Roman period. They rise
  at the foot of the Blocksberg, and are powerful chalybeate and
  sulphureous hot springs, with a temperature of 80°-150° Fahr. The
  principal baths are the Bruckbad and the Kaiserbad, both dating from the
  Turkish period; the St Lucasbad; and the Raitzenbad, rebuilt in 1860, one
  of the most magnificent establishments of its kind, which was connected
  through a gallery with the royal palace in the time of Matthias Corvin.
  There is an artesian well of sulphureous water with a temperature of 153°
  Fahr. in the Stadtwäldchen; and another, yielding sulphureous water with
  a temperature of 110° Fahr., which is used for both drinking and bathing,
  in the Margaret island. The mineral springs, which yield bitter alkaline
  waters, are situated in the plain south of the Blocksberg, and are over
  40 in number. The principal are the Hunyadi-János spring, of which about
  1,000,000 bottles are exported annually, the Arpad spring, and the Apenta
  spring.</p>

  <p>The largest and most popular of the parks in Budapest is the
  Városliget, on the north-east side of the town. It has an area of 286
  acres, and contains the zoological garden. On an island in its large pond
  are situated the agricultural (1902-1904) and the ethnographical museums.
  It was in this park that the millennium exhibition of 1896 took place. A
  still more delightful resort is the Margaret island, a long narrow island
  in the Danube, the property of the archduke Joseph, which has been laid
  out in the style of an English park, with fine trees, velvety turf and a
  group of villas and bath-houses. The name of the island is derived from
  St Margaret, the daughter of King Bela IV. (13th century), who built here
  a convent, the ruins of which are still in existence. To the west of Buda
  extends the hill (1463 ft.) of Sváb-Hegy (<i>Schwabenberg</i>), with
  extensive view and numerous villas; it is ascended by a rack-and-pinion
  railway. A favourite spot is the Zugliget (<i>Auwinkel</i>), a wooded
  dale on the northern slope of the hill. To the north of Ó-Buda, about 4
  m. from the Margaret island, on the right bank of the Danube, are the
  remains of the Roman colony of Aquincum. They include the foundations of
  an amphitheatre, of a temple, of an aqueduct, of baths and of a castrum.
  The objects found here are preserved in a small museum. To the north of
  Pest lies the historic Rákos field, where the Hungarian diets were held
  in the open air from the 10th to the 14th century; and 23 m. to the north
  lies the royal castle of Gödöllö, with its beautiful park.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of Budapest consists of the separate
  history of the two sister towns, Buda and Pest. The Romans founded, in
  the 2nd century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, on the right bank of the
  Danube, on the site of the actual Ó-Buda, a colony, on the place of a
  former Celtic settlement. This colony was named Aquincum, a
  transformation from the former Celtic name of <i>Ak-ink</i>, meaning
  "rich waters." The Roman occupation lasted till <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 376, and then the place was invaded by Huns,
  Ostrogoths, and later by Avars and Slavs. When the Magyars came into the
  country, at the end of the 10th century, they preserved the names of Buda
  and Pest, which they found for these two places. The origin of Pest
  proper is obscure, but the name, apparently derived from the old Slavonic
  <i>pestj</i>, a stove (like Ofen, the German name of Buda), seems to
  point to an early Slavonic settlement. The Romans never gained a foothold
  on this side of the river.</p>

  <p>When it first appears in history Pest was essentially a German
  settlement, and a chronicler of the 13th century describes it as "Villa
  Teutonica ditissima." Christianity was introduced early in the 11th
  century. In 1241 Pest was destroyed by the Tatars, after whose departure
  in 1244 it was created a royal free city by Bela IV., and repeopled with
  colonists of various nationalities. The succeeding period seems to have
  been one of considerable prosperity, though Pest was completely eclipsed
  by the sister town of Buda with its fortress and palace. This fortress
  and palace were built by King Bela IV. in 1247, and were the nucleus
  round which the town of Buda was built, which soon gained <!-- Page 737
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page737"></a>[v.04 p.0737]</span>great
  importance, and became in 1361 the capital of Hungary. In 1526 Pest was
  taken and pillaged by the Turks, and from 1541 to 1686 Buda was the seat
  of a Turkish pasha. Pest in the meantime entirely lost its importance,
  and on the departure of the Turks was left little more than a heap of
  ruins. Its favourable situation and the renewal of former privileges
  helped it to revive, and in 1723 it became the seat of the highest
  Hungarian officials. Maria Theresa and Joseph II. did much to increase
  its importance, but the rapid growth which enabled it completely to
  outstrip Buda belongs entirely to the 19th century. A signal proof of its
  vitality was given in 1838 by the speed and ease with which it recovered
  from a disastrous inundation that destroyed 3000 houses. In 1848 Pest
  became the seat of the revolutionary diet, but in the following year the
  insurgents had to retire before the Austrians under Windischgrätz. A
  little later the Austrians had to retire in their turn, leaving a
  garrison in the fortress of Buda, and, while the Hungarians endeavoured
  to capture this position, General Hentzi retaliated by bombarding Pest,
  doing great damage to the town. In 1872 both towns were united into one
  municipality. In 1896 took place here the millennium exhibition, in
  celebration of the thousandth anniversary of the foundation of the
  kingdom of Hungary.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The official publications
  of the Budapest Communal Bureau of Statistics have acquired a European
  repute for their completeness, and their fearless exposure of
  shortcomings has been an element in the progress of the town. Reference
  should also be made to separate works of the director of that
  institution, Dr Joseph de Körösy, known in England for his discovery of
  the law of marital fertility, published by the Royal Society, and by his
  labours in the development of comparative international statistics. His
  <i>Statistique Internationale des grandes villes</i> and <i>Bulletin
  annuel des finances des grandes villes</i> give valuable comparative
  data. See also <i>Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie in Wort und

  <p><b>BUDAUN,</b> a town and district of British India, in the Rohilkhand
  division of the United Provinces. The town is near the left bank of the
  river Sot. Pop. (1901) 39,031. There are ruins of an immense fort and a
  very handsome mosque of imposing size, crowned with a dome, and built in
  1223 in great part from the materials of an ancient Hindu temple. The
  American Methodist mission maintains several girls' schools, and there is
  a high school for boys. According to tradition Budaun was founded about
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 905, and an inscription, probably of the
  12th century, gives a list of twelve Rathor kings reigning at Budaun
  (called Vodamayuta). The first authentic historical event connected with
  it, however, is its capture by Kutb-ud-din in 1196, after which it became
  a very important post on the northern frontier of the Delhi empire. In
  the 13th century two of its governors, Shams-ud-din Altamsh, the builder
  of the great mosque referred to above, and his son Rukn-ud-din Firoz,
  attained the imperial throne. In 1571 the town was burnt, and about a
  hundred years later, under Shah Jahan, the seat of the governorship was
  transferred to Bareilly; after which the importance of Budaun declined.
  It ultimately came into the power of the Rohillas, and in 1838 was made
  the headquarters of a British district. In 1857 the people of Budaun
  sided with the mutineers, and a native government was set up, which
  lasted until General Penny's victory at Kakrala (April 1858) led to the
  restoration of British authority.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">District Of Budaun</span> has an area of 1987 sq.
  m. Pop. (1901) 1,025,753. The country is low, level, and is generally
  fertile, and watered by the Ganges, the Ramganga, the Sot or Yarwafadar,
  and the Mahawa. Budaun district was ceded to the British government in
  1801 by the nawab of Oudh. There are several indigo factories. The
  district is crossed by two lines of the Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand railway,
  and by a narrow-gauge line from Bareilly. The chief centre of trade is
  Bilsi.</p>

  <p><b>BUDDEUS, JOHANN FRANZ</b> (1667-1729), German Lutheran divine, was
  born at Anklam, a town of Pomerania, where his father was pastor. He
  studied with great distinction at Greifswald and at Wittenberg, and
  having made a special study of languages, theology and history, was
  appointed professor of Greek and Latin at Coburg in 1692, professor of
  moral philosophy in the university of Halle in 1693, and in 1705
  professor of theology at Jena. Here he was held in high esteem, and in
  1715 became Primarius of his faculty and member of the Consistory. His
  principal works are: <i>Leipzig, allgemeines historisches Lexikon</i>
  (Leipzig, 1709 ff.); <i>Historia, Ecclesiastica Veteris Testamenti</i> (4
  vols., Halle, 1709); <i>Elementa Philosophiae Practicae, Instrumentalis,
  et Theoreticae</i> (3 vols., 1697); <i>Selecta Juris Naturae et
  Gentium</i> (Halle, 1704); <i>Miscellanea Sacra</i> (3 vols., Jena,
  1727); and <i>Isagoge Historico-Theologica ad Theologiam Universam,
  singulasque ejus partes</i> (2 vols., 1727).</p>

  <p><b>BUDDHA.</b> According to the Buddhist theory (see <span
  class="sc">Buddhism</span>), a "Buddha" appears from time to time in the
  world and preaches the true doctrine. After a certain lapse of time this
  teaching is corrupted and lost, and is not restored till a new Buddha
  appears. In Europe, Buddha is used to designate the last historical
  Buddha, whose family name was Gotama, and who was the son of
  Suddh&#x14D;dana, one of the chiefs of the tribe of the S&#x101;kiyas,
  one of the republican clans then still existent in India.</p>

  <p>We are accustomed to find the legendary and the miraculous gathering,
  like a halo, around the early history of religious leaders, until the
  sober truth runs the risk of being altogether neglected for the
  glittering and edifying falsehood. The Buddha has not escaped the fate
  which has befallen the founders of other religions; and as late as the
  year 1854 Professor Wilson of Oxford read a paper before the Royal
  Asiatic Society of London in which he maintained that the supposed life
  of Buddha was a myth, and "Buddha himself merely an imaginary being." No
  one, however, would now support this view; and it is admitted that, under
  the mass of miraculous tales which have been handed down regarding him,
  there is a basis of truth already sufficiently clear to render possible
  an intelligent history.</p>

  <p>The circumstances under which the future Buddha was born were somewhat
  as follows.<a name="FnAnchor_291" href="#Footnote_291"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  In the 6th century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> the &#x100;ryan tribes
  had long been settled far down the valley of the Ganges. The old
  child-like joy in life so manifest in the Vedas had died away; the
  worship of nature had developed or degenerated into the worship of new
  and less pure divinities; and the Vedic songs themselves, whose freedom
  was little compatible with the spirit of the age, had faded into an
  obscurity which did not lessen their value to the priests. The country
  was politically split up into little principalities, most of them
  governed by some petty despot, whose interests were not often the same as
  those of the community. There were still, however, about a dozen free
  republics, most of them with aristocratic government, and it was in these
  that reforming movements met with most approval and support. A convenient
  belief in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls satisfied the
  unfortunate that their woes were the natural result of their own deeds in
  a former birth, and, though unavoidable now, might be escaped in a future
  state of existence by present good conduct. While hoping for a better
  fate in their next birth, the poor turned for succour and advice in this
  to the aid of astrology, witchcraft and animism&mdash;a belief in which
  seems to underlie all <!-- Page 738 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page738"></a>[v.04 p.0738]</span>religions, and still survives even
  in England.<a name="FnAnchor_292" href="#Footnote_292"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
  The inspiriting wars against the enemies of the &#x100;ryan people, the
  infidel deniers of the &#x100;ryan gods, had given place to a succession
  of internecine feuds between the chiefs of neighbouring clans. In
  literature an age of poets had long since made way for an age of
  commentators and grammarians, who thought that the old poems must have
  been the work of gods. But the darkest period was succeeded by the dawn
  of a reformation; travelling logicians were willing to maintain these
  against all the world; whilst here and there ascetics strove to raise
  themselves above the gods, and hermits earnestly sought for some
  satisfactory solution of the mysteries of life. These were the teachers
  whom the people chiefly delighted to honour. Though the ranks of the
  priesthood were for ever firmly closed against intruders, a man of lay
  birth, a Kshatriya or Vaisya, whose mind revolted against the orthodox
  creed, and whose heart was stirred by mingled zeal and ambition, might
  find through these irregular orders an entrance to the career of a
  religious teacher and reformer.</p>

  <p>The S&#x101;kiya clan was then seated in a tract of country probably
  two or three thousand square miles in extent, the chief town of which was
  Kapilavastu, situate about 27° 37&prime; N. by 83° 11&prime; E., some
  days' journey north of Benares. Their territory stretched up into the
  lower slopes of the mountains, and was mostly in what is now Nepal, but
  it included territory now on the British side of the frontier. It is in
  this part of the S&#x101;kiya country that the interesting discovery was
  made of the monument they erected to their famous clansman. From their
  well-watered rice-fields, the main source of their wealth, they could see
  the giant Him&#x101;layas looming up against the clear blue of the Indian
  sky. Their supplies of water were drawn from the river Rohini, the modern
  Koh&#x101;na; and though the use of the river was in times of drought the
  cause of disputes between the S&#x101;kiyas and the neighbouring
  Koliyans, the two clans were then at peace; and two daughters of a
  chieftain of Koli, which was only 11 m. east of Kapilavastu, were the
  principal wives of Suddh&#x14D;dana. Both were childless, and great was
  the rejoicing when, in about the forty-fifth year of her age, the elder
  sister, Mah&#x101; M&#x101;y&#x101;, promised her husband a son. In due
  time she started with the intention of being confined at her parents'
  home, but the party halting on the way under the shade of some lofty
  satin-trees, in a pleasant garden called Lumbini on the river-side, her
  son, the future Buddha, was there unexpectedly born. The exact site of
  this garden has been recently rediscovered, marked by an inscribed pillar
  put up by Asoka (see <i>J.R.A.S.</i>, 1898).</p>

  <p>He was in after years more generally known by his family name of
  Gotama, but his individual name was Siddhattha. When he was nineteen
  years old he was married to his cousin Yasodhar&#x101;, daughter of a
  Koliyan chief, and gave himself up to a life of luxury. This is the
  solitary record of his youth; we hear nothing more till, in his
  twenty-ninth year, it is related that, driving to his pleasure-grounds
  one day, he was struck by the sight of a man utterly broken down by age,
  on another occasion by the sight of a man suffering from a loathsome
  disease, and some months after by the horrible sight of a decomposing
  corpse. Each time his charioteer, whose name was Channa, told him that
  such was the fate of all living beings. Soon after he saw an ascetic
  walking in a calm and dignified manner, and asking who that was, was told
  by his charioteer the character and aims of the Wanderers, the travelling
  teachers, who played so great a part in the intellectual life of the
  time. The different accounts of these visions vary so much as to cast
  great doubts on their accuracy; and the oldest one of all
  (<i>Anguttara</i>, i. 145) speaks of ideas only, not of actual visions.
  It is, however, clear from what follows, that about this time the mind of
  the young Räjput must, from some cause or other, have been deeply
  stirred. Many an earnest heart full of disappointment or enthusiasm has
  gone through a similar struggle, has learnt to look upon all earthly
  gains and hopes as worse than vanity, has envied the calm life of the
  cloister, troubled by none of these things, and has longed for an
  opportunity of entire self-surrender to abstinence and meditation.</p>

  <p>Subjectively, though not objectively, these visions may be supposed to
  have appeared to Gotama. After seeing the last of them, he is said, in
  the later accounts, to have spent the afternoon in his pleasure-grounds
  by the river-side; and having bathed, to have entered his chariot in
  order to return home. Just then a messenger arrived with the news that
  his wife Yasodhara had given birth to a son, his only child. "This," said
  Gotama quietly, "is a new and strong tie I shall have to break." But the
  people of Kapilavastu were greatly delighted at the birth of the young
  heir, the raja's only grandson. Gotama's return became an ovation;
  musicians preceded and followed his chariot, while shouts of joy and
  triumph fell on his ear. Among these sounds one especially attracted his
  attention. It was the voice of a young girl, his cousin, who sang a
  stanza, saying, "Happy the father, happy the mother, happy the wife of
  such a son and husband." In the word "happy" lay a double meaning; it
  meant also freed from the chains of rebirth, delivered, <i>saved</i>.
  Grateful to one who, at such a time, reminded him of his highest hopes,
  Gotama, to whom such things had no longer any value, took off his collar
  of pearls and sent it to her. She imagined that this was the beginning of
  a courtship, and began to build daydreams about becoming his principal
  wife, but he took no further notice of her and passed on. That evening
  the dancing-girls came to go through the Natch dances, then as now so
  common on festive occasions in many parts of India; but he paid them no
  attention, and gradually fell into an uneasy slumber. At midnight he
  awoke; the dancing-girls were lying in the ante-room; an overpowering
  loathing filled his soul. He arose instantly with a mind fully made
  up&mdash;"roused into activity," says the Sinhalese chronicle, "like a
  man who is told that his house is on fire." He called out to know who was
  on guard, and finding it was his charioteer Channa, he told him to saddle
  his horse. While Channa was gone Siddhattha gently opened the door of the
  room where Yasodhara was sleeping, surrounded by flowers, with one hand
  on the head of their child. He had hoped to take the babe in his arms for
  the last time before he went, but now he stood for a few moments
  irresolute on the threshold looking at them. At last the fear of
  awakening Yasodhara prevailed; he tore himself away, promising himself to
  return to them as soon as his mind had become clear, as soon as he had
  become a Buddha,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> Enlightened,&mdash;and then he could
  return to them not only as husband and father, but as teacher and
  saviour. It is said to have been broad moonlight on the full moon of the
  month of July, when the young chief, with Channa as his sole companion,
  leaving his father's home, his wealth and social position, his wife and
  child behind him, went out into the wilderness to become a penniless and
  despised student, and a homeless wanderer. This is the circumstance which
  has given its name to a Sanskrit work, the Mahabhinishkramana Sutra, or
  Sutra of the Great Renunciation.</p>

  <p>Next is related an event in which we may again see a subjective
  experience given under the form of an objective reality. Mara, the great
  tempter, appears in the sky, and urges Gotama to stop, promising him, in
  seven days, a universal kingdom over the four great continents if he will
  but give up his enterprise.<a name="FnAnchor_293"
  href="#Footnote_293"><sup>[3]</sup></a> When his words fail to have any
  effect, the tempter consoles himself by the confident hope that he will
  still overcome his enemy, saying, "Sooner or later some lustful or
  malicious or angry thought must arise in his mind; in that moment I shall
  be his master"; and from that hour, adds the legend, "as a shadow always
  follows the body, so he too from that day always followed the Blessed
  One, striving to throw every obstacle in his way towards the Buddhahood."
  Gotama rides a long distance that night, only stopping at the banks of
  the Anoma beyond the Koliyan territory. There, on the sandy bank of the
  river, at a spot where later piety erected a dagaba (a solid dome-shaped
  relic shrine), he cuts off with his sword his long flowing locks, and,
  taking off his ornaments, sends them and the horse back in charge of the
  unwilling Channa to Kapilavastu. The next seven days were spent alone in
  a grove of mango trees <!-- Page 739 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page739"></a>[v.04 p.0739]</span>near by, whence the recluse walks
  on to Rajagriha, the capital of Magadha, and residence of Bimbisara, one
  of the then most powerful rulers in the valley of the Ganges. He was
  favourably received by the raja; but though asked to do so, he would not
  as yet assume the responsibilities of a teacher. He attached himself
  first to a brahmin sophist named Alara, and afterwards to another named
  Udraka, from whom he learnt all that Indian philosophy had then to teach.
  Still unsatisfied, he next retired to the jungle of Uruvela, on the most
  northerly spur of the Vindhya range of mountains, and there for six
  years, attended by five faithful disciples, he gave himself up to the
  severest penance and self-torture, till his fame as an ascetic spread in
  all the country round about "like the sound," says the Burmese chronicle,
  "of a great bell hung in the canopy of the skies."<a name="FnAnchor_294"
  href="#Footnote_294"><sup>[4]</sup></a> At last one day, when he was
  walking in a much enfeebled state, he felt on a sudden an extreme
  weakness, like that caused by dire starvation, and unable to stand any
  longer he fell to the ground. Some thought he was dead, but he recovered,
  and from that time took regular food and gave up his severe penance, so
  much so that his five disciples soon ceased to respect him, and leaving
  him went to Benares.</p>

  <p>There now ensued a second struggle in Gotama's mind, described with
  all the wealth of poetry and imagination of which the Indian mind is
  master. The crisis culminated on a day, each event of which is surrounded
  in the Buddhist accounts with the wildest legends, on which the very
  thoughts passing through the mind of Buddha appear in gorgeous
  descriptions as angels of darkness or of light. To us, now taught by the
  experiences of centuries how weak such exaggerations are compared with
  the effect of a plain unvarnished tale, these legends may appear childish
  or absurd, but they have a depth of meaning to those who strive to read
  between the lines of such rude and inarticulate attempts to describe the
  indescribable. That which (the previous and subsequent career of the
  teacher being borne in mind) seems to be possible and even probable,
  appears to be somewhat as follows.</p>

  <p>Disenchanted and dissatisfied, Gotama had given up all that most men
  value, to seek peace in secluded study and self-denial. Failing to attain
  his object by learning the wisdom of others, and living the simple life
  of a student, he had devoted himself to that intense meditation and
  penance which all philosophers then said would raise men above the gods.
  Still unsatisfied, longing always for a certainty that seemed ever just
  beyond his grasp, he had added vigil to vigil, and penance to penance,
  until at last, when to the wondering view of others he had become more
  than a saint, his bodily strength and his indomitable resolution and
  faith had together suddenly and completely broken down. Then, when the
  sympathy of others would have been most welcome, he found his friends
  falling away from him, and his disciples leaving him for other teachers.
  Soon after, if not on the very day when his followers had left him, he
  wandered out towards the banks of the Neranjara, receiving his morning
  meal from the hands of Sujata, the daughter of a neighbouring villager,
  and set himself down to eat it under the shade of a large tree (a
  <i>Ficus religiosa</i>), to be known from that time as the sacred Bo tree
  or tree of wisdom. There he remained through the long hours of that day
  debating with himself what next to do. All his old temptations came back
  upon him with renewed force. For years he had looked at all earthly good
  through the medium of a philosophy which taught him that it, without
  exception, contained within itself the seeds of bitterness, and was
  altogether worthless and impermanent; but now to his wavering faith the
  sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to
  show themselves in a different light, and glow again with attractive
  colours. He doubted, and agonized in his doubt; but as the sun set, the
  religious side of his nature had won the victory, and seems to have come
  out even purified from the struggle. He had attained to Nirvana, had
  become clear in his mind, a Buddha, an Enlightened One. From that night
  he not only did not claim any merit on account of his self-mortification,
  but took every opportunity of declaring that from such penances no
  advantage at all would be derived. All that night he is said to have
  remained in deep meditation under the Bo tree; and the orthodox Buddhists
  believe that for seven times seven nights and days he continued fasting
  near the spot, when the archangel Brahm&#x101; came and ministered to
  him. As for himself, his heart was now fixed,&mdash;his mind was made
  up,&mdash;but he realized more than he had ever done before the power of
  temptation, and the difficulty, the almost impossibility, of
  understanding and holding to the truth. For others subject to the same
  temptations, but without that earnestness and insight which he felt
  himself to possess, faith might be quite impossible, and it would only be
  waste of time and trouble to try to show to them "the only path of
  peace." To one in his position this thought would be so very natural,
  that we need not hesitate to accept the fact of its occurrence as related
  in the oldest records. It is quite consistent with his whole career that
  it was love and pity for others&mdash;otherwise, as it seemed to him,
  helplessly doomed and lost&mdash;-which at last overcame every other
  consideration, and made Gotama resolve to announce his doctrine to the
  world.</p>

  <p>The teacher, now 35 years of age, intended to proclaim his new gospel
  first to his old teachers &#x100;l&#x101;ra and Udraka, but finding that
  they were dead, he determined to address himself to his former five
  disciples, and accordingly went to the Deer-forest near Benares where
  they were then living. An old <i>g&#x101;thh&#x101;</i>, or hymn
  (translated in <i>Vinaya Texts</i>, i. 90) tells us how the Buddha, rapt
  with the idea of his great mission, meets an acquaintance, one Upaka, a
  wandering sophist, on the way. The latter, struck with his expression,
  asks him whose religion it is that makes him so glad, and yet so calm.
  The reply is striking. "I am now on my way," says the Buddha, "to the
  city of Benares, to beat the drum of the Ambrosia (to set up the light of
  the doctrine of Nirvana) in the darkness of the world!" and he proclaims
  himself the Buddha who alone knows, and knows no teacher. Upaka says:
  "You profess yourself, then, friend, to be an Arahat and a conqueror?"
  The Buddha says: "Those indeed are conquerors who, as I have now, have
  conquered the intoxications (the mental intoxication arising from
  ignorance, sensuality or craving after future life). Evil dispositions
  have ceased in me; therefore is it that I am conqueror!" His acquaintance
  rejoins: "In that case, venerable Gotama, your way lies yonder!" and he
  himself, shaking his head, turns in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Nothing daunted, the new prophet walked on to Benares, and in the cool
  of the evening went on to the Deer-forest where the five ascetics were
  living. Seeing him coming, they resolved not to recognize as a superior
  one who had broken his vows; to address him by his name, and not as
  "master" or "teacher"; only, he being a Kshatriya, to offer him a seat.
  He understands their change of manner, calmly tells them not to mock him
  by calling him "the venerable Gotama"; that he has found the ambrosia of
  truth and can lead them to it. They object, naturally enough, from the
  ascetic point of view, that he had failed before while he was keeping his
  body under, and how can his mind have won the victory now, when he serves
  and yields to his body. Buddha replies by explaining to them the
  principles of his new gospel, in the form of noble truths, and the Noble
  Eightfold Path (see <span class="sc">Buddhism</span>).</p>

  <p>It is nearly certain that Buddha had a commanding presence, and one of
  those deep, rich, thrilling voices which so many of the successful
  leaders of men have possessed. We know his deep earnestness, and his
  thorough conviction of the truth of his new gospel. When we further
  remember the relation which the five students mentioned above had long
  borne to him, and that they had passed through a similar culture, it is
  not difficult to understand that his persuasions were successful, and
  that his old disciples were the first to acknowledge him in his new
  character. The later books say that they were all converted at once; but,
  according to the most ancient P&#x101;li record&mdash;though their old
  love and reverence had been so rekindled when the Buddha came near that
  their cold resolutions quite broke down, and they vied with each other in
  such acts of personal attention as an <!-- Page 740 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page740"></a>[v.04 p.0740]</span>Indian disciple
  loves to pay to his teacher,&mdash;yet it was only after the Buddha had
  for five days talked to them, sometimes separately, sometimes together,
  that they accepted in its entirety his plan of salvation.<a
  name="FnAnchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Buddha then remained at the Deer-forest near Benares until the
  number of his personal followers was about threescore, and that of the
  outside believers somewhat greater. The principal among the former was a
  rich young man named Yasa, who had first come to him at night out of fear
  of his relations, and afterwards shaved his head, put on the yellow robe,
  and succeeded in bringing many of his former friends and companions to
  the teacher, his mother and his wife being the first female disciples,
  and his father the first lay devotee. It should be noticed in passing
  that the idea of a priesthood with mystical powers is altogether
  repugnant to Buddhism; every one's salvation is entirely dependent on the
  modification or growth of his own inner nature, resulting from his own
  exertions. The life of a recluse is held to be the most conducive to that
  state of sweet serenity at which the most ardent disciples aim; but that
  of a layman, of a believing householder, is held in high honour; and a
  believer who does not as yet feel himself able or willing to cast off the
  ties of home or of business, may yet "enter the paths," and by a life of
  rectitude and kindness ensure for himself a rebirth under more favourable
  conditions for his growth in holiness.</p>

  <p>After the rainy season Gotama called together those of his disciples
  who had devoted themselves to the higher life, and said to them: "I am
  free from the five hindrances which, like an immense net, hold men and
  angels in their power; you too (owing to my teaching) are set free. Go ye
  now, brethren, and wander for the gain and welfare of the many, out of
  compassion for the world, to the benefit of gods and men. Preach the
  doctrine, beauteous in inception, beauteous in continuation, beauteous in
  its end. Proclaim the pure and perfect life. Let no two go together. I
  also go, brethren, to the General's village in the wilds of
  Uruvel&#x101;."<a name="FnAnchor_296"
  href="#Footnote_296"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Throughout his career, Gotama
  yearly adopted the same plan, collecting his disciples round him in the
  rainy season, and after it was over travelling about as an itinerant
  preacher; but in subsequent years he was always accompanied by some of
  his most attached disciples.</p>

  <p>In the solitudes of Uruvel&#x101; there were at this time three
  brothers, fire-worshippers and hermit philosophers, who had gathered
  round them a number of scholars, and enjoyed a considerable reputation as
  teachers. Gotama settled among them, and after a time they became
  believers in his system,&mdash;the elder brother, Kassapa, taking
  henceforth a principal place among his followers. His first set sermon to
  his new disciples is called by Bishop Bigandet the Sermon on the Mount.
  Its subject was a jungle-fire which broke out on the opposite hillside.
  He warned his hearers against the fires of concupiscence, anger,
  ignorance, birth, death, decay and anxiety; and taking each of the senses
  in order he compared all human sensations to a burning flame which seems
  to be something it is not, which produces pleasure and pain, but passes
  rapidly away, and ends only in destruction.<a name="FnAnchor_297"
  href="#Footnote_297"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Accompanied by his new disciples, the Buddha walked on to
  R&#x101;jagaha, the capital of King Bimbis&#x101;ra, who, not unmindful
  of their former interview, came out to welcome him. Seeing Kassapa, who
  as the chronicle puts it, was as well known to them as the banner of the
  city, the people at first doubted who was the teacher and who the
  disciple, but Kassapa put an end to their hesitation by stating that he
  had now given up his belief in the efficacy of sacrifices either great or
  small; that Nirv&#x101;na was a state of rest to be attained only by a
  change of heart; and that he had become a disciple of the Buddha. Gotama
  then spoke to the king on the miseries of the world which arise from
  passion, and on the possibility of release by following the way of
  salvation. The r&#x101;ja invited him and his disciples to eat their
  simple mid-day meal at his house on the following morning; and then
  presented the Buddha with a garden called Veluvana or Bamboo-grove,
  afterwards celebrated as the place where the Buddha spent many rainy
  seasons, and preached many of his most complete discourses. There he
  taught for some time, attracting large numbers of hearers, among whom
  two, S&#x101;riputta and Moggall&#x101;na, who afterwards became
  conspicuous leaders in the new crusade, then joined the Sangha or
  Society, as the Buddha's order of mendicants was called.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the prophet's father, Suddh&#x14D;dana, who had anxiously
  watched his son's career, heard that he had given up his asceticism, and
  had appeared as a Wanderer, an itinerant preacher and teacher. He sent
  therefore to him, urging him to come home, that he might see him once
  more before he died. The Buddha accordingly started for Kapilavastu, and
  stopped according to his custom in a grove outside the town. His father
  and uncles and others came to see him there, but the latter were angry,
  and would pay him no reverence. It was the custom to invite such teachers
  and their disciples for the next day's meal, but they all left without
  doing so. The next day, therefore, Gotama set out at the usual hour,
  carrying his bowl to beg for a meal. As he entered the city, he hesitated
  whether he should not go straight to his father's house, but determined
  to adhere to his custom. It soon reached his father's ears that his son
  was walking through the streets begging. Startled at such news he rose
  up, seizing the end of his outer robe, and hastened to the place where
  Gotama was, exclaiming, "Illustrious Buddha, why do you expose us all to
  such shame? Is it necessary to go from door to door begging your food? Do
  you imagine that I am not able to supply the wants of so many
  mendicants?" "My noble father," was the reply, "this is the custom of all
  our race." "How so?" said his father. "Are you not descended from an
  illustrious line? no single person of our race has ever acted so
  indecorously." "My noble father," said Gotama, "you and your family may
  claim the privileges of Kshatriya descent; my descent is from the
  prophets (Buddhas) of old, and they have always acted so; the customs of
  the law (Dharma) are good both for this world and the world that is to
  come. But, my father, when a man has found a treasure, it is his duty to
  offer the most precious of the jewels to his father first. Do not delay,
  let me share with you the treasure I have found." Suddh&#x14D;dana,
  abashed, took his son's bowl and led him to his house.</p>

  <p>Eighteen months had now elapsed since the turning-point of Gotama's
  career&mdash;his great struggle under the Bo tree. Thus far all the
  accounts follow chronological order. From this time they simply narrate
  disconnected stories about the Buddha, or the persons with whom he was
  brought into contact,&mdash;the same story being usually found in more
  than one account, but not often in the same order. It is not as yet
  possible, except very partially, to arrange chronologically the snatches
  of biography to be gleaned from these stories. They are mostly told to
  show the occasion on which some memorable act of the Buddha took place,
  or some memorable saying was uttered, and are as exact as to place as
  they are indistinct as to time. It would be impossible within the limits
  of this article to give any large number of them, but space may be found
  for one or two.</p>

  <p>A merchant from S&#x16B;naparanta having joined the Society was
  desirous of preaching to his relations, and is said to have asked
  Gotama's permission to do so. "The people of S&#x16B;naparanta," said the
  teacher, "are exceedingly violent. If they revile you what will you do?"
  "I will make no reply," said the mendicant. "And if they strike you?" "I
  will not strike in return," was the reply. "And if they try to kill you?"
  "Death is no evil in itself; many even desire it, to escape from the
  vanities of life, but I shall take no steps either to hasten or to delay
  the time of my departure." These answers were held satisfactory, and the
  monk started on his mission.</p>

  <p>At another time a rich farmer held a harvest home, and the Buddha,
  wishing to preach to him, is said to have taken his alms-bowl and stood
  by the side of the field and begged. The farmer, a wealthy br&#x101;hmin,
  said to him, "Why do you come and beg? <!-- Page 741 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page741"></a>[v.04 p.0741]</span>I plough and
  sow and earn my food; you should do the same." "I too, O brahmin," said
  the beggar, "plough and sow; and having ploughed and sown I eat." "You
  profess only to be a farmer; no one sees your ploughing, what do you
  mean?" said the brahmin. "For my cultivation," said the beggar, "faith is
  the seed, self-combat is the fertilizing rain, the weeds I destroy are
  the cleaving to existence, wisdom is my plough, and its guiding-shaft is
  modesty; perseverance draws my plough, and I guide it with the rein of my
  mind; the field I work is in the law, and the harvest that I reap is the
  never-dying nectar of Nirv&#x101;na, Those who reap this harvest destroy
  all the weeds of sorrow."</p>

  <p>On another occasion he is said to have brought back to her right mind
  a young mother whom sorrow had for a time deprived of reason. Her name
  was Kis&#x101;gotam&#x12B;. She had been married early, as is the custom
  in the East, and had a child when she was still a girl. When the
  beautiful boy could run alone he died. The young girl in her love for it
  carried the dead child clasped to her bosom, and went from house to house
  of her pitying friends asking them to give her medicine for it. But a
  Buddhist convert thinking "she does not understand," said to her, "My
  good girl, I myself have no such medicine as you ask for, but I think I
  know of one who has." "Oh, tell me who that is?" said
  Kis&#x101;gotam&#x12B;. "The Buddha can give you medicine; go to him,"
  was the answer. She went to Gotama; and doing homage to him said, "Lord
  and master, do you know any medicine that will be good for my child?"
  "Yes, I know of some," said the teacher. Now it was the custom for
  patients or their friends to provide the herbs which the doctors
  required; so she asked what herbs he would want. "I want some
  mustard-seed," he said; and when the poor girl eagerly promised to bring
  some of so common a drug, he added, "you must get it from some house
  where no son, or husband, or parent or slave has died." "Very good," she
  said; and went to ask for it, still carrying her dead child with her. The
  people said, "Here is mustard-seed, take it"; but when she asked, "In my
  friend's house has any son died, or a husband, or a parent or slave?"
  They answered, "Lady! what is this that you say? the living are few, but
  the dead are many." Then she went to other houses, but one said "I have
  lost a son," another "We have lost our parents," another "I have lost my
  slave." At last, not being able to find a single house where no one had
  died, her mind began to clear, and summoning up resolution she left the
  dead body of her child in a forest, and returning to the Buddha paid him
  homage. He said to her, "Have you the mustard-seed?" "My lord," she
  replied, "I have not; the people tell me that the living are few, but the
  dead are many." Then he talked to her on that essential part of his
  system, the impermanency of all things, till her doubts were cleared
  away, she accepted her lot, became a disciple, and entered the "first
  path."</p>

  <p>For forty-five years after entering on his mission Gotama itinerated
  in the valley of the Ganges, not going farther than about 250 m. from
  Benares, and always spending the rainy months at one spot&mdash;usually
  at one of the <i>viharas</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_298"
  href="#Footnote_298"><sup>[8]</sup></a> or homes, which had been given to
  the society. In the twentieth year his cousin &#x100;nanda became a
  mendicant, and from that time seems to have attended on the Buddha, being
  constantly near him, and delighting to render him all the personal
  service which love and reverence could suggest. Another cousin,
  Devadatta, the son of the r&#x101;ja of Koli, also joined the society,
  but became envious of the teacher, and stirred up Ajatasattu (who, having
  killed his father Bimbisara, had become king of Rajagaha) to persecute
  Gotama. The account of the manner in which the Buddha is said to have
  overcome the wicked devices of this apostate cousin and his parricide
  protector is quite legendary; but the general fact of Ajatasattu's
  opposition to the new sect and of his subsequent conversion may be
  accepted.</p>

  <p>The confused and legendary notices of the journeyings of Gotama are
  succeeded by tolerably clear accounts of the last few days of his life.<a
  name="FnAnchor_299" href="#Footnote_299"><sup>[9]</sup></a> On a journey
  towards Kusin&#x101;r&#x101;, a town about 120 m. north-north-east of
  Benares, and about 80 m. due east of Kapilavastu, the teacher, being then
  eighty years of age, had rested for a short time in a grove at
  P&#x101;w&#x101;, presented to the society by a goldsmith of that place
  named Chunda. Chunda prepared for the mendicants a mid-day meal, and
  after the meal the Buddha started for Kusin&#x101;r&#x101;. He had not
  gone far when he was obliged to rest, and soon afterwards he said,
  "&#x100;nanda, I am thirsty," and they gave him water to drink. Half-way
  between the two towns flows the river Kukusht&#x101;. There Gotama rested
  again, and bathed for the last time. Feeling that he was dying, and
  careful lest Chunda should be reproached by himself or others, he said to
  &#x100;nanda, "After I am gone tell Chunda that he will receive in a
  future birth very great reward; for, having eaten of the food he gave me,
  I am about to die; and if he should still doubt, say that it was from my
  own mouth that you heard this. There are two gifts which will be blest
  above all others, namely, Suj&#x101;t&#x101;'s gift before I attained
  wisdom under the Bo tree, and this gift of Chunda's before I pass away."
  After halting again and again the party at length reached the river
  Hiranyavati, close by Kusin&#x101;r&#x101;, and there for the last time
  the teacher rested. Lying down under some Sal trees, with his face
  towards the south, he talked long and earnestly with &#x100;nanda about
  his burial, and about certain rules which were to be observed by the
  society after his death. Towards the end of this conversation, when it
  was evening, &#x100;nanda broke down and went aside to weep, but the
  Buddha missed him, and sending for him comforted him with the promise of
  Nirv&#x101;na, and repeated what he had so often said before about the
  impermanence of all things,&mdash;"O &#x100;nanda! do not weep; do not
  let yourself be troubled. You known what I have said; sooner or later we
  must part from all we hold most dear. This body of ours contains within
  itself the power which renews its strength for a time, but also the
  causes which lead to its destruction. Is there anything put together
  which shall not dissolve? But you, too, shall be free from this delusion,
  this world of sense, this law of change. Beloved," added he, speaking to
  the rest of the disciples, "&#x100;nanda for long years has served me
  with devoted affection." And he spoke to them at some length on the
  kindness of &#x100;nanda.</p>

  <p>About midnight Subhadra, a brahmin philosopher of
  Kusin&#x101;r&#x101;, came to ask some questions of the Buddha, but
  &#x100;nanda, fearing that this might lead to a longer discussion than
  the sick teacher could bear, would not admit him. Gotama heard the sound
  of their talk, and asking what it was, told them to let Subhadra come.
  The latter began by asking whether the six great teachers knew all laws,
  or whether there were some that they did not know, or knew only
  partially. "This is not the time," was the answer, "for such discussions.
  To true wisdom there is only one way, the path that is laid down in my
  system. Many have already followed it, and conquering the lust and pride
  and anger of their own hearts, have become free from ignorance and doubt
  and wrong belief, have entered the calm state of universal kindliness,
  and have reached Nirv&#x101;na even in this life. O Subhadra! I do not
  speak to you of things I have not experienced. Since I was twenty-nine
  years old till now I have striven after pure and perfect wisdom, and
  following the good path, have found Nirv&#x101;na." A rule had been made
  that no follower of a rival system should be admitted to the society
  without four months' probation. So deeply did the words or the impressive
  manner of the dying teacher work upon Subhadra that he asked to be
  admitted at once, and Gotama granted his request. Then turning to his
  disciples he said, "When I have passed away and am no longer with you, do
  not think that the Buddha has left you, and is not still in your midst.
  You have my words, my explanations of the deep things of truth, the laws
  I have laid down for the society; let them be your guide; the Buddha has
  not left you." Soon afterwards he again spoke to them, urging them to
  reverence one another, and rebuked one of the disciples who spoke <!--
  Page 742 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page742"></a>[v.04
  p.0742]</span>indiscriminately all that occurred to him. Towards the
  morning he asked whether any one had any doubt about the Buddha, the law
  or the society; if so, he would clear them up. No one answered, and
  &#x100;nanda expressed his surprise that amongst so many none should
  doubt, and all be firmly attached to the law. But the Buddha laid stress
  on the final perseverance of the saints, saying that even the least among
  the disciples who had entered the first path only, still had his heart
  fixed on the way to perfection, and constantly strove after the three
  higher paths. "No doubt," he said, "can be found in the mind of a true
  disciple." After another pause he said: "Behold now, brethren, this is my
  exhortation to you. Decay is inherent in all component things. Work out,
  therefore, your emancipation with diligence!" These were the last words
  the Buddha spoke; shortly afterwards he became unconscious, and in that
  state passed away.</p>

  <p><a name="Footnote_291" href="#FnAnchor_291">[1]</a> <i>Note on the
  Date of the Buddha.</i>&mdash;The now generally accepted date of the
  Buddha is arrived at by adding together two numbers, one being the date
  of the accession of Asoka to the throne, the second being the length of
  the interval between that date and that of the death of the Buddha. The
  first figure, that of the date of Asoka, is arrived at by the mention in
  one of his edicts of certain Greek kings, as then living. The dates of
  these last are approximately known; and arguing from these dates the date
  of Asoka's accession has been fixed by various scholars (at dates varying
  only by a difference of five years more or less) at about 270 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> The second figure, the total interval between
  Asoka's accession and the Buddha's death, is given in the Ceylon
  Chronicles as 218 years. Adding these two together, the date of the
  Buddha's death would be 488 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and, as he
  was eighty years old at the time of his death, the date of his birth
  would be 568 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The dates for his death and
  birth accepted in Burma, Siam and Ceylon are about half a century
  earlier, namely, 543 and 623 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, the
  difference being in the date of Asoka's accession. It will be seen that
  the dates as adopted in Europe are approximate only, and liable to
  correction if better data are obtainable. The details of this
  chronological question are discussed at length in Professor Rhys Davids'
  <i>Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon</i> (London, 1877), where the
  previous discussions are referred to.</p>

  <p><b>BUDDHAGHOSA,</b> a celebrated Buddhist writer. He was a Brahmin by
  birth and was born near the great Bodhi tree at Budh Gay&#x101;; in north
  India about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 390, his father's name being
  Kes&#x12B;. His teacher, Revata, induced him to go to Ceylon, where the
  commentaries on the scriptures had been preserved in the Sinhalese
  language, with the object of translating them into P&#x101;li. He went
  accordingly to Anuradhapura, studied there under Sanghap&#x101;la, and
  asked leave of the fraternity there to translate the commentaries. With
  their consent he then did so, having first shown his ability by writing
  the work <i>Visuddhi Magga</i> (the Path of Purity, a kind of summary of
  Buddhist doctrine). When he had completed his many years' labours he
  returned to the neighbourhood of the Bodhi tree in north India. Before he
  came to Ceylon he had already written a book entitled
  <i>N&#x101;nodaya</i> (the Rise of Knowledge), and had commenced a
  commentary on the principal psychological manual contained in the
  <i>Pitakas</i>. This latter work he afterwards rewrote in Ceylon, as the
  present text (now published by the P&#x101;li Text Society) shows. One
  volume of the <i>Sumangala Vil&#x101;sin&#x12B;</i> (a portion of the
  commentaries mentioned above) has been edited, and extracts from his
  comment on the Buddhist canon law. This last work has been discovered in
  a nearly <span class="correction" title="'comtemporaneous' in original"
  >contemporaneous</span> Chinese translation (an edition in P&#x101;li is
  based on a comparison with that translation). The works here mentioned
  form, however, only a small portion of what Buddhaghosa wrote. His
  industry must have been prodigious. He is known to have written books
  that would fill about 20 octavo volumes of about 400 pages each; and
  there are other writings ascribed to him which may or may not be really
  his work. It is too early therefore to attempt a criticism of it. But it
  is already clear that, when made acceptable, it will be of the greatest
  value for the history of Indian literature and of Indian ideas. So much
  is uncertain at present in that history for want of definite dates that
  the voluminous writings of an author whose date is approximately certain
  will afford a standard by which the age of other writings can be tested.
  And as the original commentaries in Sinhalese are now lost his works are
  the only evidence we have of the traditions then handed down in the
  Buddhist community. The main source of our information about Buddhaghosa
  is the <i>Mah&#x101;vamsa</i>, written in Anur&#x101;dhapura about fifty
  years after he was working there. But there are numerous references to
  him in P&#x101;li books on P&#x101;li literature; and a Burmese author of
  unknown date, but possibly of the 15th century, has compiled a biography
  of him, the <i>Buddhaghos' Uppatti</i>, of little value and no critical
  judgment.</p>

  <p><b>BUDDHISM,</b> the religion held by the followers of the Buddha
  (<i>q.v.</i>), and covering a large area in India and east and central
  Asia.</p>

  <p><i>Essential Doctrines.</i>&mdash;We are fortunate in having preserved
  for us the official report of the Buddha's discourse, in which he
  expounded what he considered the main features of his system to the five
  men he first tried to win over to his new-found faith. There is no reason
  to doubt its substantial accuracy, not as to words, but as to purport. In
  any case it is what the compilers of the oldest extant documents believed
  their teacher to have regarded as the most important points in his
  teaching. Such a summary must be better than any that could now be made.
  It is incorporated into two divisions of their sacred books, first among
  the <i>suttas</i> containing the doctrine, and again in the rules of the
  society or order he founded (<i>Samyutta</i>, v. 421 = <i>Vinaya</i>, i.
  10). The gist of it, omitting a few repetitions, is as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There are two aims which he who has given up the world ought not to
  follow after&mdash;devotion, on the one hand, to those things whose
  attractions depend upon the passions, a low and pagan ideal, fit only for
  the worldly-minded, ignoble, unprofitable, and the practice on the other
  hand of asceticism, which is painful, ignoble, unprofitable. There is a
  Middle Path discovered by the Tath&#x101;gata<a name="FnAnchor_301"
  href="#Footnote_301"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&mdash;a path which opens the
  eyes, and bestows understanding, which leads to peace, to insight, to the
  higher wisdom, to Nirv&#x101;na. Verily! it is this Noble Eightfold Path;
  that is to say, Right Views, Right Aspirations, Right Speech, Right
  Conduct, Right Mode of Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and
  Right Rapture.</p>

  <p>"Now this is the Noble Truth as to suffering. Birth is attended with
  pain, decay is painful, disease is painful, death is painful. Union with
  the unpleasant is painful, painful is separation from the pleasant; and
  any craving unsatisfied, that too is painful. In brief, the five
  aggregates of clinging (that is, the conditions of individuality) are
  painful.</p>

  <p>"Now this is the Noble Truth as to the origin of suffering. Verily! it
  is the craving thirst that causes the renewal of becomings, that is
  accompanied by sensual delights, and seeks satisfaction now here, now
  there&mdash;that is to say, the craving for the gratification of the
  senses, or the craving for a future life, or the craving for
  prosperity.</p>

<p><!-- Page 743 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page743"></a>[v.04 p.0743]</span></p>

  <p>"Now this is the Noble Truth as to the passing away of pain. Verily!
  it is the passing away so that no passion remains, the giving up, the
  getting rid of, the being emancipated from, the harbouring no longer of
  this craving thirst.</p>

  <p>"Now this is the Noble Truth as to the way that leads to the passing
  away of pain. Verily! it is this Noble Eightfold Path, that is to say,
  Right Views, Right Aspirations, Right speech, conduct and mode of
  livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Rapture."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A few words follow as to the threefold way in which the speaker
  claimed to have grasped each of these Four Truths. That is all. There is
  not a word about God or the soul, not a word about the Buddha or
  Buddhism. It seems simple, almost jejune; so thin and weak that one
  wonders how it can have formed the foundation for a system so mighty in
  its historical results. But the simple words are pregnant with meaning.
  Their implications were clear enough to the hearers to whom they were
  addressed. They were not intended, however, to answer the questionings of
  a 20th-century European questioner, and are liable now to be
  misunderstood. Fortunately each word, each clause, each idea in the
  discourse is repeated, commented on, enlarged upon, almost <i>ad
  nauseam</i>, in the <i>suttas</i>, and a short comment in the light of
  those explanations may bring out the meaning that was meant.<a
  name="FnAnchor_302" href="#Footnote_302"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The passing away of pain or suffering is said to depend on an
  emancipation. And the Buddha is elsewhere (<i>Vinaya</i> ii. 239) made to
  declare: "Just as the great ocean has one taste only, the taste of salt,
  just so have this doctrine and discipline but one flavour only, the
  flavour of emancipation"; and again, "When a brother has, by himself,
  known and realized, and continues to abide, here in this visible world,
  in that emancipation of mind, in that emancipation of heart, which is
  Arahatship; that is a condition higher still and sweeter still, for the
  sake of which the brethren lead the religious life under me."<a
  name="FnAnchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The
  emancipation is found in a habit of mind, in the being free from a
  specified sort of craving that is said to be the origin of certain
  specified sorts of pain. In some European books this is completely
  spoiled by being represented as the doctrine that existence is misery,
  and that desire is to be suppressed. Nothing of the kind is said in the
  text. The description of suffering or pain is, in fact, a string of
  truisms, quite plain and indisputable until the last clause. That clause
  declares that the <i>Up&#x101;d&#x101;na Skandhas</i>, the five groups of
  the constituent parts of every individual, involve pain. Put into modern
  language this is that the conditions necessary to make an individual are
  also the conditions that necessarily give rise to sorrow. No sooner has
  an individual become separate, become an individual, than disease and
  decay begin to act upon it. Individuality involves limitation, limitation
  in its turn involves ignorance, and ignorance is the source of sorrow.
  Union with the unpleasant, separation from the pleasant, unsatisfied
  craving, are each a result of individuality. This is a deeper
  generalization than that which says, "A man is born to trouble as the
  sparks fly upward." But it is put forward as a mere statement of fact.
  And the previous history of religious belief in India would tend to show
  that emphasis was laid on the fact, less as an explanation of the origin
  of evil, than as a protest against a then current pessimistic idea that
  salvation could not be reached on earth, and must therefore be sought for
  in a rebirth in heaven, in the <i>Brahmaloka</i>. For if the
  fact&mdash;the fact that the conditions of individuality are the
  conditions, also, of pain&mdash;were admitted, then the individual there
  would still not have escaped from sorrow. If the five ascetics to whom
  the words were addressed once admitted this implication, logic would
  drive them also to admit all that followed.</p>

  <p>The threefold division of craving at the end of the second truth might
  be rendered "the lust of the flesh, the lust of life and the love of this
  present world." The two last are said elsewhere to be directed against
  two sets of thinkers called the Eternalists and the Annihilationists, who
  held respectively the everlasting-life-heresy and the
  let-us-eat-and-drink-for-tomorrow-we-die-heresy.<a name="FnAnchor_304"
  href="#Footnote_304"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This may be so, but in any case
  the division of craving would have appealed to the five hearers as
  correct.</p>

  <p>The word translated "noble" in Noble Path, Noble Truth, is
  <i>ariya</i>, which also means Aryan.<a name="FnAnchor_305"
  href="#Footnote_305"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The negative, un-Aryan, is used
  of each of the two low aims. It is possible that this rendering should
  have been introduced into the translation; but the ethical meaning,
  though still associated with the tribal meaning, had probably already
  become predominant in the language of the time.</p>

  <p>The details of the Path include several terms whose meaning and
  implication are by no means apparent at first sight. Right Views, for
  instance, means mainly right views as to the Four Truths and the Three
  Signs. Of the latter, one is identical, or nearly so, with the First
  Truth. The others are Impermanence and Non-soul (the absence of a
  soul)&mdash;both declared to be "signs" of every individual, whether god,
  animal or man. Of these two again the Impermanence has become an Indian
  rather than a Buddhist idea, and we are to a certain extent familiar with
  it also in the West. There is no Being, there is only a Becoming. The
  state of every individual is unstable, temporary, sure to pass away. Even
  in the lowest class of things, we find, in each individual, form and
  material qualities. In the higher classes there is a continually rising
  series of mental qualities also. It is the union of these that makes the
  individual. Every person, or thing, or god, is therefore a putting
  together, a compound; and in each individual, without any exception, the
  relation of its component parts is ever changing, is never the same for
  two consecutive moments. It follows that no sooner has separateness,
  individuality, begun, than dissolution, disintegration, also begins.
  There can be no individuality without a putting together: there can be no
  putting together without a becoming: there can be no becoming without a
  becoming different: and there can be no becoming different without a
  dissolution, a passing away, which sooner or later will inevitably be
  complete.</p>

  <p>Heracleitus, who was a generation or two later than the Buddha, had
  very similar ideas;<a name="FnAnchor_306"
  href="#Footnote_306"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and similar ideas are found in
  post-Buddhistic Indian works.<a name="FnAnchor_307"
  href="#Footnote_307"><sup>[7]</sup></a> But in neither case are they
  worked out in the same uncompromising way. Both in Europe, and in all
  Indian thought except the Buddhist, souls, and the gods who are made in
  imitation of souls, are considered as exceptions. To these spirits is
  attributed a Being without Becoming, an individuality without change, a
  beginning without an end. To hold any such view would, according to the
  doctrine of the Noble (or Aryan) Path, be erroneous, and the error would
  block the way against the very entrance on the Path.</p>

  <p>So important is this position in Buddhism that it is put in the
  forefront of Buddhist expositions of Buddhism. The Buddha himself is
  stated in the books to have devoted to it the very first discourse he
  addressed to the first converts.<a name="FnAnchor_308"
  href="#Footnote_308"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The first in the collection of
  the <i>Dialogues of Gotama</i> discusses, and completely, categorically,
  and systematically rejects, all the current theories about "souls." Later
  books follow these precedents. Thus the <i>Kath&#x101; Vatthu</i>, the
  latest book included in the canon, discusses points of disagreement that
  had arisen in the community. It places this question of "soul" at the
  head of all the points it deals with, and devotes to it an amount of
  space quite overshadowing all the rest.<a name="FnAnchor_309"
  href="#Footnote_309"><sup>[9]</sup></a> So also in the earliest Buddhist
  book later than the canon&mdash;the very interesting and suggestive
  series of conversations between the Greek king Menander and the Buddhist
  teacher N&#x101;gasena. It is precisely this question of the "soul" that
  the unknown author takes up first, describing how N&#x101;gasena
  convinces the king that there is no such thing as the <!-- Page 744
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page744"></a>[v.04 p.0744]</span>"soul"
  in the ordinary sense, and he returns to the subject again and again.<a
  name="FnAnchor_3010" href="#Footnote_3010"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>After Right Views come Right Aspirations. It is evil desires, low
  ideals, useless cravings, idle excitements, that are to be suppressed by
  the cultivation of the opposite&mdash;of right desires, lofty
  aspirations. In one of the Dialogues<a name="FnAnchor_3011"
  href="#Footnote_3011"><sup>[11]</sup></a> instances are given&mdash;the
  desire for emancipation from sensuality, aspirations towards the
  attainment of love to others, the wish not to injure any living thing,
  the desire for the eradication of wrong and for the promotion of right
  dispositions in one's own heart, and so on. This portion of the Path is
  indeed quite simple, and would require no commentary were it not for the
  still constantly repeated blunder that Buddhism teaches the suppression
  of all desire.</p>

  <p>Of the remaining stages of the Path it is only necessary to mention
  two. The one is Right Effort. A constant intellectual alertness is
  required. This is not only insisted upon elsewhere in countless passages,
  but of the three cardinal sins in Buddhism (<i>r&#x101;ga</i>,
  <i>dosa</i>, <i>moha</i>) the last and worst is stupidity or dullness,
  the others being sensuality and ill-will. Right Effort is closely
  connected with the seventh stage, Right Mindfulness. Two of the dialogues
  are devoted to this subject, and it is constantly referred to
  elsewhere.<a name="FnAnchor_3012"
  href="#Footnote_3012"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The disciple, whatsoever he
  does&mdash;whether going forth or coming back, standing or walking,
  speaking or silent, eating or drinking&mdash;is to keep clearly in mind
  all that it means, the temporary character of the act, its ethical
  significance, and above all that behind the act there is no actor (goer,
  seer, eater, speaker) that is an eternally persistent unity. It is the
  Buddhist analogue to the Christian precept: "Whether therefore ye eat or
  drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</p>

  <p>Under the head of Right Conduct the two most important points are Love
  and Joy. Love is in P&#x101;li <i>Mett&#x101;</i>, and the <i>Metta
  Sutta</i><a name="FnAnchor_3013"
  href="#Footnote_3013"><sup>[13]</sup></a> says (no doubt with reference
  to the Right Mindfulness just described): "As a mother, even at the risk
  of her own life, protects her son, her only son, so let him cultivate
  love without measure towards all beings. Let him cultivate towards the
  whole world&mdash;above, below, around&mdash;a heart of love unstinted,
  unmixed with the sense of differing or opposing interests. Let a man
  maintain this mindfulness all the while he is awake, whether he be
  standing, walking, sitting or lying down. This state of heart is the best
  in the world."</p>

  <p>Often elsewhere four such states are described, the Brahma
  Vih&#x101;ras or Sublime Conditions. They are Love, Sorrow at the sorrows
  of others, Joy in the joys of others, and Equanimity as regards one's own
  joys and sorrows.<a name="FnAnchor_3014"
  href="#Footnote_3014"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Each of these feelings was to
  be deliberately practised, beginning with a single object, and gradually
  increasing till the whole world was suffused with the feeling. "Our mind
  shall not waver. No evil speech will we utter. Tender and compassionate
  will we abide, loving in heart, void of malice within. And we will be
  ever suffusing such a one with the rays of our loving thought. And with
  that feeling as a basis we will ever be suffusing the whole wide world
  with thought of love far-reaching, grown great, beyond measure, void of
  anger or ill-will."<a name="FnAnchor_3015"
  href="#Footnote_3015"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The relative importance of love, as compared with other habits, is
  thus described. "All the means that can be used as bases for doing right
  are not worth the sixteenth part of the emancipation of the heart through
  love. That takes all those up into itself, outshining them in radiance
  and glory. Just as whatsoever stars there be, their radiance avails not
  the sixteenth part of the radiance of the moon. That takes all those up
  into itself, outshining them in radiance and glory&mdash;just as in the
  last month of the rains, at harvest time, the sun, mounting up on high
  into the clear and cloudless sky, overwhelms all darkness in the realms
  of space, and shines forth in radiance and glory&mdash;just as in the
  night, when the dawn is breaking, the morning star shines out in radiance
  and glory&mdash;just so all the means that can be used as helps towards
  doing right avail not the sixteenth part of the emancipation of the heart
  through love."<a name="FnAnchor_3016"
  href="#Footnote_3016"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The above is the positive side; the qualities (<i>dhamm&#x101;</i>)
  that have to be acquired. The negative side, the qualities that have to
  be suppressed by the cultivation of the opposite virtues, are the Ten
  Bonds (<i>Samyojanas</i>), the Four Intoxications
  (<i>&#x100;sav&#x101;</i>) and the Five Hindrances
  (<i>N&#x12B;varanas</i>).</p>

  <p>The Ten Bonds are: (1) Delusion about the soul; (2) Doubt; (3)
  Dependence on good works; (4) Sensuality; (5) Hatred, ill-feeling; (6)
  Love of life on earth; (7) Desire for life in heaven; (8) Pride; (9)
  Self-righteousness; (10) Ignorance. The Four Intoxications are the mental
  intoxication arising respectively from (1) Bodily passions, (2) Becoming,
  (3) Delusion, (4) Ignorance. The Five Hindrances are (1) Hankering after
  worldly advantages, (2) The corruption arising out of the wish to injure,
  (3) Torpor of mind, (4) Fretfulness and worry, (5) Wavering of mind.<a
  name="FnAnchor_3017" href="#Footnote_3017"><sup>[17]</sup></a> "When
  these five hindrances have been cut away from within him, he looks upon
  himself as freed from debt, rid of disease, out of jail, a free man and
  secure. And gladness springs up within him on his realizing that, and joy
  arises to him thus gladdened, and so rejoicing all his frame becomes at
  ease, and being thus at ease he is filled with a sense of peace, and in
  that peace his heart is stayed."<a name="FnAnchor_3018"
  href="#Footnote_3018"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To have realized the Truths, and traversed the Path; to have broken
  the Bonds, put an end to the Intoxications, and got rid of the
  Hindrances, is to have attained the ideal, the Fruit, as it is called, of
  Arahatship. One might fill columns with the praises, many of them among
  the most beautiful passages in P&#x101;li poetry and prose, lavished on
  this condition of mind, the state of the man made perfect according to
  the Buddhist faith. Many are the pet names, the poetic epithets bestowed
  upon it&mdash;the harbour of refuge, the cool cave, the island amidst the
  floods, the place of bliss, emancipation, liberation, safety, the
  supreme, the transcendent, the uncreated, the tranquil, the home of
  peace, the calm, the end of suffering, the medicine for all evil, the
  unshaken, the ambrosia, the immaterial, the imperishable, the abiding,
  the farther shore, the unending, the bliss of effort, the supreme joy,
  the ineffable, the detachment, the holy city, and many others. Perhaps
  the most frequent in the Buddhist text is Arahatship, "the state of him
  who is worthy"; and the one exclusively used in Europe is Nirv&#x101;na,
  the "dying out"; that is, the dying out in the heart of the fell fire of
  the three cardinal sins&mdash;sensuality, ill-will and stupidity.<a
  name="FnAnchor_3019" href="#Footnote_3019"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The choice of this term by European writers, a choice made long before
  any of the Buddhist canonical texts had been published or translated, has
  had a most unfortunate result. Those writers did not share, could not be
  expected to share, the exuberant optimism of the early Buddhists.
  Themselves giving up this world as hopeless, and looking for salvation in
  the next, they naturally thought the Buddhists must do the same, and in
  the absence of any authentic scriptures, to correct the mistake, they
  interpreted Nirv&#x101;na, in terms of their own belief, as a state to be
  reached after death. As such they supposed the "dying out" must mean the
  dying out of a "soul"; and endless were the discussions as to whether
  this meant eternal trance, or absolute annihilation, of the "soul." It is
  now thirty years since the right interpretation, founded on the canonical
  texts, has been given, but outside the ranks of P&#x101;li scholars the
  old blunder is still often repeated. It should be added that the belief
  in salvation in this world, in this life, has appealed so strongly to
  Indian sympathies that from the time of the rise of Buddhism down to the
  present day it has been adopted as a part of general Indian belief, and
  <i>J&#x12B;vanmukti</i>, salvation during this life, has become a
  commonplace in the religious language of India.</p>

  <p><i>Adopted Doctrines.</i>&mdash;The above are the essential doctrines
  of <!-- Page 745 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page745"></a>[v.04
  p.0745]</span>the original Buddhism. They are at the same time its
  distinctive doctrines; that is to say, the doctrines that distinguish it
  from all previous teaching in India. But the Buddha, while rejecting the
  sacrifices and the ritualistic magic of the brahmin schools, the
  animistic superstitions of the people, the asceticism and soul-theory of
  the Jains, and the pantheistic speculations of the poets of the
  pre-Buddhistic <i>Upanishads</i>, still retained the belief in
  transmigration. This belief&mdash;the transmigration of the soul, after
  the death of the body, into other bodies, either of men, beasts or
  gods&mdash;is part of the animistic creed so widely found throughout the
  world that it was probably universal. In India it had already, before the
  rise of Buddhism, been raised into an ethical conception by the
  associated doctrine of <i>Karma</i>, according to which a man's social
  position in life and his physical advantages, or the reverse, were the
  result of his actions in a previous birth. The doctrine thus afforded an
  explanation, quite complete to those who believed it, of the apparent
  anomalies and wrongs in the distribution here of happiness or woe. A man,
  for instance, is blind. This is owing to his lust of the eye in a
  previous birth. But he has also unusual powers of hearing. This is
  because he loved, in a previous birth, to listen to the preaching of the
  law. The explanation could always be exact, for it was scarcely more than
  a repetition of the point to be explained. It fits the facts because it
  is derived from them. And it cannot be disproved, for it lies in a sphere
  beyond the reach of human inquiry.</p>

  <p>It was because it thus provided a moral cause that it was retained in
  Buddhism. But as the Buddha did not acknowledge a soul, the link of
  connexion between one life and the next had to be found somewhere else.
  The Buddha found it (as Plato also found it)<a name="FnAnchor_3020"
  href="#Footnote_3020"><sup>[20]</sup></a> in the influence exercised upon
  one life by a desire felt in the previous life. When two thinkers of such
  eminence (probably the two greatest ethical thinkers of antiquity) have
  arrived independently at this strange conclusion, have agreed in
  ascribing to cravings, felt in this life, so great, and to us so
  inconceivable, a power over the future life, we may well hesitate before
  we condemn the idea as intrinsically absurd, and we may take note of the
  important fact that, given similar conditions, similar stages in the
  development of religious belief, men's thoughts, even in spite of the
  most unquestioned individual originality, tend though they may never
  produce exactly the same results, to work in similar ways.</p>

  <p>In India, before Buddhism, conflicting and contradictory views
  prevailed as to the precise mode of action of <i>Karma</i>; and we find
  this confusion reflected in Buddhist theory. The prevailing views are
  tacked on, as it were, to the essential doctrines of Buddhism, without
  being thoroughly assimilated to them, or logically incorporated with
  them. Thus in the story of the good layman Citta, it is an aspiration
  expressed on the deathbed;<a name="FnAnchor_3021"
  href="#Footnote_3021"><sup>[21]</sup></a> in the dialogue on the subject,
  it is a thought dwelt on during life,<a name="FnAnchor_3022"
  href="#Footnote_3022"><sup>[22]</sup></a> in the numerous stories in the
  <i>Peta</i> and <i>Vim&#x101;na Vatthus</i> it is usually some isolated
  act, in the discussions in the <i>Dhamma Sangani</i> it is some mental
  disposition, which is the <i>Karma</i> (doing or action) in the one life
  determining the position of the individual in the next. These are really
  conflicting propositions. They are only alike in the fact that in each
  case a moral cause is given for the position in which the individual
  finds himself now; and the moral cause is his own act.</p>

  <p>In the popular belief, followed also in the brahmin theology, the
  bridge between the two lives was a minute and subtle entity called the
  soul, which left the one body at death, through a hole at the top of the
  head, and entered into the new body. The new body happened to be there,
  ready, with no soul in it. The soul did not make the body. In the
  Buddhist adaptation of this theory no soul, no consciousness, no memory,
  goes over from one body to the other. It is the grasping, the craving,
  still existing at the death of the one body that causes the new set of
  <i>Skandhas</i>, that is, the new body with its mental tendencies and
  capacities, to arise. How this takes place is nowhere explained.</p>

  <p>The Indian theory of <i>Karma</i> has been worked out with many points
  of great beauty and ethical value. And the Buddhist adaptation of it,
  avoiding some of the difficulties common to it and to the allied European
  theories of fate and predestination, tries to explain the weight of the
  universe in its action on the individual, the heavy hand of the
  immeasurable past we cannot escape, the close connexion between all forms
  of life, and the mysteries of inherited character. Incidentally it held
  out the hope, to those who believed in it, of a mode of escape from the
  miseries of transmigration. For as the Arahat had conquered the cravings
  that were supposed to produce the new body, his actions were no longer
  <i>Karma</i>, but only <i>Kiriy&#x101;</i>, that led to no rebirth.<a
  name="FnAnchor_3023" href="#Footnote_3023"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another point of Buddhist teaching adopted from previous belief was
  the practice of ecstatic meditation. In the very earliest times of the
  most remote animism we find the belief that a person, rapt from all sense
  of the outside world, possessed by a spirit, acquired from that state a
  degree of sanctity, was supposed to have a degree of insight, denied to
  ordinary mortals. In India from the soma frenzy in the <i>Vedas</i>,
  through the mystic reveries of the <i>Upanishads</i>, and the hypnotic
  trances of the ancient Yoga, allied beliefs and practices had never lost
  their importance and their charm. It is clear from the <i>Dialogues</i>,
  and other of the most ancient Buddhist records,<a name="FnAnchor_3024"
  href="#Footnote_3024"><sup>[24]</sup></a> that the belief was in full
  force when Buddhism arose, and that the practice was followed by the
  Buddha's teachers. It was quite impossible for him to ignore the
  question; and the practice was admitted as a part of the training of the
  Buddhist Bhikshu. But it was not the highest or the most important part,
  and might be omitted altogether. The states of Rapture are called
  Conditions of Bliss, and they are regarded as useful for the help they
  give towards the removal of the mental obstacles to the attainment of
  Arahatship.<a name="FnAnchor_3025"
  href="#Footnote_3025"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Of the thirty-seven constituent
  parts of Arahatship they enter into one group of four. To seek for
  Arahatship in the practice of the ecstasy alone is considered a deadly
  heresy.<a name="FnAnchor_3026" href="#Footnote_3026"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
  So these practices are both pleasant in themselves, and useful as one of
  the means to the end proposed. But they are not the end, and the end can
  be reached without them. The most ancient form these exercises took is
  recorded in the often recurring paragraphs translated in Rhys Davids'
  <i>Dialogues of the Buddha</i> (i. 84-92). More modern, and much more
  elaborate, forms are given in the <i>Yog&#x101;vacaras Manual of Indian
  Mysticism as practised by Buddhists</i>, edited by Rhys Davids from a
  unique MS. for the P&#x101;li Text Society in 1896. In the Introduction
  to this last work the various phases of the question are discussed at
  length.</p>

  <p><i>Buddhist Texts. The Canonical Books.</i>&mdash;It is necessary to
  remember that the Buddha, like other Indian teachers of his period,
  taught by conversation only. A highly-educated man (according to the
  education current at the time), speaking constantly to men of similar
  education, he followed the literary habit of his day by embodying his
  doctrines in set phrases (<i>s&#x16B;tras</i>), on which he enlarged, on
  different occasions, in different ways. Writing was then widely known.
  But the lack of suitable writing materials made any lengthy books
  impossible. Such s&#x16B;tras were therefore the recognized form of
  preserving and communicating opinion. They were catchwords, as it were,
  <i>memoria technica</i>, which could easily be remembered, and would
  recall the fuller expositions that had been based upon them. Shortly
  after the Buddha's time the Brahmins had their s&#x16B;tras in Sanskrit,
  already a dead language. He purposely put his into the ordinary
  conversational idiom of the day, that is to say, into P&#x101;li. When
  the Buddha died these sayings were collected together by his disciples
  into what they call the Four Nik&#x101;yas, or "collections." These
  cannot have reached their final form till about fifty or sixty years
  afterwards. Other sayings and verses, most of them ascribed, not to the
  Buddha, but to the disciples themselves, were put into a supplementary
  Nik&#x101;ya. We know <!-- Page 746 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page746"></a>[v.04 p.0746]</span>of slight additions made to this
  Nik&#x101;ya as late as the time of Asoka, 3rd century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> And the developed doctrine, found in certain
  portions of it, shows that these are later than the four old
  Nik&#x101;yas. For a generation or two the books so put together were
  handed down by memory, though probably written memoranda were also used.
  And they were doubtless accompanied from the first, as they were being
  taught, by a running commentary. About one hundred years after the
  Buddha's death there was a schism in the community. Each of the two
  schools kept an arrangement of the canon&mdash;still in P&#x101;li, or
  some allied dialect. Sanskrit was not used for any Buddhist works till
  long afterwards, and never used at all, so far as is known, for the
  canonical books. Each of these two schools broke up in the following
  centuries, into others. Several of them had their different arrangements
  of the canonical books, differing also in minor details. These books
  remained the only authorities for about five centuries, but they all,
  except only our extant P&#x101;li Nik&#x101;yas, have been lost in India.
  These then are our authorities for the earliest period of Buddhism. Now
  what are these books?</p>

  <p>We talk necessarily of P&#x101;li <i>books</i>. They are not books in
  the modern sense. They are memorial sentences or verses intended to be
  learnt by heart. And the whole style and method of arrangement is
  entirely subordinated to this primary necessity. Each s&#x16B;tra
  (P&#x101;li, <i>sutta</i>) is very short; usually occupying only a page,
  or perhaps two, and containing a single proposition. When several of
  these, almost always those that contain propositions of a similar kind,
  are collected together in the framework of one dialogue, it is called a
  <i>sullanta</i>. The usual length of such a suttanta is about a dozen
  pages; only a few of them are longer, and a collection of such suttantas
  might be called a book. But it is as yet neither narrative nor essay. It
  is at most a string of passages, drawn up in similar form to assist the
  memory, and intended, not to be read, but to be learnt by heart. The
  first of the four Nik&#x101;yas is a collection of the longest of these
  suttantas, and it is called accordingly the <i>D&#x12B;gha
  Nik&#x101;ya</i>, that is "the Collection of Long Ones" (<i>sci.</i>
  Suttantas). The next is the <i>Majjhima Nik&#x101;ya</i>, the "Collection
  of the suttantas of Medium Length"&mdash;medium, that is, as being
  shorter than the suttantas in the D&#x12B;gha, and longer than the
  ordinary suttas preserved in the two following collections. Between them
  these first two collections contain 186 dialogues, in which the Buddha,
  or in a few cases one of his leading disciples, is represented as engaged
  in conversation on some one of the religious, or philosophic, or ethical
  points in that system which we now call Buddhism. In depth of philosophic
  insight, in the method of Socratic questioning often adopted, in the
  earnest and elevated tone of the whole, in the evidence they afford of
  the most cultured thought of the day, these dialogues constantly remind
  the reader of the dialogues of Plato. But not in style. They have indeed
  a style of their own; always dignified, and occasionally rising into
  eloquence. But for the reasons already given, it is entirely different
  from the style of Western writings which are always intended to be read.
  Historical scholars will, however, revere this collection of dialogues as
  one of the most priceless of the treasures of antiquity still preserved
  to us. It is to it, above all, that we shall always have to go for our
  knowledge of the most ancient Buddhism. Of the 186, 175 had by 1907 been
  edited for the P&#x101;li Text Society, and the remainder were either in
  the press or in preparation.</p>

  <p>A disadvantage of the arrangement in dialogues, more especially as
  they follow one another according to length and not according to subject,
  is that it is not easy to find the statement of doctrine on any
  particular point which is interesting one at the moment. It is very
  likely just this consideration which led to the compilation of the two
  following Nik&#x101;yas. In the first of these, called the <i>Anguttara
  Nik&#x101;ya</i>, all those points of Buddhist doctrine capable of
  expression in classes are set out in order. This practically includes
  most of the psychology and ethics of Buddhism. For it is a distinguishing
  mark of the dialogues themselves that the results arrived at are arranged
  in carefully systematized groups. We are familiar enough in the West with
  similar classifications, summed up in such expressions as the Seven
  Deadly Sins, the Ten Commandments, the Thirty-nine Articles, the Four
  Cardinal Virtues, the Seven Sacraments and a host of others. These
  numbered lists (it is true) are going out of fashion. The aid which they
  afford to memory is no longer required in an age in which books of
  reference abound. It was precisely as a help to memory that they were
  found so useful in the early Buddhist times, when the books were all
  learnt by heart, and had never as yet been written. And in the Anguttara
  we find set out in order first of all the units, then all the pairs, then
  all the trios, and so on. It is the longest book in the Buddhist Bible,
  and fills 1840 pages 8vo. The whole of the P&#x101;li text has been
  published by the P&#x101;li Text Society, but only portions have been
  translated into English. The next, and last, of these four collections
  contains again the whole, or nearly the whole, of the Buddhist doctrine;
  but arranged this time in order of subjects. It consists of 55
  <i>Samyuttas</i> or groups. In each of these the suttas on the same
  subject, or in one or two cases the suttas addressed to the same sort of
  people, are grouped together. The whole of it has been published in five
  volumes by the P&#x101;li Text Society. Only a few fragments have been
  translated.</p>

  <p>Many hundreds of the short suttas and verses in these two collections
  are found, word for word, in the dialogues. And there are numerous
  instances of the introductory story stating how, and when, and to whom
  the sutta was enunciated&mdash;a sort of narrative framework in which the
  sutta is set&mdash;recurring also. This is very suggestive as to the way
  in which the earliest Buddhist records were gradually built up. The
  suttas came first embodying, in set phrases, the doctrine that had to be
  handed down. Those episodes, found in two or three different places, and
  always embodying several suttas, came next. Then several of these were
  woven together to form a suttanta. And finally the suttantas were grouped
  together into the two Nik&#x101;yas, and the suttas and episodes
  separately into the two others. Parallel with this evolution, so to say,
  of the suttas, the short statements of doctrine, in prose, ran the
  treatment of the verses. There was a great love of poetry in the
  communities in which Buddhism arose. Verses were helpful to the memory.
  And they were adopted not only for this reason. The adherents of the new
  view of life found pleasure in putting into appropriate verse the
  feelings of enthusiasm and of ecstasy which the reforming doctrines
  inspired. When particularly happy in literary finish, or peculiarly rich
  in religious feeling, such verses were not lost. These were handed on,
  from mouth to mouth, in the small companies of the brethren or sisters.
  The oldest verses are all lyrics, expressions either of emotion, or of
  some deep saying, some pregnant thought. Very few of them have been
  preserved alone. And even then they are so difficult to understand, so
  much like puzzles, that they were probably accompanied from the first by
  a sort of comment in prose, stating when, and why, and by whom they were
  supposed to have been uttered. As a general rule such a framework in
  prose is actually preserved in the old Buddhist literature. It is only in
  the very latest books included in the canon that the narrative part is
  also regularly in verse, so that a whole work consists of a collection of
  ballads. The last step, that of combining such ballads into one long epic
  poem, was not taken till after the canon was closed. The whole process,
  from the simple anecdote in mixed prose and verse, the so-called
  <i>&#x101;khy&#x101;na</i>, to the complete epic, comes out with striking
  clearness in the history of the Buddhist canon. It is typical, one may
  notice in passing, of the evolution of the epic elsewhere; in Iceland,
  for instance, in Persia and in Greece. And we may safely draw the
  conclusion that if the great Indian epics, the Mah&#x101;-bh&#x101;rata
  and the R&#x101;m&#x101;yana, had been in existence when the formation of
  the Buddhist canon began, the course of its development would have been
  very different from what it was.</p>

  <p>As will easily be understood, the same reasons which led to literary
  activity of this kind, in the earliest period, continued to hold good
  afterwards. A number of such efforts, after the Nik&#x101;yas had been
  closed, were included in a supplementary Nik&#x101;ya called the
  <i>Khuddaka Nik&#x101;ya</i>. It will throw very useful light upon the
  intellectual level in the Buddhist community just <!-- Page 747 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page747"></a>[v.04 p.0747]</span>after the
  earliest period, and upon literary life in the valley of the Ganges in
  the 4th or 5th century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, if we briefly
  explain what the tractates in this collection contain. The first, the
  <i>Khuddaka P&#x101;tha</i>, is a little tract of only a few pages. After
  a profession of faith in the Buddha, the doctrine and the order, there
  follows a paragraph setting out the thirty-four constituents of the human
  body&mdash;bones, blood, nerves and so on&mdash;strangely incongruous
  with what follows. For that is simply a few of the most beautiful poems
  to be found in the Buddhist scriptures. There is no apparent reason,
  except their exquisite versification, why these particular pieces should
  have been here brought together. It is most probable that this tiny
  volume was simply a sort of first lesson book for young neophytes when
  they joined the order. In any case that is one of the uses to which it is
  put at present. The text book is the <i>Dhammapada</i>. Here are brought
  together from ten to twenty stanzas on each of twenty-six selected points
  of Buddhist self-training or ethics. There are altogether 423 verses,
  gathered from various older sources, and strung together without any
  other internal connexion than that they relate more or less to the same
  subject. And the collector has not thought it necessary to choose stanzas
  written in the same metre, or in the same number of lines. We know that
  the early Christians were accustomed to sing hymns, both in their homes
  and on the occasions of their meeting together. These hymns are now
  irretrievably lost. Had some one made a collection of about twenty
  isolated stanzas, chosen from these hymns, on each of about twenty
  subjects&mdash;such as Faith, Hope, Love, the Converted Man, Times of
  Trouble, Quiet Days, the Saviour, the Tree of Life, the Sweet Name, the
  Dove, the King, the Land of Peace, the Joy Unspeakable&mdash;we should
  have a Christian Dhammapada, and very precious such a collection would
  be. The Buddhist Dhammapada has been edited by Professor Fausböll (2nd
  ed., 1900), and has been frequently translated. Where the verses deal
  with those ideas that are common to Christians and Buddhists, the
  versions are easily intelligible, and some of the stanzas appeal very
  strongly to the Western sense of religious beauty. Where the stanzas are
  full of the technical terms of the Buddhist system of self-culture and
  self-control, it is often impossible, without expansions that spoil the
  poetry, or learned notes that distract the attention, to convey the full
  sense of the original. In all these distinctively Buddhist verses the
  existing translations (of which Professor Max Müller's is the best known,
  and Dr Karl Neumann's the best) are inadequate and sometimes quite
  erroneous. The connexion in which they were spoken is often apparent in
  the more ancient books from which these verses have been taken, and has
  been preserved in the commentary on the work itself.</p>

  <p>In the next little work the framework, the whole paraphernalia of the
  ancient akhy&#x101;na, is included in the work itself, which is called
  <i>Ud&#x101;na</i>, or "ecstatic utterances." The Buddha is represented,
  on various occasions during his long career, to have been so much moved
  by some event, or speech, or action, that he gave vent, as it were, to
  his pent-up feelings in a short, ecstatic utterance, couched, for the
  most part, in one or two lines of poetry. These outbursts, very terse and
  enigmatic, are charged with religious emotion, and turn often on some
  subtle point of Arahatship, that is, of the Buddhist ideal of life. The
  original text has been published by the P&#x101;li Text Society. The
  little book, a garland of fifty of these gems, has been translated by
  General Strong. The next work is called the <i>Iti Vuttaka</i>. This
  contains 120 short passages, each of them leading up to a terse deep
  saying of the Buddha's, and introduced, in each case, with the words
  <i>Iti vuttam Bhagaval&#x101;</i>&mdash;"thus was it spoken by the
  Exalted One." These anecdotes may or may not be historically accurate. It
  is quite possible that the memory of the early disciples, highly trained
  as it was, enabled them to preserve a substantially true record of some
  of these speeches, and of the circumstances in which they were uttered.
  Some or all of them may also have been invented. In either case they are
  excellent evidence of the sort of questions on which discussions among
  the earliest Buddhists must have turned. These ecstatic utterances and
  deep sayings are attributed to the Buddha himself, and accompanied by the
  prose framework. There has also been preserved a collection of stanzas
  ascribed to his leading followers. Of these 107 are brethren, and 73
  sisters, in the order. The prose framework is in this case preserved only
  in the commentary, which also gives biographies of the authors. This work
  is called the <i>Thera-ther&#x12B;-g&#x101;th&#x101;</i>.</p>

  <p>Another interesting collection is the <i>J&#x101;taka</i> book, a set
  of verses supposed to have been uttered by the Buddha in some of his
  previous births. These are really 550 of the folk-tales current in India
  when the canon was being formed, the only thing Buddhist about them being
  that the Buddha, in a previous birth, is identified in each case with the
  hero in the little story. Here again the prose is preserved only in the
  commentary. And it is a most fortunate chance that this&mdash;the oldest,
  the most complete, and the most authentic collection of folklore
  extant&mdash;has thus been preserved intact to the present day. Many of
  these stories and fables have wandered to Europe, and are found in
  medieval homilies, poems and story-books. A full account of this curious
  migration will be found in the introduction to the present writer's
  <i>Buddhist Birth Stories</i>. A translation of the whole book is now
  published, under the editorship of Professor Cowell, at the Cambridge
  University Press. The last of these poetical works which it is necessary
  to mention is the <i>Sutta Nip&#x101;ta</i>, containing fifty-five poems,
  all except the last merely short lyrics, many of great beauty. A very
  ancient commentary on the bulk of these poems has been included in the
  canon as a separate work. The poems themselves have been translated by
  Professor Fausböll in the <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>. The above
  works are our authority for the philosophy and ethics of the earliest
  Buddhists. We have also a complete statement of the rules of the order in
  the <i>Vinaya</i>, edited, in five volumes, by Professor Oldenberg. Three
  volumes of translations of these rules, by him and by the present writer,
  have also appeared in the <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>.</p>

  <p>There have also been added to the canonical books seven works on
  <i>Abhidhamma</i>, a more elaborate and more classified exposition of the
  Dhamma or doctrine as set out in the <i>Nik&#x101;yas</i>. All these
  works are later. Only one of them has been translated, the so-called
  Dhamma Sangani. The introduction to this translation, published under the
  title of <i>Buddhist Psychology</i>, contains the fullest account that
  has yet appeared of the psychological conceptions on which Buddhist
  ethics are throughout based. The translator, Mrs Caroline Rhys Davids,
  estimates the date of this ancient manual for Buddhist students as the
  4th century <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p><i>Later Works.</i>&mdash;So far the canon, almost all of which is now
  accessible to readers of P&#x101;li. But a good deal of work is still
  required before the harvest of historical data contained in these texts
  shall have been made acceptable to students of philosophy and sociology.
  These works of the oldest period, the two centuries and a half, between
  the Buddha's time and that of Asoka, were followed by a voluminous
  literature in the following Periods&mdash;from Asoka to Kanishka, and
  from Kanishka to Buddhaghosa,&mdash;each of about three centuries. Many
  of these works are extant in MS.; but only five or six of the more
  important Have so far been published. Of these the most interesting is
  the Milinda, one of the earliest historical novels preserved to us. It is
  mainly religious and philosophical and purports to give the discussion,
  extending over several days, in which a Buddhist elder named
  N&#x101;gasena succeeds in converting Milinda, that is Menander, the
  famous Greek king of Bactria, to Buddhism. The P&#x101;li text has been
  edited and the work translated into English. More important historically,
  though greatly inferior in style and ability, is the Mah&#x101;vastu or
  <i>Sublime Story</i>, in Sanskrit. The story is the one of chief
  importance to the Buddhists&mdash;the story, namely, of how the Buddha
  won, under the Bo Tree, the victory over ignorance, and attained to the
  Sambodhi, "the higher Wisdom," of Nirv&#x101;na. The story begins with
  his previous births, in which also he was accumulating the Buddha
  qualities. And as the Mah&#x101;vastu was a standard work of a particular
  sect, or rather school, called the Mah&#x101;-sanghikas, it has thus
  preserved for us the theory of the Buddha as held outside the followers
  of the cannon, by those whose views developed, in after centuries, into
  the Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na or modern form of Buddhism in India. But this
  book, like all the ancient books, was composed, not in the north, in
  Nepal, but in the valley of the Ganges, and it is partly <!-- Page 748
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page748"></a>[v.04 p.0748]</span>in
  prose, partly in verse. Two other works, the <i>Lalita Vistara</i> and
  the <i>Buddha Carita</i>, give us&mdash;but this, of course, is
  later&mdash;Sanskrit poems, epics, on the same subject. Of these, the
  former may be as old as the Christian era; the latter belongs to the 2nd
  century after Christ. Both of them have been edited and translated. The
  older one contains still a good deal of prose, the gist of it being often
  repeated in the verses. The later one is entirely in verse, and shows off
  the author's mastery of the artificial rules of prosody and poetics,
  according to which a poem, a mah&#x101;-k&#x101;vya, ought, according to
  the later writers on the <i>Ars poetica</i>, to be composed.</p>

  <p>These three works deal only quite briefly and incidentally with any
  point of Buddhism outside of the Buddha legend. Of greater importance for
  the history of Buddhism are two later works, the <i>Netti Pakarana</i>
  and the <i>Saddharma Pundar&#x12B;ka</i>. The former, in P&#x101;li,
  discusses a number of questions then of importance in the Buddhist
  community; and it relies throughout, as does the Milinda, on the
  canonical works, which it quotes largely. The latter, in Sanskrit, is the
  earliest exposition we have of the later Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na doctrine.
  Both these books may be dated in the 2nd or 3rd century of our era. The
  latter has been translated into English. We have now also the text of the
  <i>Prajn&#x101; P&#x101;ramit&#x101;</i>, a later treatise on the
  Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na system, which in time entirely replaced in India the
  original doctrines. To about the same age belongs also the
  <i>Divy&#x101;vad&#x101;na</i>, a collection of legends about the leading
  disciples of the Buddha, and important members of the order, through the
  subsequent three centuries. These legends are, however, of different
  dates, and in spite of the comparatively late period at which it was put
  into its present form, it contains some very ancient fragments.</p>

  <p>The whole of the above works were composed in the north of India; that
  is to say, either north or a few miles south of the Ganges. The record is
  at present full of gaps. But we can even now obtain a full and accurate
  idea of the earliest Buddhism, and are able to trace the main lines of
  its development through the first eight or nine centuries of its career.
  The P&#x101;li Text Society is still publishing two volumes a year; and
  the Russian Academy has inaugurated a series to contain the most
  important of the Sanskrit works still buried in MS. We have also now
  accessible in P&#x101;li fourteen volumes of the commentaries of the
  great 5th-century scholars in south India and Ceylon, most of them the
  works either of Buddhaghosa of Budh Gaya, or of Dhammap&#x101;la of
  K&#x101;ncipura (the ancient name of Conjeeveram). These are full of
  important historical data on the social, as well as the religious, life
  of India during the periods of which they treat.</p>

  <p><i>Modern Research.</i>&mdash;The striking archaeological discoveries
  of recent years have both confirmed and added to our knowledge of the
  earliest period. Pre-eminent among these is the discovery, by Mr William
  Peppé, on the Birdpur estate, adjoining the boundary between English and
  Nepalese territory, of the st&#x16B;pa, or cairn, erected by the
  S&#x101;kiya clan over their share of the ashes from the cremation pyre
  of the Buddha. About 12 m. to the north-east of this spot has been found
  an inscribed pillar, put up by Asoka as a record of his visit to the
  Lumbini Garden, as the place where the future Buddha had been born.
  Although more than two centuries later than the event to which it refers,
  this inscription is good evidence of the site of the garden. There had
  been no interruption of the tradition; and it is probable that the place
  was then still occupied by the descendants of the possessors in the
  Buddha's time. North-west of this another Asoka pillar has been
  discovered, recording his visit to the cairn erected by the Sakyas over
  the remains of Kon&#x101;gamana, one of the previous Puddhas or teachers,
  whose follower Gotama the Buddha had claimed to be. These discoveries
  definitely determine the district occupied by the S&#x101;kiya republic
  in the 6th and 7th centuries <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The
  boundaries, of course, are not known; but the clan must have spread 30 m.
  or more along the lower slopes of the Himalayas and 30 m. or more
  southwards over the plains. It has been abandoned jungle since the 3rd
  century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>, or perhaps earlier, so that the
  ruined sites, numerous through the whole district, have remained
  undisturbed, and further discoveries may be confidently expected.</p>

  <p>The principal points on which this large number of older and better
  authorities has modified our knowledge are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. We have learnt that the division of Buddhism, originating with
  Burnouf, into northern and southern, is misleading. He found that the
  Buddhism in his P&#x101;li MSS., which came from Ceylon, differed from
  that in his Sanskrit MSS., which came from Nepal. Now that the works he
  used have been made accessible in printed editions, we find that,
  wherever the existing MSS. came from, the original works themselves were
  all composed in the same stretch of country, that is, in the valley of
  the Ganges. The difference of the opinions expressed in the MSS. is due,
  not to the place where they are now found, but <i>to the difference of
  time</i> at which they were originally composed. Not one of the books
  mentioned above is either northern or southern. They all claim, and
  rightly claim, to belong, so far as their place of origin is concerned,
  to the Majjhima Desa, the middle country. It is undesirable to base the
  main division of our subject on an adventitious circumstance, and
  especially so when the nomenclature thus introduced (it is not found in
  the books themselves) cuts right across the true line of division. The
  use of the terms northern and southern as applied, not to the existing
  MSS., but to the original books, or to the Buddhism they teach, not only
  does not help us, it is the source of serious misunderstanding. It
  inevitably leads careless writers to take for granted that we have,
  historically, two Buddhisms&mdash;one manufactured in Ceylon, the other
  in Nepal. Now this is admittedly wrong. What we have to consider is
  Buddhism varying through slight degrees, as the centuries pass by, in
  almost every book. We may call it one, or we may call it many. What is
  quite certain is that it is not two. And the most useful distinction to
  emphasize is, not the ambiguous and misleading geographical
  one&mdash;derived from the places where the modern copies of the MSS. are
  found; nor even, though that would be better, the linguistic
  one&mdash;but the chronological one. The use, therefore, of the
  inaccurate and misleading terms northern and southern ought no longer to
  be followed in scholarly works on Buddhism.</p>

  <p>2. Our ideas as to the social conditions that prevailed, during the
  Buddha's lifetime, in the eastern valley of the Ganges have been
  modified. The people were divided into clans, many of them governed as
  republics, more or less aristocratic. In a few cases several of such
  republics had formed confederations, and in four cases such
  confederations had already become hereditary monarchies. The right
  historical analogy is not the state of Germany in the middle ages, but
  the state of Greece in the time of Socrates. The S&#x101;kiyas were still
  a republic. They had republics for their neighbours on the east and
  south, but on the western boundary was the kingdom of Kosala, the modern
  Oudh, which they acknowledged as a suzerain power. The Buddha's father
  was not a king. There were r&#x101;jas in the clan, but the word meant at
  most something like consul or archon. All the four real kings were called
  Mah&#x101;-r&#x101;ja. And Suddhodana, the teacher's father, was not even
  r&#x101;ja. One of his cousins, named Bhaddiya, is styled a r&#x101;ja;
  but Suddhodana is spoken of, like other citizens, as Suddhodana the
  S&#x101;kiyan. As the ancient books are very particular on this question
  of titles, this is decisive.</p>

  <p>3. There was no caste&mdash;no caste, that is, in the modern sense of
  the term. We have long known that the connubium was the cause of a long
  and determined struggle between the patricians and the plebeians in Rome.
  Evidence has been yearly accumulating on the existence of restrictions as
  to intermarriage, and as to the right of eating together (commensality)
  among other Aryan tribes, Greeks, Germans, Russians and so on. Even
  without the fact of the existence now of such restrictions among the
  modern successors of the ancient Aryans in India, it would have been
  probable that they also were addicted to similar customs. It is certain
  that the notion of such usages was familiar enough to some at least of
  the tribes that preceded the Aryans in India. Rules of endogamy and
  exogamy; privileges, restricted to certain classes, of eating together,
  are not only Indian or Aryan, but world-wide phenomena. Both the spirit,
  and to a large degree the actual details, of modern Indian caste-usages
  are identical <!-- Page 749 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page749"></a>[v.04 p.0749]</span>with these ancient, and no doubt
  universal, customs. It is in them that we have the key to the origin of
  caste.</p>

  <p>At any moment in the history of a nation such customs seem, to a
  superficial observer, to be fixed and immutable. As a matter of fact they
  are never quite the same in successive centuries, or even generations.
  The numerous and complicated details which we sum up under the
  convenient, but often misleading, single name of caste, are solely
  dependent for their sanction on public opinion. That opinion seems
  stable. But it is always tending to vary as to the degree of importance
  attached to some particular one of the details, as to the size and
  complexity of the particular groups in which each detail ought to be
  observed.</p>

  <p>Owing to the fact that the particular group that in India worked its
  way to the top, based its claims on religious grounds, not on political
  power, nor on wealth, the system has, no doubt, lasted longer in India
  than in Europe. But public opinion still insists, in considerable circles
  even in Europe, on restrictions of a more or less defined kind, both as
  to marriage and as to eating together. And in India the problem still
  remains to trace, in the literature, the gradual growth of the
  system&mdash;the gradual formation of new sections among the people, the
  gradual extension of the institution to the families of people engaged in
  certain trades, belonging to the same group, or sect, or tribe, tracing
  their ancestry, whether rightly or wrongly, to the same source. All these
  factors, and others besides, are real factors. But they are phases of the
  extension and growth, not explanations of the origin of the system.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence to show that at the time of the rise of Buddhism
  there was any substantial difference, as regards the barriers in
  question, between the peoples dwelling in the valley of the Ganges and
  their contemporaries, Greek or Roman, dwelling on the shores of the
  Mediterranean Sea. The point of greatest weight in the establishment of
  the subsequent development, the supremacy in India of the priests, was
  still being hotly debated. All the new evidence tends to show that the
  struggle was being decided rather against than for the Brahmins. What we
  find in the Buddha's time is caste in the making. The great mass of the
  people were distinguished quite roughly into four classes, social strata,
  of which the boundary lines were vague and uncertain. At one end of the
  scale were certain outlying tribes and certain hereditary crafts of a
  dirty or despised kind. At the other end the nobles claimed the
  superiority. But Brahmins by birth (not necessarily sacrificial priests,
  for they followed all sorts of occupations) were trying to oust the
  nobles from the highest grade. They only succeeded, long afterwards, when
  the power of Buddhism had declined.</p>

  <p>4. It had been supposed on the authority of late priestly texts, where
  boasts of persecution are put forth, that the cause of the decline of
  Buddhism in India had been Brahmin persecution. The now accessible older
  authorities, with one doubtful exception,<a name="FnAnchor_3027"
  href="#Footnote_3027"><sup>[27]</sup></a> make no mention of persecution.
  On the other hand, the comparison we are now able to make between the
  canonical books of the older Buddhism and the later texts of the
  following centuries, shows a continual decline from the old standpoint, a
  continual approximation of the Buddhist views to those of the other
  philosophies and religions of India. We can see now that the very event
  which seemed, in the eyes of the world, to be the most striking proof of
  the success of the new movement, the conversion and strenuous support, in
  the 3rd century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, of Asoka, the most
  powerful ruler India had had, only hastened the decline. The adhesion of
  large numbers of nominal converts, more especially from the newly
  incorporated and less advanced provinces, produced weakness rather than
  strength in the movement for reform. The day of compromise had come.
  Every relaxation of the old thoroughgoing position was welcomed and
  supported by converts only half converted. And so the margin of
  difference between the Buddhists and their opponents gradually faded
  almost entirely away. The soul theory, step by step, gained again the
  upper hand. The popular gods and the popular superstitions are once more
  favoured by Buddhists themselves. The philosophical basis of the old
  ethics is overshadowed by new speculations. And even the old ideal of
  life, the salvation of the Arahat to be won in this world and in this
  world only, by self-culture and self-mastery, is forgotten, or mentioned
  only to be condemned. The end was inevitable. The need of a separate
  organization became less and less apparent. The whole pantheon of the
  Vedic gods, with the ceremonies and the sacrifices associated with them,
  passed indeed away. But the ancient Buddhism, the party of reform, was
  overwhelmed also in its fall; and modern Hinduism arose on the ruins of
  both.</p>

  scholars at work on the subject being directed to the necessary first
  step of publishing the ancient authorities, the work of exploring them,

  <p><b>BUDÉ</b> [<span class="sc">Budaeus</span>], <b>GUILLAUME</b>
  (1467-1540), French scholar, was born at Paris. He went to the university
  of Orleans to study law, but for several years, being possessed of ample
  means, he led an idle and dissipated life. When about twenty-four years
  of age he was seized with a sudden passion for study, and made rapid
  progress, particularly in the Latin and Greek languages. The work which
  gained him greatest reputation was his <i>De Asse et Partibus</i> (1514),
  a treatise on ancient coins and measures. He was held in high esteem by
  Francis I., who was persuaded by him, and by Jean du Bellay, bishop of
  Narbonne, to found the Collegium Trilingue, afterwards the Collège de
  France, and the library at Fontainebleau, which was removed to Paris and
  was the origin of the Bibliothèque Nationale. He also induced Francis to
  refrain from prohibiting printing in France, which had been advised by
  the Sorbonne in 1533. He was sent by Louis XII. to Rome as ambassador to
  Leo X., and in 1522 was appointed <i>maître des requêtes</i> and was
  several times <i>prévôt des marchands</i>. He died in Paris on the 23rd
  of August 1540.</p>

  <p>Budé was also the author of <i>Annotationes in XXIV. libros
  Pandectarum</i> (1508), which, by the application of philology and
  history, had a great influence on the study of Roman law, and of
  <i>Commentarii linguae Graecae</i> (1529), an extensive collection of
  lexicographical notes, which contributed greatly to the study of Greek
  literature in France. Budé corresponded with the most learned men of his
  time, amongst them Erasmus, who called him the marvel of France, and
  Thomas More. He wrote with equal facility in Greek and Latin, although
  his Latin is inferior to his Greek, being somewhat harsh and full of
  Greek constructions. His request that he should be buried at night, and
  his widow's open profession of Protestantism at Geneva (where she retired
  after his death), caused him to be suspected of leanings towards
  Calvinism. At the time of the massacre of St Bartholomew, the members of
  his family were obliged to flee from France. Some took refuge in
  Switzerland, where they worthily upheld the traditions of their house,
  while others settled in Pomerania under the name Budde or Buddeus.</p>

  <p><b>BUDE,</b> a small seaport and watering-place in the Launceston
  parliamentary division of Cornwall, England, on the north coast at the
  mouth of the river Bude. With the market town of Stratton, 1½ m. inland
  to the east, it forms the urban district of Stratton and Bude, with a
  population (1901) of 2308. Bude is served by a branch of the London &amp;
  South-Western railway. Its only notable building is the Early English
  parish church of St Michael and All Angels. The climate is healthy and
  the coast scenery in the neighbourhood fine, especially towards the
  south. There the gigantic cliffs, with their banded strata, have been
  broken into fantastic forms by the waves. Many ships have been wrecked on
  the jagged reefs which fringe their base. The figure-head of one of
  these, the "Bencellon," lost in 1862, is preserved in the churchyard. The
  harbour, sheltered by a breakwater, will admit vessels of 300 tons at
  high water; and the river has been dammed to form a basin for the canal
  which runs to Launceston. Some fishing is carried on: but the staple
  trade is the export of sand, which, being highly charged with carbonate
  of lime, is much used for manure. There are golf links near the town. The
  currents in the bay make bathing dangerous.</p>

  <p><b>BUDGELL, EUSTACE</b> (1686-1737), English man of letters, the son
  of Dr Gilbert Budgell, was born on the 19th of August 1686 at St Thomas,
  near Exeter. He matriculated in 1705 at Trinity College, Oxford, and
  afterwards joined the Inner Temple, London; but instead of studying law
  he devoted his whole attention to literature. Addison, who was first
  cousin to his mother, befriended him, and, on being appointed secretary
  to Lord Wharton, lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1710, took Budgell with
  him as one of the clerks of his office. Budgell took part with Steele and
  Addison in writing the <i>Tatler</i>. He was also a contributor to the
  <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Guardian</i>,&mdash;his papers being marked
  with an X in the former, and with an asterisk in the latter. He was
  subsequently made under-secretary to Addison, chief secretary to the
  lords justices of Ireland, and deputy-clerk of the council, and became a
  member of the Irish parliament. In 1717, when Addison became principal
  secretary of state in England, he procured for Budgell the place of
  accountant and comptroller-general of the revenue in Ireland. But the
  next year, the duke of Bolton being appointed lord-lieutenant, Budgell
  wrote a lampoon against E. Webster, his secretary. This led to his being
  removed from his post of accountant-general, upon which he returned to
  England, and, contrary to the advice of Addison, published his case in a
  pamphlet. In the year 1720 he lost £20,000 by the South Sea scheme, and
  afterwards spent £5000 more in unsuccessful attempts to get into
  parliament. He began to write pamphlets against the ministry, and
  published many papers in the <i>Craftsman</i>. In 1733 he started a
  weekly periodical called the <i>Bee</i>, which he continued for more than
  a hundred numbers. By the will of Matthew Tindal, the deist, who died in
  1733, a legacy of 2000 guineas was left to Budgell; but the bequest
  (which had, it was alleged, been inserted in the will by Budgell himself)
  was successfully disputed by Tindal's nephew and nearest heir, Nicholas
  Tindal, who translated and wrote a <i>Continuation</i> of the <i>History
  of England</i> of Paul de Rapin-Thoyras. Hence Pope's lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Budgell is said to have sold the second volume of Tindal's
  <i>Christianity as Old as the Creation</i> to Bishop Gibson, by whom it
  was destroyed. The scandal caused by these transactions ruined him. On
  the 4th of May 1737, after filling his pockets with stones, he took a
  boat at Somerset-stairs, and while the boat was passing under the bridge
  threw himself into the river. On his desk was found a slip of paper with
  the words&mdash;"What Cato did, and Addison approved, cannot be wrong."
  Besides the works mentioned above, he wrote a translation (1714) of the
  <i>Characters</i> of Theophrastus. He never married, but left a natural
  daughter, Anne Eustace, who became an actress at Drury Lane.</p>

  <p><b>BUDGET</b> (originally from a Gallic word meaning sack, latinized
  as <i>bulga</i>, leather wallet or bag, thence in O. Fr. <i>bougette</i>,
  from which the Eng. form is derived), the name applied to an account of
  the ways and means by which the income and expenditure for a definite
  period are to be balanced, generally by a finance minister for his state,
  or by analogy for smaller bodies.<a name="FnAnchor_321"
  href="#Footnote_321"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The term first came into use in
  England about 1760. In the United Kingdom the chancellor of the
  exchequer, usually in April, lays before the House of Commons a statement
  of the actual results of revenue and expenditure in the past finance year
  (now ending March 31), showing how far his estimates have been realized,
  and what surplus or deficit there has been in the income as compared with
  the expenditure. This is accompanied by another statement in which the
  chancellor gives an estimate of what the produce of the revenue may be in
  the year just entered upon, supposing the taxes and duties to remain as
  they were in the past year, and also an estimate of what the expenditure
  will be in the current year. If the estimated revenue, after allowing for
  normal increase of the principal sources of income, be less than the
  estimated expenditure, this is deemed a case for the imposition of some
  new, or the increase of some existing, tax or taxes. On the other hand,
  if the estimated revenue shows a large surplus over the estimated
  expenditure, there is room for remitting or reducing some tax or taxes,
  and the extent of this relief is generally limited to the amount of
  surplus realized in the previous year. The chancellor of the exchequer
  has to take parliament into confidence on his estimates, both as regards
  revenue and expenditure; and these estimates are prepared by the various
  departments of the administration. They are divided into two parts, the
  consolidated fund services and the supply services, the first comprising
  the civil list, debt charge, pensions and courts of justice, while the
  "supply" includes the remaining expenditure of the country, as the army,
  the navy, the civil service and revenue departments, the post-office and
  telegraph services. The consolidated fund services are an annual charge,
  fixed by statute, and alterable only by statute, but the supply services
  may be gone through in detail, item by item, by the House of Commons,
  which forms itself into a committee of supply for the purpose. These
  items can be criticized, and reduced (but not increased) by amendments
  proposed by private members. The committee of ways and means (also a
  committee of the whole House) votes the supplies when granted and
  originates all taxes. The resolutions of these committees are reported to
  the House, and when the taxation and expenditure obtain the assent of
  parliament, the results as thus adjusted become the final budget estimate
  for the year, and are passed as the Finance Act. This system of annual
  review and adjustment of the public finances obtains not only in the
  British colonies, but in British India. The Indian budget, giving the
  results of income and expenditure in the year ending 31st of December,
  and the prospective estimates, is laid before the imperial parliament in
  the course of the ensuing session.</p>

  <p>The budget, though modified by different forms, has also long been
  practised in France, the United States, and other constitutional
  countries, and has in some cases been adopted by autocratic Powers.
  Russia began the publication of annual budgets in 1866; Egypt has
  followed the example; so also has Turkey, by an imperial decree of 1875.
  All countries agree in taking a yearly period, but the actual date of
  commencement varies considerably. The German and Danish financial year,
  like that of the United Kingdom, begins on the 1st of April; in France,
  Belgium and Austria, it begins on the 1st of January; in Italy, Spain,
  the United States and Canada, on the 1st of July. <!-- Page 751 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page751"></a>[v.04 p.0751]</span>Previously to
  1832, however, the English financial year ran from the 1st of January to
  the 31st of December.</p>

  <p>It may be mentioned that Disraeli introduced a budget (on which he was
  defeated) in the autumn of 1852; and in 1860, owing to the ratification
  of the commercial treaty with France, the budget was introduced on the
  10th of February. In 1859, through a change of administration, the budget
  was not introduced until the 18th of July, while in 1880 there were two
  budgets, one introduced in March under Disraeli's administration, and the
  other in June, under Gladstone's administration.</p>

  <p>National budgets are to be discriminated (1) as budgets passing under
  parliamentary scrutiny and debate from year to year, and (2) budgets
  emitted on executive authority. In most constitutional countries the
  procedure is somewhat of a mean between the extremes of the United
  Kingdom and the United States. In the United Kingdom the budget is placed
  by the executive before the whole House, without any previous examination
  except by the cabinet, and it is scrutinized by the House sitting as a
  committee; in the majority of countries, however, the budget undergoes a
  preliminary examination by a specially selected committee, which has the
  power to make drastic changes in the proposals of the executive. In the
  United States, on the other hand, the budget practically emanates from
  Congress, for there is no connexion between the executive and the
  legislative departments. The estimates prepared by the various executive
  departments are submitted to the House of Representatives by the
  secretary of the treasury. With these estimates two separate committees
  deal. The committee on ways and means deals with taxation, and the
  committee on appropriations with expenditure. The latter committee is
  divided into various sub-committees, each of which brings in an
  appropriation bill for the department or subject with which it is
  charged.</p>

  <p>There are also, in all the greater countries, local and municipal
  taxations and expenditures of only less account than the national. In
  federal governments such as the United States, the German empire, or the
  Argentine republic, the budgets of the several states of the federation
  have to be consulted, as well as the federal budgets, for a knowledge of
  the finances.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;Stourm, <i>Le Budget, son
  histoire et son mécanisme</i> (1889), which gives a comparative study of
  the budgets of different countries, is the best book upon the subject.
  See also Siedler, <i>Budget und Budgetrecht</i>(1885); Sendel, <i>Über
  Budgetrecht</i>(1890); Besson, <i>Le Contrôle des budgets en France et à
  l'étranger</i> (1899); Bastable, <i>Public Finance</i> (3rd ed., 1903);

  <p><a name="Footnote_321" href="#FnAnchor_321">[1]</a> It was a name
  applied also to a leather-covered case or small coffer. Cotgrave
  translates <i>bougette</i> "a little coffer or trunk ... covered with
  leather." It became a common word for a despatch box in which official
  papers were kept. The chancellor of the exchequer thus was said to "open
  his budget" when he made his annual statement.</p>

  <p><b>BUDINI,</b> an ancient nation in the N.E. of the Scythia
  (<i>q.v.</i>) of Herodotus (iv, 21, 108, 109), probably on the middle
  course of the Volga about Samara. They are described as light-eyed and
  red-haired, and lived by hunting in their thick forests. They were
  probably Finns of the branch now represented by the Votiaks and Permiaks,
  forced northwards by later immigrants. In their country was a wooden city
  inhabited by a distinct race, the Geloni, who seem to have spoken an
  Indo-European tongue. Later writers add nothing to our knowledge, and are
  chiefly interested in the tarandus, an animal which dwelt in the woods of
  the Budini and seems to have been the reindeer (Aristotle ap. Aelian,
  <i>Hist. Anim.</i> xv. 33).</p>

  <p>(E. H. M.)</p>

  <p><b>BUDWEIS</b> (Czech <i>Bud&#x11B;jovice</i>), a town of Bohemia,
  Austria, 80 m. S.S.W. of Prague by rail. Pop. (1900) 39,630. It is
  situated at the junction of the Maltsch with the Moldau, which here
  becomes navigable, and possesses a beautiful square, lined with fine
  arcaded buildings, the principal one being the town-hall, built in 1730
  in Renaissance style. Other interesting buildings are the cathedral with
  its detached tower, dating from 1500, and the Marien-Kirche with fine
  cloisters. Budweis has a large, varied and growing industry, which
  comprises the manufacture of chemicals, matches, paper, machinery, bricks
  and tiles, corn and saw mills, boat-building, bell-founding and
  black-lead pencils. It is the principal commercial centre of South
  Bohemia, being an important railway junction, as well as a river port,
  and carries on a large trade in corn, timber, lignite, salt, industrial
  products and beer, the latter mostly exported to America. It is the see
  of a bishop since 1783, and is the centre of a German enclave in Czech
  Bohemia. But the Czech element is steadily increasing, and the population
  of the town was in 1908 60% Czech. The railway from Budweis to Linz, laid
  in 1827 for horse-cars, was the first line constructed in Austria. A
  little to the north, in the Moldau valley, stands the beautiful castle of
  Frauenberg, belonging to Prince Schwarzenberg. It stands on the site
  formerly occupied by a 13th-century castle, and was built in the middle
  of the 19th century, after the model of Windsor Castle.</p>

  <p>The old town of Budweis was founded in the 13th century by Budivoj
  Vitkovec, father of Závi&#x161; of Falkenstein. In 1265 Ottokar II.
  founded the new town, which was soon afterwards created a royal city.
  Charles IV. and his son Wenceslaus granted the town many privileges.
  Although mainly Catholic, Budweis declared for King George
  Pod&#x11B;brad, and in 1468 was taken by the crusaders under Zdenko of
  Stenberg. From this time the town remained faithful to the royal cause,
  and in 1547 was granted by the emperor Ferdinand the privilege of ranking
  at the diet next to Prague and Pilsen. After the outbreak of the Thirty
  Years' War Budweis was confirmed in all its privileges.</p>

  <p><b>BUELL, DON CARLOS</b> (1818-1898), American soldier, was born near
  Marietta, Ohio, on the 23rd of March 1818. He graduated at West Point in
  1841, and as a company officer of infantry took part in the Seminole War
  of 1841-42 and the Mexican War, during which he was present at almost all
  the battles fought by Generals Taylor and Scott, winning the brevet of
  captain at Monterey, and that of major at Contreras-Churubusco, where he
  was wounded. From 1848 to 1861 he performed various staff duties, chiefly
  as assistant-adjutant-general. On the outbreak of the Civil War he was
  appointed lieutenant-colonel on the 11th of May 1861, brigadier-general
  of volunteers a few days later, and major-general of volunteers in March
  1862. He aided efficiently in organizing the Army of the Potomac, and, at
  the instance of General McClellan, was sent, in November 1861, to
  Kentucky to succeed General William T. Sherman in command. Here he
  employed himself in the organization and training of the Army of the Ohio
  (subsequently of the Cumberland), which to the end of its career retained
  a standard of discipline and efficiency only surpassed by that of the
  Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1862 Buell followed the retiring
  Confederates under Sidney Johnston, and appeared on the field of Shiloh
  (<i>q.v.</i>) at the end of the first day's fighting. On the following
  day, aided by Buell's fresh and well-trained army, Grant carried all
  before him. Buell subsequently served under Halleck in the advance on
  Corinth, and in the autumn commanded in the campaign in Kentucky against
  Bragg. After a period of man&oelig;uvring in which Buell scarcely held
  his own, this virtually ended in the indecisive battle of Perryville. The
  alleged tardiness of his pursuit, and his objection to a plan of campaign
  ordered by the Washington authorities, brought about Buell's removal from
  command. With all his gifts as an organizer and disciplinarian, he was
  haughty in his dealings with the civil authorities, and, in high command,
  he showed, on the whole, unnecessary tardiness of movement and an utter
  disregard for the requirements of the political situation. Moreover, as
  McClellan's friend, holding similar views, adverse politically to the
  administration, he suffered by McClellan's displacement. The complaints
  made against him were investigated in 1862-1863, but the result of the
  investigation was not published. Subsequently he was offered military
  employment, which he declined. He resigned his volunteer commission in
  May, and his regular commission in June 1864. He was president of Green
  River ironworks (1865-1870), and subsequently engaged in various mining
  enterprises; he served (1885-1889) as pension agent at Louisville. He
  died near Rockport, Kentucky, on the 19th of November 1898.</p>

  <p><b>BUENAVENTURA,</b> a Pacific port of Colombia, in the department of
  Cauca, about 210 m. W.S.W. of Bogotá. Pop. about 1200. The town is
  situated on a small island, called Cascajal, at the head of a broad
  estuary or bay projecting inland from the Bay of Chocó and 10 m. from its
  mouth. Its geographical position is lat. 3° 48&prime; N., long. 77°
  12&prime; W. The estuary is deep enough for vessels of 24 ft. draught and
  affords an excellent harbour. Buenaventura is a port of call for two
  lines of steamers (English <!-- Page 752 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page752"></a>[v.04 p.0752]</span>and German), and is the Colombian
  landing-place of the West Coast cable. The town is mean in appearance,
  and has a very unhealthy climate, oppressively hot and humid. It is the
  port for the upper basin of the Cauca, an elevated and fertile region,
  with two large commercial centres, Popayan and Cali. In 1907 a railway
  was under construction to the latter, and an extension to Bogotá was also
  projected.</p>

  <p><b>BUENOS AIRES,</b> a maritime province of Argentina, South America,
  bounded N. by the province of Santa Fé and Entre Rios, E. by the latter,
  the La Plata estuary, and the Atlantic, S. by the Atlantic, and W. by the
  territories (<i>gobernaciones</i>) of Rio Negro and Las Pampas, and the
  provinces of Córdoba and Santa Fé. Its area is 117,812 sq. m., making it
  the largest province of the republic. It is also the most populous, even
  excluding the federal district, an official estimate of 1903 giving it a
  population of 1,251,000. Although it has a frontage of over 900 m. on the
  La Plata and the Atlantic, the province has but few good natural ports,
  the best being Bahia Blanca, where the Argentine government has
  constructed a naval port, and Ensenada (La Plata), where extensive
  artificial basins have been constructed for the reception of ocean-going
  steamers. San Nicolas in the extreme north has a fairly good river port,
  while at Buenos Aires a costly artificial port has been constructed.</p>

  <p>In its general aspect the province forms a part of the great treeless
  plain extending from the Atlantic and La Plata estuary westward to the
  Andes. A fringe of small tangled wood covers the low river banks and
  delta region of the Paraná between San Nicolas and Buenos Aires; thence
  southward to Bahia Blanca the sea-shore is low and sandy, with a zone of
  lagoons and partially submerged lands immediately behind. The
  south-eastern and central parts of the province are low and marshy, and
  their effective drainage has long been an urgent problem. Two ranges of
  low mountains extend partly across the southern part of the
  province&mdash;the first from Mar del Plata, on the coast, in a
  north-east direction, known at different points as the Sierra del Volcan
  (885 ft.), Sierra de Tandil (1476 ft.), and Sierra Baya, and the second
  and shorter range nearer Bahia Blanca, having the same general direction,
  known at different points as the Sierra Pillahuinco and Sierra de la
  Ventana (3543 ft.). The country is well watered with numerous lakes and
  small rivers, the largest river being the Rio Salado del Sud, which rises
  near the north-western boundary and flows entirely across the province in
  a south-easterly direction with a course of about 360 m. The Rio Colorado
  crosses the extreme southern extension of the province, a distance of
  about 80 m., but its mouth is obstructed, and its lower course is subject
  to occasional disastrous inundations.</p>

  <p>Cattle-raising naturally became the principal industry of this region
  soon after its settlement by the Spaniards, and sheep-raising on a
  profitable basis was developed about the middle of the 19th century.
  Toward the end of that century the exports of wool, live-stock and
  dressed meats reached enormous proportions. There is a large export of
  jerked beef (<i>tasajo</i>) to Brazil and Cuba, and of live-stock to
  Europe, South Africa and neighbouring South American republics. Much
  attention also has been given to raising horses, asses, mules, swine and
  goats, all of which thrive on these grassy plains. Butter and
  cheese-making have gained considerable prominence in the province since
  1890, and butter has become an article of export. Little attention had
  been given to cereals up to 1875, but subsequently energetic efforts were
  made to increase the production of wheat, Indian corn, linseed, barley,
  oats and alfalfa, so that by the end of the century the exports of wheat
  and flour had reached a considerable value. In 1895 there were 3,400,000
  acres under cultivation in the province, and in 1900 the area devoted to
  wheat alone aggregated 1,960,000 acres. Fruit-growing also has made good
  progress, especially on the islands of the Paraná delta, and Argentine
  peaches, pears, strawberries, grapes and figs are highly appreciated.</p>

  <p>The navigation of the Paraná is at all times difficult, and is
  impossible for the larger ocean-going steamers. The greater part of the
  trade of the northern and western provinces, therefore, must pass through
  the ports of Buenos Aires and Ensenada, at which an immense volume of
  business is concentrated. All the great trunk railways of the republic
  pass through the province and converge at these ports, and from them a
  number of transatlantic steamship lines carry away the products of its
  fertile soil. The province is also liberally supplied with branch
  railways. In the far south the new port of Bahia Blanca has become
  prominent in the export of wool and wheat.</p>

  <p>The principal cities and towns of the province (apart from Buenos
  Aires and its suburbs of Belgrano and Flores) are its capital La Plata;
  Bahia Blanca, San Nicolas, a river port on the Paraná 150 m. by rail
  north-west of Buenos Aires, with a population (1901) of 13,000; Campana
  (pop. 5419 in 1895), the former river port of Buenos Aires on one of the
  channels of the Paraná, 51 m. by rail north-west of that city, and the
  site of the first factory in Argentina (1883) for freezing mutton for
  export; Chivilcoy, an important interior town, with a population (1901)
  of 15,000; Pergamino (9540 in 1895), a northern inland railway centre;
  Mar del Plata, a popular seaside resort 250 m. by rail south of Buenos
  Aires; Azul (9494), Tandil (7088), Chascomús (5667), Mercedes (9269), and
  Barracas al Sud (10,185), once the centre of the jerked beef
  industries.</p>

  <p>The early history of the province of Buenos Aires was a struggle for
  supremacy over the other provinces for a period of two generations. Its
  large extent of territory was secured through successive additions by
  conquest of adjoining Indian territories south and west, the last
  additions being as late as 1879. Buenos Aires became a province of the
  Confederation in 1820, and adopted a constitution in 1854, which provides
  for its administration by a governor and legislature of two chambers,
  both chosen by popular vote. An unsuccessful revolt in 1880 against the
  national government led to the federalization of the city of Buenos
  Aires, and the selection of La Plata as the provincial capital, the
  republic assuming the public indebtedness of the provinces at that time
  as an indemnification. Before the new capital was finished, however, the
  province had incurred further liabilities of ten millions sterling, and
  has since then been greatly handicapped in its development in
  consequence.</p>

  <p>(A. J. L.)</p>

  <p><b>BUENOS AIRES,</b> a city and port of Argentina, and capital of the
  republic, in 34° 36&prime; 21&Prime; S. lat. and 58° 21&prime; 33&Prime;
  W. long., on the west shore of the La Plata estuary, about 155 m. above
  its mouth, and 127 m. W. by N. from Montevideo. The estuary at this point
  is 34 m. wide, and so shallow that vessels can enter the docks only
  through artificial channels kept open by constant dredging. Previously to
  the construction of the new port, ocean-going vessels of over 15 ft.
  draught were compelled to anchor in the outer roads some 12 m. from the
  city, and communication with the shore was effected by means of steam
  tenders and small boats, connecting with long landing piers, or with
  carts driven out from the beach. The city is built upon an open grassy
  plain extending inland from the banks of the estuary, and north from the
  Riachuelo or Matanzas river where the "Boca" port is located. Its average
  elevation is about 65 ft. above sea-level. The federal district, which
  includes the city and its suburbs and covers an area of 72 sq. m., was
  detached from the province of Buenos Aires by an act of congress in 1880.
  With the construction of the new port and reclamation of considerable
  areas of the shallow water frontage, the area of the city has been
  greatly extended below the line of the original estuary banks. The
  streets of the old city, which are narrow and laid out to enclose
  rectangular blocks of uniform size, run nearly parallel with the cardinal
  points of the compass, but this plan is not closely followed in the new
  additions and suburbs. This uniformity in plan, combined with the level
  ground and the style of buildings first erected, gave to the city an
  extremely monotonous and uninteresting appearance, but with its growth in
  wealth and population, greater diversity and better taste in architecture
  have resulted.</p>

  <p>The prevailing style of domestic architecture is that introduced from
  Spain and used throughout all the Spanish colonies&mdash;the grouping of
  one-storey buildings round one or two <i>patios</i>, which open on the
  street through a wide doorway. These residences have heavily barred
  windows on the street, and flat roofs with <!-- Page 753 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page753"></a>[v.04 p.0753]</span>parapets
  admirably adapted for defence. The domiciliation of wealthy foreigners,
  and the introduction of foreign customs and foreign culture, have
  gradually modified the style of architecture, both public and domestic,
  and modern Buenos Aires is adorned with many costly and attractive public
  edifices and residences. French renaissance, lavishly decorated, has
  become the prevailing style. The Avenida Alvear is particularly noted for
  the elegance of its private residences, and the new Avenida de Mayo for
  its display of elaborately ornamented public and business edifices, while
  the suburban districts of Belgrano and Flores are distinguished for the
  attractiveness of their country-houses and gardens. A part of the
  population is greatly overcrowded, one-fifth living in
  <i>conventillos</i>, or tenement-houses.</p>

  <p>Among the city's many <i>plazas</i>, or squares, twelve are especially
  worthy of mention, viz.: 25 de Mayo (formerly Victoria) on which face the
  Government-House and Cathedral, San Martin (or Retiro), Lavalle,
  Libertad, Lorea, Belgrano, 6 de Junio, Once de Setiembre, Independencia
  (formerly Conceptión), Constitución, Caridad and 29 de Deciembre. These
  vary in size from one to three squares, or 4 to 12 acres each, and are
  handsomely laid out with flowers, shrubbery, walks and shade trees. There
  are also two elaborately laid out <i>alamedas</i>, the Recoleta and the
  Paseo de Julio, the latter on the river front and partially absorbed by
  the new port works, and the great park at Palermo, officially called 3 de
  Febrero, which contains 840 acres, beautifully laid out in drives,
  footpaths, lawns, gardens and artificial lakes. In all, the <i>plazas</i>
  and parks of Buenos Aires cover an area of 960 acres.</p>

  <p>The cathedral, which is one of the largest in South America, dating
  from 1752, resembles the Madeleine of Paris in design, and its classical
  portico facing the Plaza 25 de Mayo has twelve stately Corinthian columns
  supporting an elaborately sculptured pediment. The archbishop's palace
  (Buenos Aires became an archiepiscopal see in 1866) adjoins the
  cathedral. There are about twenty-five Roman Catholic churches in the
  city, one of the richest and most popular of which is the Merced on Calle
  Reconquista, and four Protestant churches&mdash;English, Scottish
  Presbyterian, American Methodist and German Lutheran. Twenty asylums for
  orphans and indigent persons and one for lunatics are maintained at
  public expense and by private religious associations, while the demand
  for organized medical and surgical treatment is met by fifteen
  well-appointed hospitals, having an aggregate of 2600 beds, and treating
  17,000 patients annually. Of these, five belong to foreign nationalities.
  The city has six cemeteries covering 230 acres.</p>

  <p>Among the more noteworthy public buildings are the Casa Rosada
  (government-house), facing the Plaza 25 de Mayo and occupying in part the
  site of the fort built by Garay in 1580; the new congress hall on Calle
  Callao and Avenida de Mayo, finished in 1906 at a cost of about
  £1,300,000; the new municipal hall on Avenida de Mayo; the <i>bolsa</i>
  or exchange, distributing reservoir, mint, and some of the more modern
  educational buildings. Higher education is represented by the university
  of Buenos Aires, with its several faculties, including law and medicine,
  and 3562 students (1901), four national colleges, three normal schools
  and various technical schools. There are, also, a national library, a
  national museum, a zoological garden and an aquarium. The people are fond
  of music, the drama and amusements, and devote much time and expense to
  diversions of a widely varied character, from Italian opera to
  horse-racing and <i>pelota</i>. They have two or three large public
  baths, and a large number of social, sporting and athletic clubs. The
  Porteños, as the residents of Buenos Aires are called, are accustomed to
  call their city the "Paris of America," and not without reason. Buenos
  Aires has become the principal manufacturing centre of the republic, and
  its industrial establishments are numbered by thousands and their capital
  by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

  <p>The growth of Buenos Aires since settled conditions have prevailed,
  and especially since its federalization, has been very rapid, and the
  city has finally outstripped all rivals and become the largest city of
  South America. At the time of its first authentic census in 1869, it had
  a population of 177,767. In 1887, when the suburbs of Belgrano and Flores
  with an aggregate population of 28,000 were annexed, its population
  without this increment was estimated at 404,000. In 1895 the national
  census gave the population as 663,854, and in 1904 a municipal census
  increased it to 950,891. At the close of 1905 the national statistical
  office estimated it at 1,025,653. The excess of births over deaths is
  unusually large (about 14 per thousand in 1905). The city has about
  one-fifth of the population of the whole republic. The government is
  vested in an <i>intendente municipal</i> (mayor) appointed by the
  national executive with the approval of the senate, and a <i>concejo
  deliberante</i> (legislative council) elected by the people and composed
  of two councillors from each parish. The police force is a military
  organization under the control of the national executive, and the higher
  municipal courts are subject to the same authority. Every ratepayer,
  whether foreigner or native, has the right to vote in municipal elections
  and to serve in the municipal council.</p>

  <p>The water-supply is drawn from the estuary at Belgrano and conducted
  3½ m. to the Recoleta, where three great settling basins, with an
  aggregate capacity of 12,000,000 gallons, and six acres of covered
  filters, are located. It is then pumped to the great distributing
  reservoir at Calles Córdoba and Viamonte, which covers four acres and has
  a capacity of 13,500,000 gallons. These works were begun in 1873. Up to
  1873, when the water and drainage works were initiated by English
  engineers and contractors, there were no public sewers, and the sanitary
  state of the city was indescribably bad. The cholera epidemic of
  1867-1868, with 15,000 victims, and the yellow fever epidemic of 1871,
  with 26,000 victims, were greatly intensified by these insanitary
  conditions. The construction of the sewers lasted about 19 years, when in
  1892 the water and drainage works were taken over by the government, and
  are now administered at public expense and at a profit. The main sewer is
  16 m. long and extends southward beyond Quilmes. The total cost of the
  two systems exceeded six millions sterling. Buenos Aires is now provided
  with a good water-supply, and its sanitary condition compares favourably
  with that of other great cities, the annual death-rate being about 18 per
  thousand, against 27 per thousand in 1887. Its mean annual temperature is
  64° Fahr., and its annual rainfall 34 in.</p>

  <p>The lighting includes both gas and electricity, the former dating from
  1856. Previously to that time street lighting had been effected at first
  with lamps burning mares' grease, and then with tallow candles. The
  streets were at first paved with cobble-stones, then with dressed granite
  paving-stones (parallelepipedons), and finally with wood and asphalt. The
  tram service is in the hands of nine private companies, operating 313 m.
  of track (31st of December 1905), on almost five-sevenths of which
  electric traction is employed. The city is the principal terminus and
  port for nearly all the trunk railway lines of the republic, which have
  large passenger stations at the Retiro, Once de Setiembre, and
  Constitución plazas, and are connected with the central produce market
  and the new Madero port. The great central produce market at Barracas al
  Sud (<i>Mercado Central de Frutos</i>), whose lands, buildings, railway
  sidings, machinery and mole cost £750,000, is designed to handle the
  pastoral and agricultural products of the country on a large scale, while
  20 markets in the city meet the needs of local consumers.</p>

  <p>The most important feature of the port of Buenos Aires is the "Madero
  docks," constructed to enlarge and improve its shipping facilities.
  Improvements had been, begun in 1872 at the "Boca," as the port on the
  Riachuelo is called, and nearly £1,500,000 was spent there in landing
  facilities and dredging a channel 12 m. in length, to deep water. These
  improvements were found insufficient, and in 1887 work was begun on plans
  executed by Sir John Hawkshaw for a series of four docks and two basins
  in front of the city, occupying 3 m. of reclaimed shore-line, and
  connected with deep water by two dredged channels. The north basin is
  provided with two dry docks, and the new quays are equipped with 24
  warehouses, hydraulic cranes, and 28 m. of railway sidings and
  connexions. The total cost of the new port works <!-- Page 754 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page754"></a>[v.04 p.0754]</span>up to 1908 was
  about £8,000,000 sterling ($40,000,000 gold). In September of that year
  it was decided by congress to borrow £5,000,000 for still further
  extensions which were found to be required. The channels to deep water
  require constant dredging because of the great quantity of silt deposited
  by the river, and on this and allied purposes an expenditure of £560,000
  was voted in 1908. In 1907 there were 29,178 shipping entries in the
  port, with an aggregate of 13,335,737 tons, the merchandise movement
  being 4,360,000 tons imports and 2,900,000 tons of produce exports. The
  revenues for 1907 were $5,452,000 gold, and working expenses, $2,213,000
  gold, the profit ($3,229,000) being equal to about 8% on the cost of
  construction.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Three attempts were made to establish a colony
  where the city of Buenos Aires stands. The first was in 1535 by Don Pedro
  de Mendoza with a large and well-equipped expedition from Spain, which,
  through mismanagement and the hostility of the Indians, resulted in
  complete failure. An expedition sent up the river by Mendoza founded
  Asunción, and thither went the colonists from his "Santa Maria de Buenos
  Ayres" when that settlement was abandoned. The second was in 1542 by a
  part of the expedition from Spain under Cabeza de Vaca, but with as
  little success. The third was in 1580 by Don Juan de Garay, governor of
  Paraguay, who had already established a half-way post at Santa Fé in
  1573, and from this attempt dates the foundation of the city. The need of
  a port near the sea, where supplies from Spain could be received and
  ships provisioned, was keenly felt by the Spanish colonists at Asunción,
  and Garay's expedition down the Paraná in 1580 had that special object in
  view. Garay built a fort and laid out a town in the prescribed Spanish
  style above Mendoza's abandoned settlement, giving it the name of "Ciudad
  de la Santissima Trinidad," but retaining Mendoza's descriptive name for
  the port in appreciation of the agreeable and invigorating atmosphere of
  that locality. Buenos Aires remained a dependency of Asunción until 1620,
  when the Spanish settlements of the La Plata region were divided into
  three provinces, Paraguay, Tucuman and Buenos Aires, and Garay's "city"
  became the capital of the latter and also the seat of a new bishopric.
  The increasing population and trade of the La Plata settlements naturally
  contributed to the importance and prosperity of Buenos Aires, but Spain
  seems to have taken very little interest in the town at that time. Peru
  still dazzled the imagination with her stores of gold and silver, and the
  king and his councillors and merchants had no thought for the little
  trading station on the La Plata, for which one small shipment of supplies
  each year was at first thought sufficient. The proximity of the
  Portuguese settlements of Brazil and the unprotected state of the coast,
  however, made smuggling easy, and the colonists soon learned to supply
  their own needs in that way. The heavy seigniorage tax on gold and
  silver, and the costs of transportation by way of Panama, also sent a
  stream of contraband metal from Charcas to Buenos Aires, where it found
  eager buyers among the Portuguese traders from Brazil, who even founded
  the town of Colonia on the opposite bank of the estuary to facilitate
  their hazardous traffic. In time the magnitude of these operations
  attracted attention at Madrid and efforts were made to suppress them, but
  without complete success until more liberal provisions were made to
  promote trade between Spain and her colonies. In 1776 the Rio de la Plata
  provinces were erected into a vice-royalty, and Buenos Aires became its
  capital. Two years later the old commercial restrictions were abolished
  and a new code was promulgated, so liberal in character compared with the
  old that it was called the "free trade regulations." Under the old system
  all intercourse with foreign countries had been prohibited, with the
  exception of Great Britain and Portugal&mdash;the former having a
  contract (1715 to 1739) to introduce African slaves, and permission to
  send one shipload of merchandise each year to certain colonial ports, and
  the latter's Brazilian colonies having permission to import from Buenos
  Aires each year 2000 fanegas of wheat, 500 quintals of jerked beef and
  500 of tallow. The African slaves introduced into Buenos Aires in this
  way were limited to 800 a year, and were the only slaves of that
  character ever received except some from Brazil after 1778, when greater
  commercial activity in the port created a sudden demand for labourers.
  Under the new regulations 9 ports in Spain and 24 in the colonies were
  declared <i>puertos habilitados</i>, or ports of entry, and trade between
  them was permitted, though under many restrictions. The effect of this
  change may be seen in the exportation of hides to the mother country,
  which had been only 150,000 a year before 1778, but rose to 700,000 and
  800,000 a year after that date. (For the later history of the city see
  <span class="sc">Argentina.</span>)</p>

  <p>(A. J. L.)</p>

  <p><b>BUFF</b> (from Fr. <i>buffle</i>, a buffalo), a leather originally
  made from the skin of the buffalo, now also from the skins of other
  animals, of a dull pale yellow colour, used for making the buffcoat or
  jerkin, a leathern military coat. The old 3rd Foot regiment of the line
  in the British army (now the East Kent Regiment), and the old 78th Foot
  (now 2nd battalion Seaforth Highlanders), are called the "Buffs" and the
  "Ross-shire Buffs" respectively, from the yellow or buff-colour of their
  facings. The term is commonly used now of the colour alone.</p>

  <p><b>BUFFALO,</b> a city and port of entry, and the county-seat of Erie
  county, New York, U.S.A., the second city in population in the state, and
  the eighth in the United States, at the E. extremity of Lake Erie, and at
  the upper end of the Niagara river; distant by rail from New York City
  423 m., from Boston 499 m., and from Chicago 540 m.</p>

  <p>The site of the city, which has an area of 42 sq. m., is a broad,
  undulating tract, rising gradually from the lake to an elevation of from
  50 to 80 ft., its altitude averaging somewhat less than 600 ft. above
  sea-level. The high land and temperate climate, and the excellent
  drainage and water-supply systems, make Buffalo one of the most healthy
  cities in the United States, its death-rate in 1900 being 14.8 per
  thousand, and in 1907 15.58. As originally platted by Joseph Ellicott,
  the plan of Buffalo somewhat resembled that of Washington, but the plan
  was much altered and even then not adhered to. Buffalo to-day has broad
  and spacious streets, most of which are lined by trees, and many small
  parks and squares. The municipal park system is one of unusual beauty,
  consisting of a chain of parks with a total area of about 1030 acres,
  encircling the city and connected by boulevards and driveways. The
  largest is Delaware Park, about 365 acres, including a lake of 46½ acres,
  in the north part of the city; the north part of the park was enclosed in
  the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. Adjoining it is the
  Forest Lawn cemetery, in which are monuments to President Millard
  Fillmore, and to the famous Seneca chief Red Jacket (1751-1830), a friend
  of the whites, who was faithful when approached by Tecumseh and the
  Prophet, and warned the Americans of their danger; by many he has been
  considered the greatest orator of his race. Among the other parks are
  Cazenovia Park, Humboldt Park, South Park on the Lake Shore, and "The
  Front" on a bluff overlooking the source of the Niagara river; in the
  last is Fort Porter (named in honour of Peter B. Porter), where the
  United States government maintains a garrison.</p>

  <p><i>Principal Buildings.</i>&mdash;Buffalo is widely known for the
  beauty of its residential sections, the houses being for the most part
  detached, set well back from the street, and surrounded by attractive
  lawns. Among the principal buildings are the Federal building, erected at
  a cost of $2,000,000; the city and county hall, costing $1,500,000, with
  a clock tower 245 ft. high; the city convention hall, the chamber of
  commerce, the builders' exchange, the Masonic temple, two state
  armouries, the Prudential, Fidelity Trust, White and Mutual Life
  buildings, the Teck, Star and Shea's Park theatres, and the Ellicott
  Square building, one of the largest office structures in the world; and,
  in Delaware Park, the Albright art gallery, and the Buffalo Historical
  Society building, which was originally the New York state building
  erected for the Pan-American Exposition held in 1901. Among the social
  clubs the Buffalo, the University, the Park, the Saturn and the Country
  clubs, and among the hotels the Iroquois, Lafayette, Niagara and Genesee,
  may be especially mentioned. There are many handsome churches, including
  St Joseph's (Roman Catholic) and St Paul's (Protestant Episcopal)
  cathedrals, <!-- Page 755 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page755"></a>[v.04 p.0755]</span>and Trinity (Protestant
  Episcopal), the Westminster Presbyterian, the Delaware Avenue Baptist,
  and the First Presbyterian churches.</p>

  <p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;In addition to the usual high and grammar
  schools, the city itself supports a city training school for teachers,
  and a system of night schools and kindergartens. Here, too, is a state
  normal school. The university of Buffalo (organized in 1845) comprises
  schools of medicine (1845), law (1887), dentistry (1892), and pharmacy
  (1886). Canisius College is a Roman Catholic (Jesuit) institution for men
  (established in 1870 and chartered in 1883), having in 1907 a college
  department and an academic (or high school) department, and a library of
  about 26,000 volumes. Martin Luther Seminary, established in 1854, is a
  theological seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Among the
  best-known schools are the Academy of the Sacred Heart, Buffalo Seminary,
  the Franklin and the Heathcote schools, Holy Angels and St Mary's
  academies, St Joseph's Collegiate Institute, and St Margaret's school for
  girls. The Buffalo public library, founded in 1837, is housed in a fine
  building erected in 1887 (valued at $1,000,000), and contains about
  300,000 books and pamphlets. Other important libraries, with the
  approximate number of their books, are the Grosvenor (founded in 1859),
  for reference (75,000 volumes and 7000 pamphlets); the John C. Lord,
  housed in the building of the Historical Society (10,620); the Law (8th
  judicial district) (17,000); the Catholic Institute (12,000); and the
  library of the Buffalo Historical Society (founded 1862) (26,600), now in
  the handsome building in Delaware Park used as the New York state
  building during the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The Buffalo Society
  of Natural Sciences has a museum in the public library building.</p>

  <p><i>Public Institutions.</i>&mdash;The hospitals and the charitable and
  correctional institutions are numerous and are well administered. Many
  private institutions are richly endowed. Among the hospitals are a state
  hospital for the insane, the Erie county, the Buffalo general, the
  Children's, the United States marine (maintained by the Federal
  government), the German, the Homeopathic, the Women's, the German
  Deaconess and the Riverside hospitals, and the Buffalo hospital of the
  Sisters of Charity. Nurses' training schools are connected with most of
  these. Among the charitable institutions are the Home for the Friendless,
  the Buffalo, St Vincent's and St Joseph's orphan asylums, St John's
  orphan home, St Mary's asylum for widows and foundlings, and the
  Ingleside home for erring women. One of the most noteworthy institutions
  in the city is the Charity Organisation Society, with headquarters in
  Fitch Institute. Founded in 1877, it was the first in the United States,
  and its manifold activities have not only contributed much to the
  amelioration of social conditions in Buffalo, but have caused it to be
  looked to as a model upon which similar institutions have been founded
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The first newspaper, the <i>Gazette</i> (a weekly), was established in
  1811 and became the <i>Commercial</i>, a daily, in 1835. The first daily
  was the <i>Courier</i>, established in 1831. There were in 1908 eleven
  daily papers published, three of which were in German and two in Polish.
  The weekly papers include several in German, three in Polish, and one in
  Italian.</p>

  <p><i>Government and Population.</i>&mdash;Buffalo is governed under an
  amended city charter of 1896 by which the government is vested in a
  bicameral city council, and a mayor elected for a term of four years. The
  mayor appoints the heads of the principal executive departments (health,
  civil service, parks, police and fire). The city clerk is elected by the
  city council. The municipality maintains several well-equipped public
  baths, and owns its water-supply system, the water being obtained from
  Lake Erie. The city is lighted by electricity generated by the water
  power of Niagara Falls, and by manufactured gas. Gas, obtained by pipe
  lines from the Ohio-Pennsylvania and the Canadian (Welland) natural gas
  fields, is also used extensively for lighting and heating purposes.</p>

  <p>From the first census enumeration in 1820 the population has steadily
  and rapidly increased from about 2000 till it reached 352,387 inhabitants
  in 1900, and 423,715 (20% increase) in 1910. In 1900 there were 248,135
  native-born and 104,252 foreign-born; 350,586 were white and only 1801
  coloured, of whom 1698 were negroes. Of the native-born whites, 155,716
  had either one or both parents foreign-born; and of the total population
  93,256 were of unmixed German parentage. Of the foreign-born population
  36,720 were German, the other large elements in their order of importance
  being Polish, Canadian, Irish, the British (other than Irish). Various
  sections of the poorer part of the city are occupied almost exclusively
  by the immigrants from Poland, Hungary and Italy.</p>

  <p><i>Communications and Commerce.</i>&mdash;Situated almost equidistant
  from Chicago, Boston and New York, Buffalo, by reason of its favourable
  location in respect to lake transportation and its position on the
  principal northern trade route between the East and West, has become one
  of the most important commercial and industrial centres in the Union.
  Some fourteen trunk lines have terminals at, or pass through, Buffalo.
  Tracks of a belt line transfer company encircle the city, and altogether
  there are more than 500 m. of track within the limits of Buffalo. Of
  great importance also is the lake commerce. Almost all the great
  steamship transportation lines of the Great Lakes have an eastern
  terminus at Buffalo, which thus has direct passenger and freight
  connexion with Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee and the "Head of
  the Lakes" (Duluth-Superior). With the latter port it is connected by the
  Great Northern Steamship Company, a subsidiary line of the Great Northern
  railway, the passenger service of which is carried on by what are
  probably the largest and finest inland passenger steamships in existence.
  The tonnage of the port of Buffalo is considerably more than 5,000,000
  tons annually. With a water front of approximately 20 m. and with 8 to 10
  m. of wharfs, the shipping facilities have been greatly increased by the
  extensive harbour improvements undertaken by the Federal government.
  These improvements comprise a series of inner breakwaters and piers and
  an outer breakwater of stone and cement, 4 m. in length, constructed at a
  cost of more than $2,000,000. Another artery of trade of great importance
  is the Erie Canal, which here has its western terminus, and whose
  completion (1825) gave the first impetus to Buffalo's commercial growth.
  With the Canadian shore Buffalo is connected by ferry, and by the
  International bridge (from Squaw Island), which cost $1,500,000 and was
  completed in 1873.</p>

  <p>It is as a distributing centre for the manufactured products of the
  East to the West, and for the raw products of the West to the East, and
  for the trans-shipment from lake to rail and vice versa, that Buffalo
  occupies a position of greatest importance. It is one of the principal
  grain and flour markets in the world. Here in 1843 Joseph Dart erected
  the first grain elevator ever constructed. In 1906 the grain elevators
  had a capacity of between twenty and thirty millions of bushels, and
  annual receipts of more than 200,000,000 bushels. The receipts of flour
  approximate 10,000,000 barrels yearly. More than 10,000,000 head of live
  stock are handled in a year in extensive stock-yards (75 acres) at East
  Buffalo; and the horse market is the largest in America. Other important
  articles of commerce are lumber, the receipts of which average
  200,000,000 ft. per annum; fish (15,000,000 lb annually); and iron ore
  and coal, part of which, however, is handled at Tonawanda, really a part
  of the port of Buffalo. Buffalo is the port of entry of Buffalo Creek
  customs district; in 1908 its imports were valued at $6,708,919, and its
  exports at $26,192,563.</p>

  <p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;As a manufacturing centre Buffalo ranks
  next to New York among the cities of the state. The manufactures were
  valued in 1900 at $122,230,061 (of which $105,627,182 was the value of
  the factory product), an increase of 22.2% over 1890; value of factory
  product in 1905, $147,377,873. The value of the principal products in
  1900 was as follows: slaughtering and meat packing, $9,631,187 (in 1905
  slaughtering and meat-packing $12,216,433, and slaughtering, not
  including meat-packing, $3,919,940); foundry and machine shop products,
  $6,816,057 (1905, $11,402,855); linseed oil, $6,271,170; cars and shop
  construction, $4,513,333 (1905, $3,609,471); malt liquors, $4,269,973
  (1905, $5,187,216); soap and candles, $3,818,571 (in 1905, soap <!-- Page
  756 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page756"></a>[v.04
  p.0756]</span>$4,792,915); flour and grist mill products, $3,263,697
  (1905, $9,807,906); lumber and planing mill products, $3,095,760 (1905,
  $4,186,668); clothing, $3,246,723 (1905, $4,231,126); iron and steel
  products, $2,624,547. Other industrial establishments of importance
  include petroleum refineries, ship-yards, brick, stone and lime works,
  saddlery and harness factories, lithographing establishments, patent
  medicine works, chemical works, and copper smelters and refineries. Some
  of the plants are among the largest in existence, notably the Union and
  the Wagner Palace car works, the Union dry docks, the steel plants of the
  Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company, and the Larkin soap factory.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The first white men to visit the site of Buffalo
  were undoubtedly the adventurous French trappers and various Jesuit
  missionaries. Near here, on the east bank of the Niagara river at the
  mouth of Cayuga Creek, La Salle in 1679 built his ship the "Griffin," and
  at the mouth of the river built Fort Conti, which, however, was burned in
  the same year. In 1687 marquis de Denonville built at the mouth of the
  river a fort which was named in his honour and was the predecessor of the
  fortifications on or near the same site successively called Fort Niagara;
  and the neighbourhood was the scene of military operations up to the
  close of the War of Independence. As early as 1784 the present site of
  the city of Buffalo came to be known as "the Buffalo Creek region" either
  from the herds of buffalo or bison which, according to Indian tradition,
  had frequented the salt licks of the creek, or more probably from an
  Indian chief. A little later, possibly in 1788-1789, Cornelius Winney, an
  Indian trader, built a cabin near the mouth of the creek and thus became
  the first permanent white resident. Slowly other settlers gathered. The
  land was a part of the original Phelps-Gorham Purchase, and subsequently
  (about 1793) came into the possession of the Holland Land Company, being
  part of the tract known as the Holland Purchase. Joseph Ellicott, the
  agent of the company, who has been called the "Father of Buffalo," laid
  out a town in 1801-1802, calling it New Amsterdam, and by this name it
  was known on the company's books until about 1810. The name of Buffalo
  Creek or Buffalo, however, proved more popular; the village became the
  county-seat of Niagara county in 1808, and two years later the town of
  Buffalo was erected. Upon the outbreak of the second war with Great
  Britain, Buffalo and the region about Niagara Falls became a centre of
  active military operations; directly across the Niagara river was the
  British Fort Erie. It was from Buffalo that Lieutenant Jesse D. Elliott
  (1782-1845) made his brilliant capture of the "Detroit" and "Caledonia"
  in October 1812; and on the 30th and 31st of December 1813 the settlement
  was attacked, captured, sacked, and almost completely destroyed by a
  force of British, Canadians and Indians under General Sir Phineas Riall
  (<i>c.</i> 1769-1851). After the cessation of hostilities, however,
  Buffalo, which had been incorporated as a village in 1813, was rapidly
  rebuilt. Its advantages as a commercial centre were early recognized, and
  its importance was enhanced on the opening up of the middle West to
  settlement, when Buffalo became the principal gateway for the lake
  routes. Here in 1818 was rebuilt the "Walk-in-the-Water," the first
  steamboat upon the Great Lakes, named in honour of a famous Wyandot
  Indian chief. In 1825 the completion of the Erie Canal with its western
  terminus at Buffalo greatly increased the importance of the place, which
  now rapidly outstripped and soon absorbed Black Rock, a village adjoining
  it on the N., which had at one time threatened to be a dangerous rival.
  In 1832 Buffalo obtained a city charter, and Dr Ebenezer Johnson
  (1786-1849) was chosen the first mayor. In that year, and again in 1834,
  a cholera epidemic caused considerable loss of life. At Buffalo in 1848
  met the Free-Soil convention that nominated Martin van Buren for the
  presidency and Charles Francis Adams for the vice-presidency. Grover
  Cleveland lived in Buffalo from 1855 until 1884, when he was elected
  president, and was mayor of Buffalo in 1882, when he was elected governor
  of New York state. The Pan-American Exposition, in celebration of the
  progress of the Western hemisphere in the nineteenth century, was held
  there (May 1-November 2, 1901). It was during a reception in the Temple
  of Music on the Exposition grounds that President McKinley was
  assassinated (September 6th); he died at the home of John G. Milburn, the
  president of the Exposition. In the house of Ansley Wilcox here
  Vice-President Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office as president. A
  marble shaft 80 ft. high, in memory of McKinley, has been erected in
  Niagara Square.</p>

  <p><b>BUFFALO,</b> a name properly pertaining to an aberrant species of
  cattle which has been kept in a state of domestication in India and Egypt
  from time immemorial, and had been introduced from the latter country
  into southern Europe. It is now taken, however, to include not only this
  species, whose native home is India, but all more or less nearly related
  animals.<a name="FnAnchor_331" href="#Footnote_331"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  Buffaloes are heavily built oxen, with sparsely haired skin, large ears,
  long, tufted tails, broad muzzles and massive angulated horns. In having
  only 13 pairs of ribs they resemble the typical oxen. African buffaloes
  all have the hair of the back directed backwards.</p>

  <p>In the Cape buffalo, <i>Bos (Bubalus) caffer</i>, the horns do not
  attain an excessive length, but in old bulls are so expanded and
  thickened at the base as to form a helmet-like mass protecting the whole
  forehead. Several more or less nearly allied local races have been named;
  and in Eastern Africa the buffaloes (<i>B. caffer aequinoctialis</i>)
  have smaller horns, which do not meet in the middle line. From this
  animal, which is brown instead of black, there seems to be a transition
  towards the red dwarf buffalo (<i>B. nanus</i>) of West Africa, an animal
  scarcely more than two-thirds the size of its gigantic southern cousin,
  with relatively small, much flattened, upwardly curved horns. In South
  Africa buffaloes frequent reedy swamps, where they associate in herds of
  from fifty to a hundred or more individuals. Old bulls may be met with
  either alone or in small parties of from two or three to eight or ten.
  This buffalo formerly roamed in herds over the plains of Central and
  Southern Africa, always in the near vicinity of water, but the numbers
  are greatly diminished. In Cape Colony some herds are protected by the
  government in the eastern forest-districts. This species has never been
  domesticated, nor does there appear to have been any attempt to reduce it
  to service. Like its Indian ally it is fond of water, which it visits at
  regular intervals during the twenty-four hours; it also plasters itself
  with mud, which, when hardened by the sun, protects it from the bite of
  the gadflies which in spite of its thick hide seem to cause it
  considerable annoyance. It is relieved of a portion of the parasitic
  ticks, so common on the hides of thick-skinned animals, by means of the
  red-beaked rhinoceros birds, <i>Buphaga erythrorhynca</i>, a dozen or
  more of which may be seen partly perched on its horns and partly moving
  about on its back, and picking up the ticks on which they feed. The
  hunter is often guided by these birds in his search for the buffalo, but
  oftener still they give timely warning to their host of the dangerous
  proximity of the hunter, and have thus earned the title of "the buffalo's
  guardian birds."</p>

  <p>In a wild state the typical Indian buffalo, <i>Bos (Bubalus)
  bubalis</i>, seems to be restricted to India and Ceylon, although some of
  the buffaloes found in the Malay Peninsula and Islands probably represent
  local races. The species has been introduced into Asia Minor, Egypt,
  Italy and elsewhere. The large size and wide separation of the horns, as
  well as the less thickly fringed ears, and the more elongated and narrow
  head, form marked points of distinction between the Asiatic and South
  African species. Moreover, all Asiatic buffaloes are distinguished from
  the African forms by having the hair on the fore-part of the back
  directed forwards; and these go far to support the views of those who
  would make them the types of a distinct subgenus, <!-- Page 757 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page757"></a>[v.04 p.0757]</span>or genus,
  <i>Buffelus</i>. In Assam there formerly existed a local race, <i>B.
  bubalis macrocercus</i>, characterized by the horns, which are of immense
  size, being directed mainly outwards, instead of curving upwards in a
  circular form. Another Assam race (<i>B. bubalis fulvus</i>) is
  characterized by the tawny, in place of black, colour of its hair and
  hide. The haunts of the Indian buffalo are the grass-jungles near swamps,
  in which the grass exceeds 20 ft. in height. Here the
  buffaloes&mdash;like the Indian rhinoceros&mdash;form covered pathways,
  in which they are completely concealed. The herds frequently include
  fifty or more individuals. These animals are fond of passing the day in
  marshes, where they love to wallow in the mud; they are by no means shy,
  and do much harm to the crops. The rutting-season occurs in autumn, when
  several females follow a single male, forming for the time a small herd.
  The period of gestation lasts for ten months, and the female produces one
  or two calves at a birth. The bull is capable, it is said, of
  overthrowing an elephant, and generally more than a match even for the
  tiger, which usually declines the combat when not impelled by hunger. The
  Indian driver of a herd of tame buffaloes does not shrink from entering a
  tiger-frequented jungle, his cattle, with their massive horns, making
  short work of any tiger that may come in their way. Buffalo fights and
  fights between buffaloes and tigers were recognized Indian sports in the
  old days. Domesticated buffaloes differ from their wild brethren merely
  by their inferior size and smaller horns; some of the latter being of the
  circular and others of the straight type. The milk is good and
  nourishing, but of a ropy consistency and a peculiar flavour.</p>

  <p>The tamarao, or Philippine buffalo, <i>Bos (Bubalus) mindorensis</i>,
  is a smaller animal, in many respects intermediate between the Indian
  buffalo and the dwarf anoa, or Celebes buffalo (<i>B.
  depressicornis</i>).</p>

  <p><b>BUFFET, LOUIS JOSEPH</b> (1818-1898), French statesman, was born at
  Mirecourt. After the revolution of February 1848 he was elected deputy
  for the department of the Vosges, and in the Assembly sat on the right,
  pronouncing for the repression of the insurrection of June 1848 and for
  Louis Napoleon Bonaparte. He was minister of agriculture from August to
  December 1849 and from August to October 1851. Re-elected deputy in 1863,
  he was one of the supporters of the "Liberal Empire" of Emile Ollivier,
  being finance minister in Ollivier's cabinet from January to the 10th of
  April 1870. He was president of the National Assembly from the 4th of
  April 1872 to the 10th of March 1875, and minister of the interior in
  1875. Then, elected senator for life (1876), he pronounced himself in
  favour of the <i>coup d'état</i> of the 16th of May 1877. Buffet had some
  oratorical talent, but shone most in opposition.</p>

  <p><b>BUFFET,</b> a piece of furniture which may be open or closed, or
  partly open and partly closed, for the reception of dishes, china, glass
  and plate. The word may also signify a long counter at which one stands
  to eat and drink, as at a restaurant, or&mdash;which would appear to be
  the original meaning&mdash;the room in which the counter stands. The
  word, like the thing it represents, is French. The buffet is the
  descendant of the credence, and the ancestor of the sideboard, and
  consequently has a close affinity to the dresser. Few articles of
  furniture, while preserving their original purpose, have varied more
  widely in form. In the beginning the buffet was a tiny apartment, or
  recess, little larger than a cupboard, separated from the room which it
  served either by a breast-high balustrade or by pillars. It developed
  into a definite piece of furniture, varying from simplicity to splendour,
  but always provided with one or more flat spaces, or broad shelves, for
  the reception of such necessaries of the dining-room as were not placed
  upon the table. The early buffets were sometimes carved with the utmost
  elaboration; the Renaissance did much to vary their form and refine their
  ornament. Often the lower part contained receptacles as in the
  characteristic English court-cupboard. The rage for collecting china in
  the middle of the 18th century was responsible for a new form&mdash;the
  high glazed back, fitted with shelves, for the display of fine pieces of
  crockery-ware. This, however, was hardly a true buffet, and was the very
  antithesis of the primary arrangement, in which the huge goblets and
  beakers and fantastic pieces of plate, of which so extremely few examples
  are left, were displayed upon the open "gradines." The tiers of shelves,
  with or without a glass front, which are still often found in Georgian
  houses, were sometimes called buffets&mdash;in short, any dining-room
  receptacle for articles that were not immediately wanted came at last to
  bear the name. In France the variations of type were even more numerous
  than in England, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish a commode
  from a buffet. In the latter part of the 18th century the buffet
  occasionally took the form of a console table.</p>

  <p><b>BUFFIER, CLAUDE</b> (1661-1737), French philosopher, historian and
  educationalist, was born in Poland, on the 25th of May 1661, of French
  parents, who returned to France, and settled at Rouen, soon after his
  birth. He was educated at the Jesuit college there, and was received into
  the order at the age of nineteen. A dispute with the archbishop compelled
  him to leave Rouen, and after a short stay in Rome he returned to Paris
  to the college of the Jesuits, where he spent the rest of his life. He
  seems to have been an admirable teacher, with a great power of lucid
  exposition. His object in the <i>Traité des vérités premières</i> (1717),
  his best-known work, is to discover the ultimate principle of knowledge.
  This he finds in the sense we have of our own existence and of what we
  feel within ourselves. He thus takes substantially the same ground as
  Descartes, but he rejected the <i>a priori</i> method. In order to know
  what exists distinct from the self, "common sense" is necessary. Common
  sense he defined as "that disposition which nature has placed in all or
  most men, in order to enable them, when they have arrived at the age and
  use of reason, to form a common and uniform judgment with respect to
  objects different from the internal sentiment of their own perception,
  which judgment is not the consequence of any anterior judgment." The
  truths which this "disposition of nature" obliges us to accept can be
  neither proved nor disproved; they are practically followed even by those
  who reject them speculatively. But Buffier does not claim for these
  truths of "common sense" the absolute certainty which characterizes the
  knowledge we have of our own existence or the logical deductions we make
  from our thoughts; they possess merely the highest probability, and the
  man who rejects them is to be considered a fool, though he is not guilty
  of a contradiction. Buffier's aversion to scholastic refinements has
  given to his writings an appearance of shallowness and want of
  metaphysical insight, and unquestionably he failed entirely even to
  indicate the nature of that universality and necessity which he ascribed
  to his "eternal verities"; he was, however, one of the earliest to
  recognize the psychological as distinguished from the metaphysical side
  of Descartes's principle, and to use it, with no inconsiderable skill, as
  the basis of an analysis of the human mind, similar to that enjoined by
  Locke. In this he has anticipated the spirit and method as well as many
  of the results of Reid and the Scottish school. Voltaire described him as
  "the only Jesuit who has given a reasonable system of philosophy."</p>

  <p>He wrote also <i>Éléments de métaphysique</i> (1724), a "French
  Grammar on a new plan," and a number of historical essays. Most of his
  works appeared in a collected form in 1732, and an English translation of
  the <i>Traité</i> was published in 1780.</p>

  <p><b>BUFFON, GEORGE LOUIS LECLERC,</b> <span class="sc">Comte de</span>
  (1707-1788), French naturalist, was born on the 7th of September 1707, at
  Montbard (Côte d'Or), his father, Benjamin François Leclerc de Buffon
  (1683-1775), being councillor of the Burgundian parlement. He studied law
  at the college of Jesuits at Dijon; but he soon exhibited a marked
  predilection for the study of the physical sciences, and more
  particularly for mathematics. Whilst at Dijon he made the acquaintance of
  a young Englishman, Lord Kingston, and with him travelled through Italy
  and then went to England. He published a French translation of Stephen
  Hales's <i>Vegetable Statics</i> in 1735, and of Sir I. Newton's
  <i>Fluxions</i> in 1740. At twenty-five years of age he succeeded to a
  considerable property, inherited from his mother, and from this time
  onward his life was devoted to regular scientific labour. At first he
  directed his attention more especially to mathematics, physics, <!-- Page

  connected with these subjects. In the spring of 1739 he was elected an
  associate of the Academy of Sciences; and at a later period of the same
  year he was appointed keeper of the Jardin du Roi and of the Royal
  Museum. This appears to have finally determined him to devote himself to
  the biological sciences in particular, and he began to collect materials
  for his <i>Natural History</i>. In the preparation of this voluminous
  work he associated with himself L.J.M. Daubenton, to whom the descriptive
  and anatomical portions of the treaties were entrusted, and the first
  three volumes made their appearance in the year 1749. In 1752 (not in
  1743 or 1760, as sometimes stated) he married Marie Françoise de
  Saint-Belin. He seems to have been fondly attached to her, and felt
  deeply her death at Montbard in 1769. The remainder of Buffon's life as a
  private individual presents nothing of special interest. He belonged to a
  very long-lived race, his father having attained the age of ninety-three,
  and his grandfather eighty-seven. He himself died at Paris on the 15th of
  April 1788, at the age of eighty-one, of vesical calculus, having refused
  to allow any operation for his relief. He left one son, George Louis
  Marie Leclerc Buffon, who was an officer in the French army, and who died
  by the guillotine, at the age of thirty, on the 10th of July 1793 (22
  Messidor, An II.), having espoused the party of the duke of Orleans.</p>

  <p>Buffon was a member of the French Academy (his inaugural address being
  the celebrated <i>Discours sur le style</i>, 1753), perpetual treasurer
  of the Academy of Sciences, fellow of the Royal Society of London, and
  member of the Academies of Berlin, St Petersburg, Dijon, and of most of
  the learned societies then existing in Europe. Of handsome person and
  noble presence, endowed with many of the external gifts of nature, and
  rejoicing in the social advantages of high rank and large possessions, he
  is mainly known by his published scientific writings. Without being a
  profound original investigator, he possessed the art of expressing his
  ideas in a clear and generally attractive form. His chief defects as a
  scientific writer are that he was given to excessive and hasty
  generalization, so that his hypotheses, however seemingly brilliant, are
  often destitute of any sufficient basis in observed facts, whilst his
  literary style is not unfrequently theatrical and turgid, and a great
  want of method and order is commonly observable in his writings.</p>

  <p>His great work is the <i>Histoire naturelle, générale et
  particulière</i>; and it can undoubtedly claim the merit of having been
  the first work to present the previously isolated and apparently
  disconnected facts of natural history in a popular and generally
  intelligible form. The sensation which was made by its appearance in
  successive parts was very great, and it certainly effected much good in
  its time by generally diffusing a taste for the study of nature. For a
  work so vast, however&mdash;aiming, as it did, at being little less than
  a general encyclopaedia of the sciences&mdash;Buffon's capacities may,
  without disparagement, be said to have been insufficient, as is shown by
  the great weakness of parts of the work (such as those relating to
  mineralogy). The <i>Histoire naturelle</i> passed through several
  editions, and was translated into various languages. The edition most
  highly prized by collectors, on account of the beauty of its plates, is
  the first, which was published in Paris (1749-1804) in forty-four quarto
  volumes, the publication extending over more than fifty years. In the
  preparation of the first fifteen volumes of this edition (1749-1767)
  Buffon was assisted by Daubenton, and subsequently by P. Guéneau de
  Montbéliard, the abbé G.L.C.A. Bexon, and C.N.S. Sonnini de Manoncourt.
  The following seven volumes form a supplement to the preceding, and
  appeared in 1774-1789, the famous <i>Époques de la nature</i> (1779)
  being the fifth of them. They were succeeded by nine volumes on the birds
  (1770-1783), and these again by five volumes on minerals (1783-1788). The
  remaining eight volumes, which complete this edition, appeared after
  Buffon's death, and comprise reptiles, fishes and cetaceans. They were
  executed by B.G.E. de Lacépède, and were published in successive volumes
  between 1788 and 1804. A second edition begun in 1774 and completed in
  1804, in thirty-six volumes quarto, is in most respects similar to the
  first, except that the anatomical descriptions are suppressed and the
  supplement recast.</p>

  <p><b>BUG,</b> the name of two rivers of Europe. (1) A stream of European
  Russia, distinguished sometimes as the Southern Bug, which rises in the
  S. of the government of Volhynia, and flows generally S.E. through the
  governments of Podolia and Kherson, and after picking up the Ingul from
  the left at Nikolayev, enters the <i>liman</i> or lagoon into which the
  Dnieper also discharges. Its length is 470 m. Its upper part is beset
  with rapids, and its lower is of little value for navigation on account
  of the numerous sandbanks and blocks of rock which choke its bed. (2) A
  river distinguished as the Western Don, which rises in the E. of Austrian
  Galicia between Tarnopol and Brody, and flows N.N.W. as far as
  Brest-Litovsk, separating the Polish provinces of Lublin and Siedlce from
  the Russian governments of Volhynia and Grodno; it then swings away
  almost due W., between the provinces of Warsaw and Lomza, and joins the
  Vistula, 23 m. below the city of Warsaw. Length, 470 m. It is navigable
  from Brest-Litovsk downwards.</p>

  <p><b>BUG,</b> the common name for hemipterous insects of the family
  <i>Cimicidae</i>, of which the best-known example is the house bug or bed
  bug (<i>Cimex lectularius</i>). This disgusting insect is of an oval
  shape, of a rusty red colour, and, in common with the whole tribe to
  which it belongs, gives off an offensive odour when touched; unlike the
  others, however, it is wingless. The bug is provided with a proboscis,
  which when at rest lies along the inferior side of the thorax, and
  through which it sucks the blood of man, the sole food of this species.
  It is nocturnal in its habits, remaining concealed by day in crevices of
  bed furniture, among the hangings, or behind the wall paper, and shows
  considerable activity in its nightly raids in search of food. The female
  deposits her eggs at the beginning of summer in crevices of wood and
  other retired situations, and in three weeks the young emerge as small,
  white, and almost transparent larvae. These change their skin very
  frequently during growth, and attain full development in about eleven
  weeks. Two centuries ago the bed bug was a rare insect in Britain, and
  probably owes its name, which is derived from a Celtic word signifying
  "ghost" or "goblin," to the terror which its attacks at first inspired.
  An allied species, the dove-cote bug (<i>Cimex columbaria</i>), attacks
  domestic fowls and pigeons.</p>

  <p><b>BUGEAUD DE LA PICONNERIE, THOMAS ROBERT,</b> <span class="sc">duke
  of Isly</span> (1784-1849), marshal of France, was born at Limoges on the
  15th of October 1784. He came of a noble family of Périgord, and was the
  youngest of his parents' thirteen children. Harsh treatment led to his
  flight from home, and for some years about 1800 he lived in the country,
  engaged in agriculture, to which he was ever afterwards devoted. At the
  age of twenty he became a private soldier in the <i>Vélites</i> of the
  Imperial Guard (1804), with which he took part in the Austerlitz campaign
  of the following year. Early in 1806 he was given a commission, and as a
  sub-lieutenant he served in the Jena and Eylau campaigns, winning his
  promotion to the rank of lieutenant at Pultusk (December 1806). In 1808
  he was in the first French corps which entered Spain, and was stationed
  in Madrid during the revolt of the <i>Dos Mayo</i>. At the second siege
  of Saragossa he won further promotion to the rank of captain, and in
  1809-1810 found opportunities for winning distinction under General
  (Marshal) Suchet in the eastern theatre of the Peninsular War, in which
  he rose to the rank of major and the command of a full regiment. At the
  first restoration he was made a colonel, but he rejoined Napoleon during
  the Hundred Days, and under his old chief Suchet distinguished himself
  greatly in the war in the Alps. For fifteen years after the fall of
  Napoleon he was not re-employed, and during this time he displayed great
  activity in agriculture and in the general development of his district of
  Périgord. The July revolution of 1830 reopened his military career, and
  after a short tenure of a regimental command he was in 1831 made a
  <i>maréchal de camp</i>. In the chamber <!-- Page 759 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page759"></a>[v.04 p.0759]</span>of deputies, to
  which he was elected in the same year, he showed himself to be an
  inflexible opponent of democracy, and in his military capacity he was
  noted for his severity in police work and the suppression of
  <i>émeutes</i>. His conduct as gaoler of the duchesse de Berry led to a
  duel between Bugeaud and the deputy Dulong, in which the latter was
  killed (1834); this affair and the incidents of another <i>émeute</i>
  exposed Bugeaud to ceaseless attacks in the Chamber and in the press, but
  his opinion was sought by all parties in matters connected with
  agriculture and industrial development. He was re-elected in 1834, 1837
  and 1839.</p>

  <p>About this time Bugeaud became much interested in the question of
  Algeria. At first he appears to have disapproved of the conquest, but his
  undeviating adherence to Louis Philippe brought him into agreement with
  the government, and with his customary decision he proposed to employ at
  once whatever forces were necessary for the swift, complete and lasting
  subjugation of Algeria. Later events proved the soundness of his views;
  in the meantime Bugeaud was sent to Africa in a subordinate capacity, and
  proceeded without delay to initiate his war of flying columns. He won his
  first victory on the 7th of July 1836, made a brilliant campaign of six
  weeks' duration, and returned home with the rank of lieutenant-general.
  In the following year he signed the treaty of Tafna (June 1st, 1837),
  with Abd-el-Kader, an act which, though justified by the military and
  political situation, led to a renewal of the attacks upon him in the
  chamber, to the refutation of which Bugeaud devoted himself in 1839.
  Finally, in 1840, he was nominated governor-general of Algeria, and early
  in 1841 he put into force his system of flying columns. His swiftness and
  energy drove back the forces of Abd-el-Kader from place to place, while
  the devotion of the rank and file to "Père Bugeaud" enabled him to carry
  all before him in action. In 1842 he secured the French positions by
  undertaking the construction of roads. In 1843 Bugeaud was made marshal
  of France, and in this and the following year he continued his operations
  with unvarying success. His great victory of Isly on the 14th of August
  1844 won for him the title of duke. In 1845, however, he had to take the
  field again in consequence of the disaster of Sidi Brahim (22nd of
  September 1845), and up to his final retirement from Algeria (July 1846)
  he was almost constantly employed in the field. His resignation was due
  to differences with the home government on the question of the future
  government of the province. Amidst his other activities he had found time
  to study the agricultural characteristics of the conquered country, and
  under his régime the number of French colonists had grown from 17,000 to
  100,000. In 1848 the marshal was in Paris during the revolution, but his
  orders prevented him from acting effectually to suppress it. He was
  asked, but eventually refused, to be a candidate for the presidency in
  opposition to Louis Napoleon. His last public service was the command of
  the army of the Alps, formed in 1848-1849 to observe events in Italy. He
  died in Paris on the 10th of June 1849.</p>

  <p>Bugeaud's writings were numerous, including his <i>&OElig;uvres
  militaires</i>, collected by Weil (Paris, 1883), many official reports on
  Algeria and the war there, and some works on economics and political
  science. See Comte d'Ideville, <i>Le Maréchal Bugeaud</i> (Paris,
  1881-1882).</p>

  <p><b>BUGENHAGEN, JOHANN</b> (1485-1558), surnamed <span
  class="sc">Pomeranus</span>, German Protestant reformer, was born at
  Wollin near Stettin on the 24th of June 1485. At the university of
  Greifswald he gained much distinction as a humanist, and in 1504 was
  appointed by the abbot of the Praemonstratensian monastery at Belbuck
  rector of the town school at Treptow. In 1509 he was ordained priest and
  became a vicar in the collegiate <i>Marienkirche</i> at Treptow; in 1517
  he was appointed lecturer on the Bible and Church Fathers at the abbey
  school at Belbuck. In 1520 Luther's <i>De Captivitate Babylonica</i>
  converted him into a zealous supporter of the Reformer's views, to which
  he won over the abbot among others. In 1521 he went to Wittenberg, where
  he formed a close friendship with Luther and Melanchthon, and in 1522 he
  married. He preached and lectured in the university, but his zeal and
  organizing skill soon spread his reforming influence far beyond its
  limits. In 1528 he arranged the church affairs of Brunswick and Hamburg;
  in 1530 those of Lübeck and Pomerania. In 1537 he was invited to Denmark
  by Christian III., and remained five years in that country, organizing
  the church (though only a presbyter, he consecrated the new Danish
  bishops) and schools. He passed the remainder of his life at Wittenberg,
  braving the perils of war and persecution rather than desert the place
  dear to him as the home of the Reformation. He died on the 20th of April
  1558. Among his numerous works is a history of Pomerania, which remained
  unpublished till 1728. Perhaps his best book is the <i>Interpretatio in
  Librum Psalmorum</i> (1523), and he is also remembered as having helped
  Luther in his translation of the Bible.</p>

  <p><b>BUGGE, SOPHUS</b> (1833-1907), Norwegian philologist, was born at
  Laurvik, Norway, on the 5th of January 1833. He was educated at
  Christiania, Copenhagen and Berlin, and in 1866 he became professor of
  comparative philology and Old Norse at Christiania University. In
  addition to collecting Norwegian folk-songs and traditions, and writing
  on Runic inscriptions, he made considerable contributions to the study of
  the Celtic, Romance, Oscan, Umbrian and Etruscan languages. He was the
  author of a very large number of books on philology and folklore. His
  principal work, a critical edition of the elder Edda (<i>Norroen
  Fornkvoedi</i>), was published at Christiania in 1867. He maintained that
  the songs of the <i>Edda</i> and the earlier sagas were largely founded
  on Christian and Latin tradition imported into Scandinavian literature by
  way of England. His writings also include <i>Gamle Norske Folkeviser</i>
  (1858), a collection of Old Norse folk-songs; <i>Bidrag til den aeldste
  skaldedigtnings historie</i> (Christiania, 1894); <i>Helge-digtene i den
  Aeldre Edda</i> (Copenhagen, 1896, Eng. trans., <i>The Home of the Eddic
  Poems</i>, 1899); <i>Norsk Sagafortaelling op Sagaskrivning i Island</i>
  (Christiania, 1901), and various books on Runic inscriptions. He died on
  the 8th of July 1907.</p>

  <p><b>BUGGY,</b> a vehicle with either two (in England and India) or four
  wheels (in America). English buggies are generally hooded and for one
  horse. American buggies are for one horse or two, and either covered with
  a hood or open; among the varieties are the "Goddard" (the name of the
  inventor), the "box," so called from the shape of the body, the "cut
  under," i.e. cut out for the front wheels to cramp beneath and so turn in
  a narrow space, the "end-spring" and "side-bar," names referring to the
  style of hanging. A skeleton buggy, lightly constructed, is used on the
  American "speedways," built and maintained for fast driving. The word is
  of unknown origin; it may be connected with "bogie" (<i>q.v.</i>) a
  truck. The supposed Hindustani <i>bagg&#x12B;</i>, a gig, often given as
  the source, appears to be an invention or an adaptation into the
  vernacular of the English word.</p>

  <p><b>BUGIS,</b> or <span class="sc">Bughis</span>, a people of Malayan
  stock, originally occupying only the kingdom of Boni in the south-western
  peninsula of the island of Celebes. From this district they spread over
  the whole island, and founded settlements throughout the whole Malay
  Archipelago. They are of middle size and robust, of very active,
  enterprising nature and of a complexion slightly lighter than the average
  Malay. In disposition they are brave, haughty and fierce, and are said to
  be more predisposed towards "running amuck" than any other Malayans. They
  speak a language allied to that of the Macassars, and write it with
  similar characters. It has been studied, and its letters reproduced in
  type by Dr B.F. Mathes of the Netherlands Bible Society. The Bugis are
  industrious and ingenious; they practise agriculture more than the
  neighbouring tribes, and manufacture cotton-cloth not only for their own
  use but for export. They also carry on a considerable trade in the
  mineral and vegetable products of Boni, such as gold-dust,
  tortoise-shell, pearls, nut-megs and camphor. Thair love of the sea has
  given them almost a monopoly of trade around Celebes. Their towns <!--
  Page 760 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page760"></a>[v.04
  p.0760]</span>are well built and they have schools of their own. The king
  is elected generally for life, and always from their own number, by the
  chiefs of the eight petty states that compose the confederation of Boni,
  and he cannot decide on any public measure without their consent. In some
  of the states the office of chief is hereditary; in others any member of
  the privileged classes may aspire to the dignity, and it not infrequently
  happens that the state is governed by a woman. The Bugis have been
  Mahommedans since the 17th century. Their original form of nature-worship
  had been much affected by Hindu influences, and even now they retain
  rites connected with the worship of Siva. See further <span

  </div>
  <p><b>BUGLE,</b> <span class="sc">Bugle-horn, Keyed Bugle, Kent Bugle or
  Regent's Bugle</span> (Fr. <i>Bugle</i>, <i>Clairon</i>, <i>Cor à
  clefs</i>, <i>Bugle à clefs</i>; Ger. <i>Flügelhorn</i>,
  <i>Signalhorn</i>, <i>Bugelhorn</i>, <i>Klappenhorn</i>, <i>Kenthorn</i>;
  Ital. <i>Corna cromatica</i>), a treble brass wind instrument with
  cup-shaped mouthpiece and conical bore, used as a military duty and
  signal instrument. The bugle was originally, as its name denotes, a
  bull's horn,<a name="FnAnchor_341"
  href="#Footnote_341"><sup>[1]</sup></a> of which it has preserved the
  characteristic conical bore of rapidly increasing diameter.</p>

  <p>Those members of the brass wind such as the horns, bugle, trumpet and
  tubas, which, in their simplest form, consist of tubes without lateral
  openings, depend for their scale on the harmonic series obtained by
  overblowing, i.e. by greater pressure of breath and by the increased
  tension of the lips, acting as reeds, across the mouthpiece. The harmonic
  series thus produced, which depends on the acoustic principles of the
  tube itself, and is absolutely uninfluenced by the manner in which the
  tube is bent, forms a natural subdivision in classifying these
  instruments:&mdash;(1) Those in which the lower harmonics from the second
  to the sixth or eighth are employed, such as the bugle, post-horn, the
  cornet à pistons, the trombone. (2) Those in which the higher harmonics
  from the third or fourth to the twelfth or sixteenth are mostly used,
  such as the French horn and trumpet. (3) Those which give out the
  fundamental tone and harmonics up to the eighth, such as the tubas and
  ophicleide.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:75%;">

      alt="Harmonic Series." title="Harmonic Series." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>We thus find a fundamental difference between the trumpet and the
  bugle as regards the harmonic series. But although, to the casual
  beholder, these instruments may present a general similarity, there are
  other important structural distinctions. The tube of the trumpet is
  cylindrical, widening only at the bell, whereas that of the bugle, as
  stated above, is conical. Both instruments have cup-shaped mouthpieces
  outwardly similar. The peculiar shape of the basins, however, at the
  place where they open into the tube, angular in the trumpet and bevelled
  in the bugle, taken in conjunction with the bore of the main tube, gives
  to the trumpet its brilliant blaring tone, and to the bugle its more
  veiled but penetrating quality, characteristic of the whole family.<a
  name="FnAnchor_342" href="#Footnote_342"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Only five
  notes are required for the various bugle-calls, although the actual
  compass of the instrument consists of eight, of which the first or
  fundamental, however, being of poor quality, is never used. There are
  bugles in C and in E flat, but the bugle in B flat is most generally
  used; the key of C is used in notation.</p>

  <p>In order to increase the compass and musical possibilities of the
  bugle, two methods have been adopted, the use of (1) keys and (2) valves.
  The application of keys to the bugle produced the Kent bugle, and later
  the ophicleide. The application of valves produced the family of
  saxhorns. The use of keys for wood wind instruments was known early in
  the 15th century,<a name="FnAnchor_343"
  href="#Footnote_343"><sup>[3]</sup></a> perhaps before. In 1438, the duke
  of Burgundy paid Hennequin Haulx, instrument-maker of Brussels, 4
  <i>ridres</i> a piece for three tenor bombards with keys. In the 16th
  century we find a key applied to the bass flûte-à-bec<a
  name="FnAnchor_344" href="#Footnote_344"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and later to
  the large tenor cornetto.<a name="FnAnchor_345"
  href="#Footnote_345"><sup>[5]</sup></a> In 1770 a horn-player named
  Kölbel, belonging to the imperial Russian band, experimented with keys on
  the trumpet, and in 1795 Weidinger of Vienna produced a trumpet with five
  keys. In 1810 Joseph Halliday, the bandmaster of the Cavan militia,
  patented the keyed bugle, with five keys and a compass of twenty-five
  notes, calling it the "Royal Kent Bugle" out of compliment to the duke of
  Kent, who was at the time commander-in-chief, and encouraged the
  introduction of the instrument into the regimental bands. A Royal Kent
  bugle in C, stamped with Halliday's name as inventor, and made by P.
  Turton, 5 Wormwood Gate, Dublin, was exhibited by Col. Shaw-Hellier at
  the Royal Military Exhibition in 1890.<a name="FnAnchor_346"
  href="#Footnote_346"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The instrument measures 17 in.,
  and the total length of the tubing, including the mouthpiece, 50½ in. The
  diameter at the mouthpiece is ½ in. and at the bell 5¾ in. The instrument
  has a chromatic compass of two octaves, <a
  href="images/zbuglemusic2.png"><img src="images/buglemusic2.png"
  class="middle" alt="Chromatic compass." /></a> the open notes being <a
  href="images/zbuglemusic3.png"><img src="images/buglemusic3.png"
  class="middle" alt="Open notes." /></a>.</p>

  <p>Mahillon (op. cit. p. 117) points out that the tonality of the
  key-bugle and kindred instruments is determined by the second harmonic
  given out by the open tube, the first key remaining open. To the original
  instrument specified in the patent, Halliday added a sixth key, which
  became the first and was in the normal position open; this key when
  closed gave B flat, with the same series of harmonics as the open tube.
  The series, however, becomes shorter with each successive key. Thus, on
  being opened, the second key gives <a href="images/zbuglemusic4.png"><img
  src="images/buglemusic4.png" class="middle" alt="Second key." /></a>, the
  third key <a href="images/zbuglemusic5.png"><img
  src="images/buglemusic5.png" class="middle" alt="Third key." /></a>, the
  fourth key <a href="images/zbuglemusic6.png"><img
  src="images/buglemusic6.png" class="middle" alt="Fourth key." /></a>, the
  fifth key <a href="images/zbuglemusic7.png"><img
  src="images/buglemusic7.png" class="middle" alt="Fifth key." /></a>, the
  sixth key <a href="images/zbuglemusic8.png"><img
  src="images/buglemusic8.png" class="middle" alt="Sixth key." /></a>. The
  bore of the instrument is just wide enough in proportion to its length to
  make possible the playing of the fundamental tones in the first two
  series, but these notes are never used, and the harmonics above the sixth
  are also avoided, being of doubtful intonation. In the ophicleide, the
  bass of the key-bugle, the bore is sufficiently wide to produce the
  fundamentals of a satisfactory quality.</p>

  <p>The keyed bugle was chiefly used in B flat, a crook for B flat being
  frequently added to the bugle in C; the soprano bugle in E flat was also
  much used in military bands.</p>

  <p>The origin of the bugle, in common with that of the hunting horn, is
  of the highest antiquity. During the middle ages, the word "bugle" was
  applied to the ox and also to its horns, whether used as musical
  instruments or for drinking. The <i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes a
  definition of bugle dating from c. 1398: "The Bugle ... is lyke to an oxe
  and is a fyers <!-- Page 761 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  href="#Footnote_347"><sup>[7]</sup></a> In 1300 a romance<a
  name="FnAnchor_348" href="#Footnote_348"><sup>[8]</sup></a> contains the
  word used in both acceptations, "A thousand bugles of Ynde," and "tweye
  bugle-hornes and a bowe." F. Godefroy<a name="FnAnchor_349"
  href="#Footnote_349"><sup>[9]</sup></a> gives quotations from early
  French which show that, as in England, the word bugle was frequently used
  as an adjective, and as a verb:&mdash;"IIII cors buglieres fist soner de
  randon" (<i>Quatre fils Aymon</i>, ed. P. Tarbé, p. 32), and "I grant cor
  buglerenc fit en sa tor soner" (<i>Aiol</i>, 7457, <i>Société des anciens
  textes français</i>). Tubas, horns, cornets and bugles have as common
  archetype the horn of ram, bull or other animal, whose form was copied
  and modified in bronze, wood, brass, ivory, silver, &amp;c. Of all these
  instruments, the bugle has in the highest degree retained the acoustic
  properties and the characteristic scale of the prototype, and is still
  put to the original use for giving military signals. The shofar of the
  ancient Hebrews, used at the siege of Jericho, was a cow's horn (Josh.
  vi. 4, 5, 8, 13, &amp;c.), translated in the Vulgate <i>buccina</i>, in
  the paraphrase of the Chaldee <i>buccina ex cornu</i>. The directions
  given for sounding the trumpets of beaten silver described in Numbers x.
  form the earliest code of signals yet known; the narrative shows that the
  Israelites had metal wind instruments; if, therefore, they retained the
  more primitive cow's horn and ram's horn (shofar), it was from choice,
  because they attached special significance to them in connexion with
  their ritual. The trumpet of silver mentioned above was the
  <i>Khatsotsrah</i>, probably the long straight trumpet or tuba which also
  occurs among the instruments in the musical scenes of the ancient
  Egyptians and Assyrians. Gideon's use of a massed band of three hundred
  shofars to terrify and defeat the Midianites (Judges vii. 16), and Saul's
  call to arms (1 Sam. xiii. 3) show that the value of the shofar as a
  military instrument was well understood by the Jews. The cornu was used
  by the Roman infantry to sound the military calls, and Vegetius<a
  name="FnAnchor_3410" href="#Footnote_3410"><sup>[10]</sup></a> states
  that the tuba and buccina were also used for the same purpose. Mahillon
  possesses a facsimile of an ancient Etruscan cornu, the length of which
  is 1.40 m.; he gives its scale,<a name="FnAnchor_3411"
  href="#Footnote_3411"><sup>[11]</sup></a> pitched one tone below that of
  the bugle in E flat, as that of D flat, of which the harmonics <a
  href="images/zbuglemusic9.png"><img src="images/buglemusic9.png"
  class="middle" alt="Scale of Etruscan cornu." /></a>, from the second to
  the sixth are available. The same department of the British Museum was
  enriched in 1904 with a terra-cotta model (fig. 2) of a late Roman bugle
  (<i>c.</i> 4th century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>), bent completely
  round upon itself to form a coil between the mouthpiece and the bell-end
  (the latter has been broken off). This precious relic was found at
  Ventoux in France and has been acquired from the collection of M. Morel.
  This is precisely the form of bugle now used as a badge by the first
  battalion of the King's Own Light Infantry.<a name="FnAnchor_3412"
  href="#Footnote_3412"><sup>[12]</sup></a> During the middle ages the use
  of the bugle-horn by knights and huntsmen, and perhaps also in naval
  warfare, was general in Europe, as the following additional quotations
  will show: "XXX cors bugleres, fait l'amirax soner" (<i>Conq. de
  Jérusalem</i>, 6811, Hippeau); "Two squyers blewe ... with ij grete
  bugles hornes" (Caxton, <i>Chron. Engl. ccix. 192</i>). The oliphant was
  a glorified bugle-horn made of rich material, such as ivory, carved and
  inlaid with designs in gold and silver.</p>

  <p>The history of the bugle as a military instrument is in England
  closely connected with the creation of the light infantry, in which it
  gradually superseded the drum<a name="FnAnchor_3413"
  href="#Footnote_3413"><sup>[13]</sup></a> as a duty and signal
  instrument. It was during the 17th century that the change was
  inaugurated; improvements in firearms brought about the gradual
  abandonment of armour by the infantry, and the formation of the light
  infantry and the adoption of the bugle followed by degrees. One of the
  oldest light infantry regiments, Prince Albert's 1st Somerset Light
  Infantry, formed in 1685 by the earl of Huntingdon, employed a drummer at
  that date at a shilling per day.<a name="FnAnchor_3414"
  href="#Footnote_3414"><sup>[14]</sup></a> At the end of the 18th century
  we find the bugle the recognized signal instrument in the light infantry,
  while the trumpet remained that of the cavalry. The general order
  introducing the bugle as a minor badge for the light infantry is under
  date 28th of December 1814. In 1856 the popularity of the keyed or Royal
  Kent bugle in the army had reached its height. A bugle-band was formed in
  the Royal Artillery as a substitute for the drum and fife band.<a
  name="FnAnchor_3415" href="#Footnote_3415"><sup>[15]</sup></a> The
  organization and training of this bugle-band were entrusted to
  Trumpet-major James Lawson, who raised it to a very high standard of
  excellence. Major Lawson was a fine cornet player, and finding the scale
  of the service bugle too restricted he obtained permission to add to it a
  valve attachment, which made the bugle a chromatic instrument like the
  cornet, in fact practically a saxhorn. Before long, horns in E flat,
  tenor horns in B flat, euphoniums and bass tubas were added, all made of
  copper, and in 1869 the name of "bugle band" was changed to R.A. Brass
  Band, and in 1877 it was merged in the Mounted Band. The bugle with its
  double development by means of keys into Royal Kent bugle and ophicleide,
  and by means of valves into saxhorns and tubas, formed the nucleus of
  brass bands of all countries during the greater part of the 19th century.
  The Flügelhorn, as its name denotes, became the signal instrument of the
  infantry in Germany as in England, and still holds it own with the keyed
  bugle in the fine military bands of Austro-Hungary.</p>

  <p>There is in the department of prehistoric antiquities at the British
  Museum a fine bugle-horn belonging to the Bronze Age in Denmark; the
  tube, which has an accentuated conical bore, is bent in a semi-circle,
  and has on the inner bend a series of little rings from which were
  probably suspended ornaments or cords. An engraved design runs spirally
  round the whole length of the tube, which is in an excellent state of
  preservation.</p>

  <p>Meyerbeer introduced the bugle in B flat in his opera
  <i>Robert-le-Diable</i> in the scene of the resurrection of the nuns, and
  a bugle in A in the fifth act.</p>

  <p>See, for further information on the technique of the instrument,

  Bugle</i> (London, Clementi, 1820); and for the use of the bugle in the

  <p><b>BUGTI,</b> a Baluch tribe of Rind (Arab) origin, numbering about
  15,500, who occupy the hills to the east of the Sind-Peshin railway,
  between Jacobabad and Sibi, with the Marris (a cognate tribe) to the
  north of them. Like the Marris, the Bugtis are physically a magnificent
  race of people, fine horsemen, good swordsmen and hereditary robbers. An
  expedition against them was organized by Sir C. Napier in 1845, but they
  were never brought under control till Sir Robert Sandeman ruled
  Baluchistan. Since the construction of the railway, which completely
  outflanks their country, they have been fairly orderly.</p>

  <p><b>BUHLE, JOHANN GOTTLIEB</b> (1763-1821), German scholar and
  philosopher, was born at Brunswick, and educated at Göttingen. He became
  professor of philosophy at Göttingen, Moscow (1840) and Brunswick. Of his
  numerous publications, <!-- Page 762 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page762"></a>[v.04 p.0762]</span>the most important are the
  <i>Handbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie</i> (8 vols., 1796-1804), and
  <i>Geschichte der neueren Philosophie</i> (6 vols., 1800-1805). The
  latter, elaborate and well written, is lacking in critical appreciation
  and proportion; there are French and Italian translations. He edited
  Aratus (2 vols., 1793, 1801) and part of Aristotle (Bipontine edition,
  vols. i.-v., 1791-1904).</p>

  <p><b>BUHTUR&#x12A;</b> [al-Wal&#x12B;d ibn 'Ubaid All&#x101;h]
  (820-897), Arabian poet, was born at Manbij (Hierapolis) in Syria,
  between Aleppo and the Euphrates. Like Ab&#x16B; Tamm&#x101;m, he was of
  the tribe of T&#x101;i. While still young, he went to visit Ab&#x16B;
  Tamm&#x101;m at Horns, and by him was commended to the authorities at
  Ma'arrat un-Nu'm&#x101;n, who gave him a pension of 4000 dirhems (about
  £90) yearly. Later he went to Bagdad, where he wrote verses in praise of
  the caliph Motawakkil and of the members of his court. Although long
  resident in Bagdad he devoted much of his poetry to the praise of Aleppo,
  and much of his love-poetry is dedicated to Alwa, a maiden of that city.
  He died at Manbij Hierapolis in 897. His poetry was collected and edited
  twice in the 10th century, arranged in one edition alphabetically (i.e.
  according to the last consonant in each line); in the other according to
  subjects. It was published in Constantinople (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1883). Like Ab&#x16B; Tamm&#x101;m he made a
  collection of early poems, known as the Ham&#x101;sa (index of the poems
  contained in it, in the <i>Journal of the German Oriental Society</i>,

  <p><b>BUILDERS' RITES.</b> Many people familiar with the ceremonies
  attendant on the laying of foundation stones, whether ecclesiastical,
  masonic or otherwise, may be at a loss to account for the actual origin
  of the custom in placing within a cavity beneath the stone, a few coins
  of the realm, newspapers, &amp;c. The ordinary view that by such means
  particulars may be found of the event on the removal of the stone
  hereafter, may suffice as respects latter-day motives, but such memorials
  are deposited in the hope that they will never be disturbed, and so
  another reason must be found for such an ancient survival. Whilst old
  customs continue, the reasons for them are ever changing, and certainly
  this fact applies to laying foundation stones. Originally, it appears
  that living victims were selected as "a sacrifice to the gods," and
  especially to ensure the stability of the building. Grimm<a
  name="FnAnchor_351" href="#Footnote_351"><sup>[1]</sup></a> remarks "It
  was often thought necessary to immure live animals and even men in the
  foundation, on which the structure was to be raised, to secure immovable
  stability." There is no lack of evidence as to this gruesome practice,
  both in savage and civilized communities. "The old pagan laid the
  foundation of his house and fortress in blood."<a name="FnAnchor_352"
  href="#Footnote_352"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Under the walls of two round
  towers in Ireland (the only ones examined) human skeletons have been
  discovered. In the 15th century, the wall of Holsworthy church was built
  over a living human being, and when this became unlawful, images of
  living beings were substituted (<i>Folk-Lore Journal</i>, i. 23-24).</p>

  <p>The best succinct account of these rites is to be obtained in G. W.
  Speth's <i>Builders' Rites and Ceremonies</i> (1893).</p>

  <p><b>BUILDING.</b><a name="FnAnchor_361"
  href="#Footnote_361"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The art of building comprises the
  practice of civil architecture, or the mechanical operations necessary to
  <span class="sidenote">Relation of building to architecture.</span> carry
  the designs of the architect into effect. It is not infrequently called
  "practical architecture," but the adoption of this form would lead only
  to confusion, by rendering it difficult to make the distinction generally
  understood between architecture (<i>q.v.</i>) as a fine or liberal art,
  and architecture as a mechanical art. The execution of works of
  architecture necessarily includes building, but building is frequently
  employed when the result is not architectural; a man may be a competent
  builder without being an architect, but no one can be an accomplished
  architect unless he be competent to specify and direct all the operations
  of building. An architect should have a scientific knowledge of the
  various soils he may meet with, such as clay, earth, silt, rock, gravel,
  chalk, &amp;c., so that when the trial holes are dug out on the site, he
  can see the nature of the soil, and at once know what kind of a
  foundation to put to the building, and the depth to which he must go to
  get a good bottom. He should also have a good knowledge of chemistry, so
  that he may understand the effects of the various acids, gases, &amp;c.,
  that are contained in the materials he uses, and the objections to their
  presence. He must be acquainted with the principles of timbering in
  trenches, and excavations, shoring, brickwork, fireproof construction,
  stonework, carpentry and joinery, smiths' work, plumbing, heating,
  ventilation, bells, electric and gas lighting, water-supply, drainage,
  plastering, tiling to internal walls or pavings and roofs, slating of
  roofs, glazing, painting and decoration. He should be able to calculate
  the various strengths and strains to be placed on any portion of the
  structure, and have a general knowledge of the building trade, enabling
  him to deal with any difficulty or defects that may arise.</p>

  <p>An important feature in the qualification of the architect is that he
  should be thoroughly conversant with the by-laws of the different towns
  or districts, as to the requirements for the various classes of
  buildings, and the special features of portions of the different
  buildings. The following are examples of the various buildings which he
  may have to design, and the erection of which he may have to
  superintend:&mdash;dwelling-houses, domestic buildings, shops, dwellings
  for the working class, public buildings such as churches, schools,
  hospitals, libraries and hotels, factories of all kinds for all general
  trades, studios, electric power stations, cold storage buildings, stables
  and slaughterhouses. With regard to factories, places for the storage or
  making of different patent foods, and for slaughter of beasts intended
  for human consumption, stringent by-laws are in most countries laid down
  and enforced by the public health authorities. In England, the Public
  Health Acts and By-laws are carried out by the various borough or
  district authorities, who appoint inspectors especially to study the
  health of the public with regard to sanitary arrangements. The inspectors
  have special powers to deal with all improper or defective food, or with
  any defects in buildings that may affect its cleanly preparation.</p>

  <p>In addition to meeting the requirements of the clients, the various
  buildings have to be constructed and planned on clearly <span
  class="sidenote">Reasons for special type of plans.</span> defined lines,
  according to the rules of the various authorities that control their
  erection; thus the construction and planning of public schools are
  governed in England by the board of education, and churches are governed
  by the various societies that assist in financing the erection of these
  edifices; of these the Incorporated Church Building Society exercises the
  strongest control. Factories both in England and France must be planned
  and erected to meet the separate acts that deal with these buildings. The
  fire insurance companies lay down certain requirements according to the
  size of the building, and the special trade for which it is erected, and
  fix their rate of premium accordingly. Dwelling-houses in London must be
  erected in accordance with the many building acts which govern the
  materials to be used, and the methods by which they shall be employed,
  the thickness of walls, rates of inclination of roofs, means of escape
  from fire, drainage, space at rear, &amp;c. &amp;c.; these laws
  especially forbid the use of timber framed buildings. In sundry districts
  in England where the model by-laws are not in force, notably at
  Letchworth, Herts, it is possible to erect buildings with sound materials
  untrammelled by by-laws. With regard to premises used in a combined way,
  as shop and dwelling-house, if in London, and the building exceeds 10
  squares, or 1000 sq. ft. super in area, the stairs and a large portion of
  the building must be built of fire-resisting materials. In the erection
  of London flats under certain conditions the stairs and corridors <!--
  Page 763 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page763"></a>[v.04
  p.0763]</span>must be of fire-resisting materials, while in parts of New
  York timber buildings are allowed; for illustrations of these see the
  article <span class="sc">Carpentry</span>. In public buildings and
  theatres in London, Paris and New York not only the construction, but
  also the exits and seating accommodation and stage, including the scenery
  dock and flies, must conform to certain regulations.</p>

  <p>The conditions necessary for planning a successful building may be
  summarized as follows:&mdash;(1) Ease of access; (2) Good <span
  class="sidenote">Conditions necessary for a successful building.</span>
  light (3) Good service; (4) Pleasing environment and approaches; (5)
  Minimum cost with true economy; in the case of office buildings, also
  ease of rearrangement to suit tenants. An architect should also be
  practically acquainted with all the modes of operation in all the trades
  or arts employed in building, and be able minutely to estimate beforehand
  the absolute cost involved in the execution of a proposed structure. The
  power to do this necessarily involves that of measuring work (usually
  done by the quantity surveyor at an advanced stage of the work), and of
  ascertaining the quantities to be done. In ordinary practice the
  architect usually cubes a building at a price per foot cube, as will be
  described hereafter, but an architect should know how to measure and
  prepare quantities, or he cannot be said to be master of his
  profession.</p>

  <p>Building includes what is called construction, which is the branch of
  the science of architecture relating to the practical <span
  class="sidenote">Construction.</span> execution of the works required to
  produce any structure; it will therefore be necessary to explain the
  subject in a general manner before entering upon building in detail.</p>

  <p>Although the styles of architecture have varied at different periods,
  buildings, wherever similar materials are employed, must be constructed
  on much the same principles. Scientific knowledge of the natures and
  properties of materials has, however, given to the modern workman immense
  advantages over his medieval brother-craftsman, and caused many changes
  in the details of the trade, or art of building, although stones, bricks,
  mortar, &amp;c., then as now, formed the element of the more solid parts
  of all edifices.</p>

  <p>The object of constructions is to adapt, combine and fit materials in
  such a manner that they shall retain in use the <span
  class="sidenote">General principles.</span> forms and dispositions
  assigned to them. If an upright wall be properly constructed upon a
  sufficient foundation, the combined mass will retain its position and
  bear pressure acting in the direction of gravity to any extent that the
  ground on which it stands, and the compound materials of the wall, can
  sustain. But pressure acting laterally has a necessary tendency to
  overthrow a wall, and therefore it will be the aim of the constructor to
  compel, as far as possible, all forces that can act upon an upright wall,
  to act in the direction of gravity, or else to give it permanent means of
  resistance in the direction opposite to that in which a disturbing force
  may act. Thus when an arch is built to bear against an upright wall, a
  buttress or other counterfort is applied in a direction opposed to the
  pressure of the arch. In like manner the inclined roof of a building
  spanning from wall to wall tends to thrust out the walls, and hence a tie
  is applied to hold the opposite sides of the roof together at its base,
  where alone a tie can be fully efficient, and thus the roof is made to
  act upon the walls wholly in the direction of gravity; or where an
  efficient tie is inapplicable, as in the case of a hammer beam roof,
  buttresses or counterforts are added to the walls, to enable them to
  resist the pressure outwards. A beam laid horizontally from wall to wall,
  as a girder to carry a floor and its load, may sag or bend downwards, and
  tend thereby to force out the walls, or the beam itself may break. Both
  these contingencies are obviated by trussing, which renders the beam
  stiff enough to place its load on the walls in the direction of gravity,
  and strong enough to carry it safely. Or if the beam be rigid in its
  nature, or uncertain in its structure, or both (as cast-iron is), and
  will break without bending, the constructor by the smiths' art will
  supply a check and ensure it against the possible contingency.</p>

  <p>Perfect stability, however, is not to be obtained with materials which
  are subject to influences beyond the control of man, and all matter is
  subject to certain influences of that nature. The <span
  class="sidenote">Materials.</span> influences mostly to be contended
  against are heat and humidity, the former of which produces movement of
  some kind or to some extent in all bodies, the latter, in many kinds of
  matter; whilst the two acting together contribute to the disintegration
  or decay of materials available for the purposes of construction. These
  pervading influences the constructor seeks to counteract, by proper
  selection and disposition of his materials.</p>

  <p>Stone and brick, the principal materials in general construction, keep
  their places in combination by means of gravity. They may <span
  class="sidenote">Stone.</span> be merely packed together, but in general
  they are compacted by means of mortar or cement, so that although the
  main constituent materials are wholly incompressible, masses of either,
  or of both, combined in structures are compressible, until the setting
  medium has indurated to a like condition of hardness. That kind of stone
  is best fitted for the purposes of general construction which is least
  absorbent of moisture, and at the same time free to work. Absorbent stone
  exposed to the weather rapidly disintegrates, and for the most part
  non-absorbent stone is so hard that it cannot always be used with a due
  regard to economy. When, therefore, suitable stone of both qualities can
  be obtained, the harder stone can be exposed to the weather, or to the
  action which the softer stone cannot resist, and made to form the main
  body of the structure of the latter so protected. The hard and the soft
  should be made to bear alike, and should therefore be coursed and bonded
  together by the mason's art, whether the work be of stone wrought into
  blocks and gauged to thickness, or of rough dressed or otherwise unshaped
  rubble compacted with mortar.</p>

  <p>Good bricks are less absorbent of moisture than any stone of the same
  degree of hardness, and are better non-conductors <span
  class="sidenote">Bricks.</span> of heat than stone. As the basis of a
  stable structure, brickwork is more to be relied upon than stone in the
  form of rubble, when the constituents bear the relation to one another
  last above referred to, the setting material being the same in both;
  because the brick by its shaped form seats itself truly, and produces by
  bonding a more perfectly combined mass, whilst the imperfectly shaped and
  variously sized stone as dressed rubble can neither bed nor bond truly,
  the inequalities of the form having to be compensated for with mortar,
  and the irregularity of size of the main constituent accounted for by the
  introduction of larger and smaller stones. The most perfect stability is
  to be obtained, nevertheless, from truly wrought and accurately seated
  and bonded blocks of stone, mortar being used to no greater extent than
  may be necessary to exclude wind and water and prevent the disintegrating
  action of these agents upon even the most durable stone. When water alone
  is to be dealt with, and especially when it is liable to act with force,
  mortar is necessary for securing to every block in the structure its own
  full weight, and the aid of every other collateral and superimposed
  stone, in order to resist the loosening effect which water in powerful
  action is bound to produce.</p>

  <p>In the application of construction to any particular object, the
  nature of the object will naturally affect the character of <span
  class="sidenote">Particular objects of construction.</span> the
  constructions and the materials of which they are to be formed. Every
  piece of construction should be complete in itself, and independent as
  such of everything beyond it. A door or a gate serves its purpose by an
  application wholly foreign to itself, but it is a good and effective, or
  a bad and ineffective, piece of construction, independently of the posts
  to which it may be hung, whilst the wheel of a wheelbarrow, comprising
  felloes, spokes and axletree, is a piece of construction complete in
  itself, and independent as such of everything beyond it. An arch of
  masonry, however large it may be, is not necessarily a piece of
  construction complete in itself, for it would fall to pieces without
  abutments. Thus a bridge consisting of a series of arches, however
  extensive, may be but one piece of construction, no arch being complete
  in itself without the collateral arches in the series to serve as its
  abutments, and the whole series being dependent thereby upon <!-- Page
  764 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page764"></a>[v.04
  p.0764]</span>the ultimate abutments of the bridge, without which the
  structure would not stand. This illustration is not intended to apply to
  the older bridges with widely distended masses, which render each pier
  sufficient to abut the arches springing from it, but tend, in providing
  for a way over the river, to choke up the way by the river itself, or to
  compel the river either to throw down the structure or else to destroy
  its own banks.</p>

  <p>Some soils are liable to change in form, expanding and contracting
  under meteorological influences; such are clays which <span
  class="sidenote">Foundations.</span> swell when wetted and shrink when
  dried. Concrete foundations are commonly interposed upon such soils to
  protect the building from derangement from this cause; or walls of the
  cheaper material, concrete, instead of the more expensive brick or stone
  structure, are brought up from a level sufficiently below the ordinary
  surface of the ground. When concrete is used to obviate the tendency of
  the soil to yield to pressure, expanse or extent of base is required, and
  the concrete being widely spread should therefore be deep or thick as a
  layer, only with reference to its own power of transmitting to the ground
  the weight of the wall to be built upon it, without breaking across or
  being crushed. But when concrete is used as a substitute for a wall, in
  carrying a wall down to a low level, it is in fact a wall in itself, wide
  only in proportion to its comparative weakness in the absence of
  manipulated bond in its construction, and encased by the soil within
  which it is placed. When a concrete wall is used in place of brick the
  London Building Act requires an extra thickness of one-third; on the
  question of reinforced concrete no regulations as to thickness have at
  present been made.</p>

  <p>The foundation of a building of ordinary weight is for the most part
  sufficiently provided for by applying what are technically <span
  class="sidenote">Footings to walls.</span> termed "footings" to the
  walls. The reason for a footing is, that the wall obtains thereby a
  bearing upon a breadth of ground so much greater than its own width or
  thickness above the footing as to compensate for the difference between
  the power of resisting pressure of the wall, and of the ground or
  ultimate foundation upon which the wall is to rest. It will be clear from
  this that if a building is to be erected upon rock as hard as the main
  constituent of the walls theoretically no expanded footings will be
  necessary; if upon chalk, upon strong or upon weak gravel, upon sand or
  upon clay, the footing must be expanded with reference to the power of
  resistance of the structure to be used as a foundation; whilst in or upon
  made ground or other loose and badly combined or imperfectly resisting
  soil, a solid platform bearing evenly over the ground, and wide enough
  not to sink into it, becomes necessary under the constructed footing. For
  this purpose the easiest, the most familiar, and for most purposes the
  most effectual and durable is a layer of concrete.</p>

  <p>The English government, when it has legislated upon building matters,
  has generally confined itself to making provision that the enclosing
  walls of buildings should be formed of incombustible materials. In
  provisions regarding the least thicknesses of such walls, these were
  generally determined with reference to the height and length of the
  building.</p>

  <p>In the general and usual practice of developing land at the present
  day, the owner or freeholder of the land first consults an <span
  class="sidenote">Procedure for an intended building.</span> architect and
  states his intentions of building, the size of what he requires, what it
  is to be used for, if for trade how many hands he intends to employ, and
  the sub-buildings and departments, &amp;c., that will be wanted. The
  architect gathers as much information as he can as to his client's
  requirements, and from this information prepares his sketches. This first
  step is usually done with rough sketches or outlines only, and when
  approved by the client as regards the planning and situation of rooms,
  &amp;c., the architect prepares the plans, elevations, and sections on
  the lines of the approved rough sketches; at the same time he strictly
  observes the building acts, and makes every portion of the building
  comply with these acts as regards the thickness of walls, open spaces,
  light and air, distances from surrounding property, frontage lines, and a
  host of other points too numerous to mention, as far as he can interpret
  the meaning of the enactments. (The London and New York Building Acts are
  very extensive, with numerous amendments made as occasion requires.) An
  architect, whilst preparing the working drawings from the rough approved
  sketches, and endeavouring to conform with the Building Act requirements,
  often finds after consultation with the district surveyor, or the London
  County Council, or other local authorities, that the plans have to be
  altered; and when so altered the client may disapprove of them, and thus
  delay often occurs in settling them.</p>

  <p>Another important point is that after the architect has obtained the
  consent of the building authorities, and also the approval of the client,
  then he may have to fight the adjoining owners with regard to ancient
  lights, or air space, or party walls. In the city of London these last
  difficulties often mean the suspension of the work for a long time, and a
  great loss to the client.</p>

  <p>If the site is a large one, or the nature of the soil uncertain, trial
  holes should be sunk directly the sketch plans are approved. (See <span
  class="sc">Foundations</span>.)</p>

  <p>Where the property is leasehold there are always at this stage
  negotiations as to obtaining the approval of the senior lessors and the
  freeholders; these having been obtained, the architect is then free to
  serve the various notices that may be required <i>re</i> party walls,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The contract plans should be very carefully prepared, and sections,
  plans and elevations of all parts of the buildings and the levels from a
  datum line be given. In addition to the general set of drawings, larger
  scale details of the principal portions of the building should be
  given.</p>

  <p>If there are any existing buildings on the site these should be
  carefully surveyed and accurate detail plans be made for reference; this
  is especially necessary with regard to easements and rights of adjoining
  owners. Also in the preparation of the site plan the various levels of
  the ground should be shown.</p>

  <p>The plans having been approved by all parties concerned, the next
  operation is the preparation of the <i>specification</i>. This is a
  document which describes the materials to be used in the building, states
  how they are to be mixed, and how the various works are to be executed,
  and specifies every trade, and every portion of work in the building. The
  specification is necessary to enable the builder to erect the structure
  according to the architect's requirements, and is written by the
  architect; usually two copies of this document are made, one for the
  builder, the other for the architect, and the latter is signed as the
  contract copy in the same manner as the drawings.</p>

  <p>From the specification and drawings usually an approximate estimate of
  the cost of the proposed building is prepared by the architect, and the
  most general method adopted is to cube the building by a multiplication
  of the length, breadth and height of the building, and to multiply the
  product or cubic contents by a price ranging from fivepence to three
  shillings per cubic foot. In the case of churches, chapels and schools,
  the cost may be roughly computed by taking the number of seats at a price
  per seat. In the case of churches and chapels, taking a minimum area of 8
  ft. each, the cost varies from £10 upwards, the difference being due to
  the amount of architectural embellishment or the addition of a tower.
  Schools may be estimated as averaging £9 per scholar; we find that,
  taking schools of various sizes erected by the late London School Board,
  their cost varied from £7:12:4 to £10:1:10 per scholar. Hospitals vary
  from £100 per bed upwards, the lowest cost being taken from a cottage
  hospital type; while in the case of St Thomas's hospital, London, the
  cost per bed, including the proportion of the administrative block, was
  £650, and without this portion the wards alone cost £250. The Herbert
  hospital at Woolwich cost only £320 per bed.</p>

  <p>The bills of quantities are prepared by the quantity surveyor, and are
  generally made to form part of the contract, and so mentioned in "the
  contract." The work of the quantity surveyor is to measure from the
  drawings the whole of the materials required for the structure, and state
  the amounts or quantities of the respective materials in the form of a
  bill usually made out on foolscap paper specially ruled, so that <!--
  Page 765 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page765"></a>[v.04
  p.0765]</span>the builders can price each item, together with the labour
  required to work and fix it, thus forming the building. The idea is to be
  able to arrive at a lump sum for which the builders will undertake to
  erect the building. It is of frequent occurrence, in fact it occurs in
  four-fifths of building contracts, that when a building is commenced, the
  client, or other interested person, will alter some portion, thereby
  causing deviations from the bills of quantities. By having the prices of
  the different materials before him, it is easy for the quantity surveyor
  to remeasure the portion altered, adding or deducting as the case may be,
  and thus to ascertain what difference the alteration makes. This method
  of bills of quantities and prices is absolutely necessary to any one
  about to build, and means a considerable saving to the client in the end.
  For example:&mdash;Suppose that bills of quantities are not prepared for
  a certain job by a quantity surveyor, and, as is often done, the drawings
  and specification are sent to several builders asking them for a
  quotation to build the house or factory or whatever it may be, according
  to the drawings and specification. The prices are duly sent in to the
  architect, and probably the lowest price is accepted and the successful
  builder starts the job. During the progress of the works certain
  alterations take place by the owner's instructions, and when the day of
  settlement comes, the builder puts in his claim for "extras," then owing
  to the alterations and to the architect having no prices to work upon,
  litigation often ensues.</p>

  <p>Before the work of erecting a structure is entrusted to a builder he
  has to sign a contract in the same manner as the drawings and
  specification. This contract is an important document wherein the builder
  agrees to carry out the work for a stated sum of money, in accordance
  with the drawings and specification, and bills of quantities, and
  instructions of the architect, and to his entire satisfaction; and it
  also states the description of the materials and workmanship, and the
  manner of carrying out the work, responsibilities of the builder,
  particularly clauses indemnifying the employer against accidents to
  employees, and against numerous other risks, the time of completion of
  works under a penalty for non-completion (the usual allowance being made
  for bad weather, fire or strikes), and also how payments will be made to
  the builder as he proceeds with the building. This form of contract is
  generally prepared by the architect, and varies in part as may be
  necessary to meet the requirements of the case.</p>

  <p>When the drawings have been approved by the owner or client, also by
  the district surveyor or local authorities, and by adjoining owners, one
  copy of them, made on linen, is usually deposited (in London) either with
  the district surveyor, or with the London County Council, another is
  prepared for the freeholder if a lease of the land is granted, and a
  third is given to the builder. In addition, in complicated cases such as
  occur in the city of London, when a building is erected on land which has
  four or five distinct owners, an architect may have to prepare a large
  number of complete copies to be deposited with the various parties
  interested.</p>

  <p>The duties of the builder are very similar to those of the architect,
  except that he is not expected to be able to plan <span
  class="sidenote">The builder's sphere.</span> and design, but to carry
  out the plans and designs of the architect in the actual work of
  building. The builder should also know the various acts, and in
  particular the acts specially relating to the erection of scaffoldings,
  hoardings, gantries, shoring and pulling down of old buildings. He should
  have a thorough knowledge of all materials, their qualifying marks or
  brands, and the special features of good and bad in each class, their
  uses and method of use. He should be able to control and manage both the
  men and materials; and briefly, in a builder, as opposed to an architect,
  the constructive knowledge should predominate.</p>

  <p>On large or important works it is usual to have a clerk of works or
  delegate from the architect; his duties are to be on the works while they
  are in progress and endeavour by constant attention to secure the use of
  the best materials and construction, and to report to the architect for
  his instruction any difficulties that may arise. He should be a
  thoroughly practical man as opposed to the architectural draughtsman. His
  salary is paid by the client, and is not included in the architect's
  remuneration.</p>

  <p>American building acts agree in a general manner with those enforced
  in London. But whereas New York allows the erection <span
  class="sidenote">American practice.</span> of frame or wood structures,
  while defining a certain portion of the city inside which no new frame or
  wood structures shall be erected, in London and the large cities of Great
  Britain the erection of wood frame buildings as dwellings is prohibited.
  In New York City provision is made for a space at the rear of domestic
  buildings at least 10 ft. deep, but such depth is increased when the
  building is over 60 ft. high, and is varied under special circumstances.
  In London this depth is the same, but the height of the building in
  relation to the space required in the rear thereof shall be constructed
  to keep within an angle of 63½ degrees, inclining from the rear boundary
  towards the building from the level of pavement in front of building; the
  position from which the angle is taken is varied under special
  circumstances. In the smaller English towns the building regulations are
  framed on the model by-laws, and these increase the depth of the yard or
  garden according to the height of the building.</p>

  <p>With regard to the strength and proportion of materials, these are not
  dealt with in the London Building Act to the same extent as in the New
  York; for example, in the New York acts (parts 4 and 5)<a
  name="FnAnchor_362" href="#Footnote_362"><sup>[2]</sup></a> it is
  prescribed that the bricks used shall be good, hard, well-burned bricks.
  The sand used for mortar shall be clean, sharp, grit sand, free from loam
  or dirt, and shall not be finer than the standard samples kept in the
  office of the department of buildings; also the quality of lime and
  mortar is fully described, and the strengths of steel and cast-iron, and
  tests of new materials. Also it is required that all excavations for
  buildings shall be properly guarded and protected so as to prevent them
  from becoming dangerous to life or limb, and shall be sheath-piled where
  necessary by the person or persons causing the excavations to be made, to
  prevent the adjoining earth from caving in. Plans filed in the department
  of buildings shall be accompanied by a statement of the character of the
  soil at the level of the footings. There are also requirements as to
  protecting adjoining property. The bearing capacity of soils, pressure
  under footings of foundations, and in part 6 the materials of walls and
  the methods to be observed in building them are defined. Part 23 deals
  with floor loads, and the strength of floors constructed of various
  materials, and requires that the temporary support shall be strong enough
  to carry the load placed upon them during the progress of any works to
  buildings. Part 24 deals with the calculations and strength of materials,
  and wind pressure. Parts 4 and 5 of the New York Building Code are not
  dealt with by the London Building Act, but the local by-laws of the
  various districts deal with these. Part 6 of the New York code is dealt
  with partly by the London Building Act, and partly by the local by-laws.
  Parts 23 and 24 of the New York code are not dealt with in the English
  acts at all. In America the standard quality for all materials is set
  out, but in no English acts do we find the definition of the quality of
  timber, new materials, steel, &amp;c. Iron and steel construction is in
  its infancy in England as compared with America, and probably this
  accounts for no special regulations being in force; but part 22 of the
  New York Building Code, section 110 to 129 inclusive, deals very fully
  with iron and steel construction, and this is further supplemented by
  sections 137 to 140 inclusive.</p>

  <p>Sanitary work is dealt with in London by section 39 of the Public
  Health (London) Act, and the drainage by-laws of the London County
  Council, in which every detail is very fully gone into with regard to the
  laying of drains, and fitting up of soil pipes, w.c.'s, &amp;c., all of
  which is to be carried out and tested to the satisfaction of the local
  borough's sanitary inspector. The general requirements of New York with
  regard to sanitary work are very similar with a few more restrictions,
  and are carried out under "the rules and regulations for plumbing,
  drainage, <!-- Page 766 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page766"></a>[v.04 p.0766]</span>water-supply, and ventilation of
  buildings." The noticeable feature of the New York regulations is that
  all master plumbers have to be registered, which is not so in England.
  The New York regulations have 183 sections relating to sanitary work, and
  the English regulations have 96 sections. Also by part 16 of the
  Amendments to Plumbing Rules 1903, the New York laws require that, before
  any construction of, or alterations to, any gas piping or fittings are
  commenced, permits must be obtained from the superintendent of buildings;
  these are only issued to a registered plumber. The application must be
  accompanied by plans of the different floors showing each outlet, and the
  number of burners to each outlet; a statement must also be made of the
  quality of the pipes and fittings, all of which are to be tested by the
  inspector. In London there are no such laws; the gas companies control a
  small portion of the work as regards the connexion to meters, while the
  insurance companies require gas jets to be covered with a wire guard
  where liable to come in contact with inflammable goods. As to water, the
  various water companies in England have each their own set of regulations
  as to the kind of fittings and thickness and quality of pipe to be used,
  whether for service, wastes or main.</p>

  <p>The importance of fire-resisting construction is being more fully
  recognized now by all countries. In France the regulations <span
  class="sidenote">Fire-resisting construction.</span> for factories, shops
  and workshops relating to "exits" require that all doors should open
  outwardly when they open on to courts, vestibules, staircases or interior
  passages. When they give access to the open air, outward opening is not
  obligatory unless it has been judged necessary in the interests of
  safety. If the doors open on to a passage or staircase they must be fixed
  in such a manner as not to project into the passage or staircase when
  open. The exits must be numerous, and signs indicating the quickest way
  out are to be placed in conspicuous positions. The windows are to open
  outwardly. Staircases in offices or other buildings serving as places for
  work shall be constructed in incombustible materials, or shall be walled
  in fully in plaster. The number of staircases shall be in proportion to
  the number of employees, &amp;c. It is prohibited to use any liquid
  emitting vapours inflammable under 35° C. for the purpose of lighting or
  heating, unless the apparatus containing the liquid is solidly closed
  during work, that part of the apparatus containing the liquid being so
  closed as to avoid any oozing out of the liquid, &amp;c. &amp;c.
  Instructions are added as to precautions to be taken in case of fire.</p>

  <p>In London fire-resisting construction is dealt with in the London
  Building Act, and its second schedule, and in London County Council
  Theatre and Factory Acts, &amp;c. In New York the building code (parts
  19, 20 and 21) deals with fire appliances, escapes, and fire-proof
  shutters and doors, fire-proof buildings and fire-proof floors, and
  requires that all tenement houses shall have an iron ladder for escape. A
  section somewhat similar to the last came into force in London in 1907
  under the London Building Act, being framed with a view to require all
  existing projecting one-storey shops to have a fire-resisting roof, and
  all existing buildings over 50 ft. in height to have means of escape to
  and from the roof in case of fire.</p>

  <p>There are several patents now in use with which it would be possible
  to erect a fire-proof dwelling at small cost with walls 3 to 5 in. in
  thickness. One of these has been used where the building act does not
  apply, as in the case of the Newgate prison cells, London, where the
  outside walls were from 3 to 4 in. thick only, and were absolutely fire
  and burglar proof. This method consists in using steel dovetailed sheets
  fixed between small steel stanchions and plastered in cement on both
  sides. This form of construction was also used at the British pavilion,
  Paris Exhibition 1900, and has been employed in numerous other buildings
  in England, and also in South Africa, Venezuela, and India (Delhi
  durbar). The use of many of these convenient and sound forms of building
  construction for ordinary buildings in London, and in districts of
  England where the model by-laws are in force, is prohibited because they
  do not comply with some one or other of the various clauses relating to
  materials, or to the thickness of a wall.</p>

  <p>The various details of construction are described and illustrated
  under separate headings. See <span class="sc">Brickwork, Carpentry,

  <p><b>BUILDING SOCIETIES,</b> the name given to societies "for the
  purpose of raising, by the subscriptions of the members, a stock or fund
  for making advances to members out of the funds of the society upon
  freehold, copyhold, or leasehold estate by way of mortgage," may be
  "either <i>terminating</i> or <i>permanent</i>" (Building Societies Act
  1874, § 13). A "terminating" society is one "which by its rules is to
  terminate at a fixed date, or when a result specified in its rules is
  attained"; a "permanent" society is one "which has not by its rules any
  such fixed date or specified result, at which it shall terminate" (§ 5).
  A more popular description of these societies would be&mdash;societies by
  means of which every man may become "his own landlord," their main
  purpose being to collect together the small periodical subscriptions of a
  number of members, until each in his turn has been able to receive a sum
  sufficient to aid him materially in buying his dwelling-house. The origin
  and early history of these societies is not very clearly traceable. A
  mention of "building clubs" in Birmingham occurs in 1795; one is known to
  have been established by deed in the year 1809 at Greenwich; another is
  said to have been founded in 1825, under the auspices of the earl of
  Selkirk at Kirkcudbright in Scotland, and we learn (Scratchley, <i>On
  Building Societies</i>, p. 5) that similar societies in that kingdom
  adopted the title of "menages."</p>

  <p><i>United Kingdom.</i>&mdash;When the Friendly Societies Act of 1834
  gave effect to the wise and liberal policy of extending its benefits to
  societies for frugal investment, and generally to all associations having
  a similar legal object, several building societies were certified under
  it,&mdash;so many, indeed, that in 1836 a short act was passed confirming
  to them the privileges granted by the Friendly Societies Act, and
  according to them the additional privileges (very valuable at that time)
  of exemption from the usury laws, simplicity in forms of conveyance,
  power to reconvey by a mere endorsement under the hands of the trustees
  for the time being, and exemption from stamp duty. This act remained
  unaltered until 1874, when an act was passed at the instance of the
  building societies conferring upon them several other privileges, and
  relieving them of some disabilities and doubts, which had grown up from
  the judicial expositions of the act of 1836. It made future building
  societies incorporated bodies, and extended the privilege of
  incorporation to existing societies upon application, so that members and
  all who derive title through them were relieved from having to trace that
  title through the successive trustees of a society. It also gave a
  distinct declaration to the members of entire freedom from liability to
  pay anything beyond the arrears due from them at the time of winding up,
  or the amount actually secured by their mortgage deeds. Power to borrow
  money was also expressly given to the societies by the act, but upon two
  conditions: that the limitation of liability must be made known to the
  lender, by being printed on the acknowledgment for the loan, and that the
  borrowed money must not exceed two-thirds of the amount secured by
  mortgage from the members, or, in a terminating society, one year's
  income from subscriptions. Previous to the passing of the act (or rather
  to the judicial decision in <i>Laing</i> v. <i>Read</i>, which the clause
  of the act made statutory) there had been, on the one hand, grave doubts
  on high legal authority whether a society could borrow money at all;
  while, on the other hand, many societies in order to raise funds carried
  on the business of deposit banks to an extent far exceeding the amounts
  used by them for their legitimate purpose of investment on mortgage. It
  enacted, that if a society borrowed more than the statute authorizes, the
  directors accepting the loan should be personally <!-- Page 767 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page767"></a>[v.04 p.0767]</span>responsible for
  the excess. By an act passed in 1894 all the Benefit Building Societies
  established under the act of 1836 after the year 1856 were required to
  become incorporated under the act of 1874.</p>

  <p>There are, therefore, three categories of building
  societies:&mdash;(1) Those established before 1856, which have not been
  incorporated under the act of 1874 and remain under the act of 1836. (2)
  Those established before 1874 under the act of 1836, which have been
  incorporated under the act of 1874. (3) Those which have been established
  since the act of 1874 was passed. The first class still act by means of
  trustees. Of these societies there are only 62 remaining in existence,
  and their number cannot be increased. The second and third classes exceed
  2000 in number.</p>

  <p>The early societies were all "terminating,"&mdash;consisting of a
  limited number of members, and coming to an end as soon as every member
  had received the amount agreed upon as the value of his shares. Take, as
  a simple typical example of the working of such a society, one the shares
  of which are £120 each, realizable by subscriptions of 10s. a month
  during 14 years. Fourteen years happens to be nearly the time in which,
  at 5% compound interest, a sum of money becomes doubled. Hence the
  present value, at the commencement of the society, of the £120 to be
  realized at its conclusion, or (what is the same thing) of the
  subscriptions of 10s. a month by which that £120 is to be raised, is £60.
  If such a society had issued 120 shares, the aggregate subscriptions for
  the first month of its existence would amount to exactly the sum required
  to pay one member the present value of one share. One member would
  accordingly receive a sum down of £60, and in order to protect the other
  members from loss, would execute a mortgage of his dwelling-house for
  ensuring the payment of the future subscription of 10s. per month until
  every member had in like manner obtained an advance upon his shares, or
  accumulated the £120 per share. As £60 is not of itself enough to buy a
  house, even of the most modest kind, every member desirous of using the
  society for its original purpose of obtaining a dwelling-house by its
  means would require to take more than one share. The act of 1836 limited
  the amount of each share to £150, and the amount of the monthly
  contributions on each share to £1, but did not limit the number of shares
  a member might hold.</p>

  <p>The earlier formed societies (in London at least) did not usually
  adopt the title "Building Society"; or they added to it some further
  descriptive title, as "Accumulating Fund," "Savings Fund," or "Investment
  Association." Several are described as "Societies for obtaining freehold
  property," or simply as "Mutual Associations," or "Societies of
  Equality." The building societies in Scotland are mostly called "Property
  Investment," or "Economic." Although the term "Benefit Building Society"
  occurs in the title to the act of 1836, it was not till 1849 that it
  became in England the sole distinctive name of these societies; and it
  cannot be said to be a happy description of them, for as ordinarily
  constituted they undertake no building operations whatever, and merely
  advance money to their members to enable them to build or to buy
  dwelling-houses or land.</p>

  <p>The name "Building Society," too, leaves wholly out of sight the
  important functions these societies fulfil as means of investment of
  small savings. The act of 1836 defined them as societies to enable every
  member to receive the amount or value of a share or shares to erect or
  purchase a dwelling-house, &amp;c., but a member who did not desire to
  erect or purchase a dwelling-house might still receive out of the funds
  of the society the amount or value of his shares, improved by the
  payments of interest made by those to whom shares had been advanced.</p>

  <p>About 1846 an important modification of the system of these societies
  was introduced, by the invention of the "permanent" plan, which was
  adopted by a great number of the societies established after that date.
  It was seen that these societies really consist of two classes of
  members; that those who do not care to have, or have not yet received, an
  advance upon mortgage security are mere investors, and that it matters
  little when they commence investing, or to what amount; while those to
  whom advances have been made are really debtors to the society, and
  arrangements for enabling them to pay off their debt in various terms of
  years, according to their convenience, would be of advantage both to
  themselves and the society. By permitting members to enter at any time
  without back-payment, and by granting advances for any term of years
  agreed upon, a continuous inflow of funds, and a continuous means of
  profitable investment of them, would be secured. The interest of each
  member in the society would terminate when his share was realized, or his
  advance paid off, but the society would continue with the accruing
  subscriptions of other members employed in making other advances.</p>

  <p>Under this system building societies largely increased and developed.
  The royal commissioners who inquired into the subject in 1872 estimated
  the total assets of the societies in 1870 at 17 millions, and their
  annual income at 11 millions. The more complete returns, afterwards
  obtained, indicate that this was an under-estimate.</p>

  <p>A variety of the terminating class of societies met at one time with
  considerable favour under the name of "Starr Bowkett" or "mutual"
  societies, of which more than a thousand were established. They differed
  from the typical society above described, in the contribution of a member
  who had not received an advance being much smaller, while the amount of
  the advance was much larger, and it was made without any calculation of
  interest. Thus a society issued, say, 500 shares, on which the
  contributions were to be 1s. 3d. per week, and, as soon as a sum of £300
  accumulated allotted it by ballot to one of the shareholders, on
  condition that he was to repay it without interest by instalments in 10
  or 12½ years, and at the same time to keep up his share-contributions.
  The fortunate recipient of the appropriation was at liberty to sell it,
  and frequently did so at a profit; but (except from fines) no profit
  whatever was earned by those who did not succeed in getting an
  appropriation, and as the number of members successful in the ballot must
  necessarily be small in the earlier years of the society, the others
  frequently became discontented and retired. These societies could not
  borrow money, for as they received no interest they could not pay any.
  The plan was afterwards modified by granting the appropriations
  alternately by ballot and sale, so that by the premiums paid on the sales
  (which are the same in effect as payments of interest on the amount
  actually advanced) profits might be earned for the investing members. The
  formation of societies of this class ceased on the passing of the act of
  1894, by which balloting for advances was prohibited in societies
  thereafter established. A further modification of the "mutual" plan was
  to make all the appropriations by sale. The effect of this was to bring
  the mutual society back to the ordinary form; for it amounts to precisely
  the same thing for a man to pay 10s. a month on a loan of £60 for 14
  years, as for him to borrow a nominal sum of £84 for the same period,
  repayable in the same manner, but to allow £24 off the loan as a
  "bidding" at the sale. The only difference between the two classes of
  societies is that the interest which the member pays who bids for his
  advance depends on the amount of competition at the bidding, and is not
  fixed by a rule of the society.</p>

  <p>For several years the progress of building societies in general was
  steady, but there were not wanting signs that their prosperity was
  unsubstantial. A practice of receiving deposits repayable at call had
  sprung up, which must lead to embarrassment where the funds are invested
  in loans repayable during a long term of years. It was surmised, if not
  actually known, that many societies had large amounts of property on
  their hands, which had been reduced into possession in consequence of the
  default of borrowers in paying their instalments. A practice had also
  grown up of establishing mushroom societies, which did little more than
  pay fees to the promoters. The vicious system of trafficking in advances
  that had been awarded by ballot, near akin to gambling, prevailed in many
  societies. These signs of weakness had been observed by the
  well-informed, and the disastrous failure of a large society incorporated
  under <!-- Page 768 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page768"></a>[v.04
  p.0768]</span>the act of 1874, the Liberator, which had in fact long
  ceased to do any genuine building society business, hastened the
  crisis.</p>

  <p>This society had drawn funds to the amount of more than a million
  sterling from provident people in <span class="sidenote">The
  "Liberator."</span> all classes of the population and all parts of the
  country by specious representations, and had applied those funds not to
  the legitimate purpose of a building society, but to the support of other
  undertakings in which the same persons were concerned who were the active
  managers of the society. The consequence was that the whole group of
  concerns became insolvent (Oct. 1892), and the Liberator depositors and
  shareholders were defrauded of every penny of their investments. Many of
  them suffered great distress from the loss of their savings, and some
  were absolutely ruined. The result was to weaken confidence in building
  societies generally, and this was very marked in the rapid decline of the
  amount of the capital of the incorporated building societies. From its
  highest point (nearly 54 millions) reached in 1887, it fell to below 43
  millions in 1895. On some societies, which had adopted the deposit
  system, a run was made, and several were unable to stand it. The Birkbeck
  Society was for two days besieged by an anxious crowd of depositors
  clamouring to withdraw their money; but luckily for that society, and for
  the building societies generally, a very large portion of its funds was
  invested in easily convertible securities, and it was enabled by that
  means to get sufficient assistance from the Bank of England to pay
  without a moment's hesitation every depositor who asked for his money.
  Its credit was so firmly established by this means that many persons
  sought to pay money in. Had this very large society succumbed, the
  results would have been disastrous to the whole body of building
  societies. As the case stood, the energetic means it adopted to save its
  own credit reacted in favour of the societies generally.</p>

  <p>The Liberator disaster convinced everybody that something must be done
  towards avoiding such calamities in the future. The government of the day
  brought in a bill for that purpose, and several private members also
  prepared measures&mdash;most of them more stringent than the government
  bill. All the bills were referred to a select committee, of which Mr
  Herbert Gladstone was the chairman. As the result of the deliberations of
  the committee, the Building Societies Act of 1894 was passed. Meanwhile
  the Rt. Hon. W.L. Jackson (afterwards Lord Allerton), a member of the
  committee, moved for an address to the crown for a return of the property
  held in possession by building societies. This was the first time such a
  return had been called for, and the managers of the societies much
  resented it; there were no means of enforcing the return, and the
  consequence was that many large societies failed to make it,
  notwithstanding frequent applications by the registrar. The act provided
  that henceforth all incorporated societies should furnish returns in a
  prescribed form, including schedules showing respectively the mortgages
  for amounts exceeding £5000; the properties of which the societies had
  taken possession for more than twelve months through default of the
  mortgagors; and the mortgages which were more than twelve months in
  arrear of repayment subscription. The act did not come into operation
  till the 1st of January 1895, and the first complete return under it was
  not due till 1896, when it appeared that the properties in possession at
  the time of Mr Jackson's return must have been counted for at least seven
  and a half millions in the assets of the societies. In a few years after
  the passing of the act the societies reduced their properties in
  possession from 14% of the whole of the mortgages to 5%, or, in other
  words, reduced them to one-third of the original amount, from 7½ millions
  to 2½ millions. Though this operation must have been attended with some
  sacrifice in many societies, upon the whole the balance of profit has
  increased rather than diminished. Thus this provision of the act, though
  it greatly alarmed the managers of societies, was really a blessing in
  disguise. The act also gave power to the registrar, upon the application
  of ten members, to order an inspection of the books of a society, but it
  did not confer upon individual members the right to inspect the books,
  which would have been more effective. It empowered the registrar, upon
  the application of one-fifth of the members, to order an inspection upon
  oath into the affairs of a society, or to investigate its affairs with a
  view to dissolution, and even in certain cases to proceed without an
  application from members. It gave him ample powers to deal with a society
  which upon such investigation proved to be insolvent, and these were
  exercised so as to procure the cheap and speedy dissolution of such
  societies. It also prohibited the future establishment of societies
  making advances by ballot, or dependent on any chance or lot, and
  provided an easy method by which existing societies could discontinue the
  practice of balloting. This method has been adopted in a few instances
  only. The act, or the circumstances which led to it, has greatly
  diminished the number of new societies applying for registry.</p>

  <p>The statistics of building societies belonging to all the three
  classes mentioned show that there were on the 31st of December 1904, 2118
  societies in existence in the United Kingdom. Of these, 2075, having
  609,785 members, made returns. Their gross receipts for the financial
  year were £38,729,009, and the amount advanced on mortgage during the
  year was £9,589,864. The capital belonging to their members was
  £39,408,430, and the undivided balance of profit £4,004,547. Their
  liabilities to depositors and other creditors were £24,838,290. To meet
  this they had mortgages on which £53,196,112 was due, but of this
  £2,443,255 was on properties which had been in possession more than a
  year, and £222,444 on mortgages which had fallen into arrear more than a
  year. Their other assets were £14,952,485, and certain societies showed a
  deficit balance which in the aggregate was £102,670. As compared with
  1895, when first returns were obtained from unincorporated societies,
  these figures show an increase in income of 30%, in assets of 23%, and in
  profit balances of 46%, and a diminution of the properties in possession
  and mortgages in arrear of 14% in the nine years. The total assets and
  income are more than three times the amount of the conjectural estimate
  made for 1870 by the royal commission. It is not too much to say that a
  quarter of a million persons have been enabled by means of building
  societies to become the proprietors of their own homes.</p>

  <p>In recent years, several rivals to building societies have sprung up.
  Friendly societies have largely taken to investing their surplus funds in
  loans to members on the building society principle. Industrial and
  provident land and building societies have been formed. The legislature
  has authorized local authorities to lend money to the working classes to
  enable them to buy their dwelling-houses. Bond and investment companies
  have been formed under the Companies Acts, and are under no restriction
  as to balloting for appropriation. All these have not yet had any
  perceptible effect in checking the growth of the building society
  movement, and it is not thought that they will permanently do so.</p>

  <p><i>British Colonies.</i>&mdash;In several of the British colonies,
  legislation similar to that of the mother country has been adopted. In
  Victoria, Australia, a crisis occurred, in which many building societies
  suffered severely. In the other Australian colonies the building society
  movement has made progress, but not to a very large extent. In the
  Dominion of Canada these societies are sometimes called "loan companies"
  and are not restricted in their investments to loans on real estates, but
  about 90% of their advances are on that security. At the close of the
  year 1904 their liabilities to stockholders exceeded £13,000,000, and to
  the public £21,000,000. The uncalled capital was £5,000,000. The balance
  of current loans was £28,000,000, and the property owned by the societies
  exceeded £7,000,000.</p>

  <p><i>Belgium, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In Belgium, the Government Savings Bank
  has power to make advances of money to societies of credit or of
  construction to enable their members to become owners of dwelling-houses.
  The advance is made to the society at 3 or sometimes at 2½% interest, and
  the borrower pays 4%. In the great majority of cases the borrower effects
  an insurance with the savings bank so that his repayments terminate at
  his death. On the 31st of December 1903 nearly 25,000 advances were in
  course of repayment. In Germany, building societies are recognized as a
  form of societies for self-help, but are not many in number, being
  overshadowed by the great organization of credit societies founded by
  Schulze-Delitzsch. In other countries there has been no special
  legislation for building societies similar to that of the United Kingdom,
  and though societies with the same special object probably exist,
  separate information with regard to them is not available.</p>

  <p>(E. W. B.)</p>

  <p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;"Building and loan association" is a
  general term applied in the United States to such institutions as mutual
  loan associations, homestead aid associations, savings fund and loan
  associations, co-operative banks, co-operative savings and loan
  associations, &amp;c. They are private corporations, for the accumulation
  of savings, and for the loaning of money to build homes. The first
  association of this kind in the United States of which there is any
  record was organized at Frankford, a suburb <!-- Page 769 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page769"></a>[v.04 p.0769]</span>of
  Philadelphia, on the 3rd of January 1831, under the title of the Oxford
  Provident Building Association. Their permanent inception took place
  between 1840 and 1850. The receipts or capital of the building and loan
  association consists of periodical payments by the members, interest and
  premiums paid by borrowing members or others, fixed periodical
  instalments by borrowing members, fines for failures to pay such fixed
  instalments, forfeitures, fees for transferring stock, entrance fees, and
  any other revenues or payments,&mdash;all of which go into the common
  treasury. When the instalment payments and profits of all kinds equal the
  face value of all the shares issued, the assets, over and above expenses
  and losses, are apportioned among members, and this apportionment cancels
  the borrower's debt, while the non-borrower is given the amount of his
  stock. A man who wishes to borrow, let us say, $1000 for the erection of
  a house ordinarily takes five shares in an association, each of which,
  when he has paid all the successive instalments on it, will be worth
  $200, and he must offer suitable security for his loan, usually the lot
  on which he is to build. The money is not lent to him at regular rates of
  interest, as in the case of a savings bank or other financial
  institution, but is put up at auction usually in open meeting at the time
  of the payment of dues, and is awarded to the member bidding the highest
  premium. To secure the $1000 borrowed, the member gives the association a
  mortgage on his property and pledges his five shares of stock. Some
  associations, when the demand for money from the shareholders does not
  exhaust the surplus, lend their funds to persons not shareholders, upon
  such terms and conditions as may be approved by their directors. Herein
  lies a danger, for such loans are sometimes made in a speculative way, or
  on insufficient land value. Some associations make stock loans, or loans
  on the shares held by a stockholder without real estate security; these
  vary in different associations, some applying the same rules as to real
  estate loans. To cancel his debt the stockholder is constantly paying his
  monthly or semi-monthly dues, until such time as these payments, plus the
  accumulation of profits through compound interest, mature the shares at
  $200 each, when he surrenders his shares, and the debt upon his property
  is cancelled.</p>

  <p>Every member of a building and loan association must be a stockholder,
  and the amount of interest which a member has in a <span
  class="sidenote">Shares.</span> building and loan association is
  indicated by the number of shares he holds, the age of the shares, and
  their maturing value. The difference between a stockholder in such an
  association and one in an ordinary corporation for usual business
  purposes lies in the fact that in the latter the member or stockholder
  buys his stock and pays for it at once, and as a rule is not called upon
  for further payment; all profits on such stocks are received through
  dividends, the value of shares depending upon the successful operation of
  the business. In the former the stockholder or member pays a stipulated
  minimum sum, say $1, when he takes his membership and buys a share of
  stock. He continues to pay a like sum each month until the aggregate of
  sums paid, increased by the profits and all other sources of income,
  amounts to the maturing value of the stock, usually $200, when the
  stockholder is entitled to the full maturing value of the share and
  surrenders the same. Shares are usually issued in series. When a second
  series is issued the issue of the stock of the first series ceases.
  Profits are distributed and losses apportioned before a new series can be
  issued. The term during which a series is open for subscription differs,
  but it usually extends over three or six months, and sometimes a year.
  Some associations, usually known as perpetual associations, issue a new
  series of stock without regard to the time of maturity of previous
  issues. It is the practice in such associations to issue a new series of
  stock every year. Instead of shares that are paid in instalments, some
  associations issue prepaid shares and paid-up shares. <i>Prepaid
  shares</i>, known also as partly paid-up shares, are issued at a fixed
  price per share in advance. They usually participate as fully in the
  profits as the regular instalment shares, and when the amount originally
  paid for such shares, together with the dividends accrued thereon,
  reaches the maturing or par value, they are disposed of in the same
  manner as regular instalment shares. Some associations, instead of
  crediting all the profits made on this class of shares, allow a fixed
  rate of interest on the amount paid therefor at each dividend period,
  which is paid in cash to the holder thereof. This interest is then
  deducted from the profits to which the shares are entitled, and the
  remainder is credited to the shares until such unpaid portion of the
  profits, added to the amount originally paid, equals the maturing or par
  value. <i>Paid-up shares</i> are issued upon the payment of the full
  maturity or par value, when a certificate of paid-up stock is issued, the
  owners being entitled to receive in cash the amount of all dividends
  declared thereon, subject to such conditions or limitations as may be
  agreed upon. These shares sometimes participate as fully in the profits
  as the regular instalment shares, but in most cases a fixed rate of
  interest only is allowed, the holders of the shares usually assigning to
  the association all right to profits above that amount. Certificates of
  matured shares are also issued to holders of regular instalment shares,
  who prefer to leave their money with the association as an
  investment.</p>

  <p>Prior to the maturing of a share it has two values, the holding or
  book value and the withdrawal value. The book value is ascertained by
  adding all the dues that have been paid to the profits that have accrued;
  that is to say, it is the actual value of a share at any particular time.
  The withdrawal value is that amount of the book value which the
  association is willing to pay to a shareholder who desires to sever his
  connexion with the association before his share is matured. Some
  associations do not permit their members to withdraw prior to the
  maturing of their shares. Then the only way a shareholder can realize
  upon his shares is by selling them to some other person at whatever price
  he can obtain. There are twelve or more plans for the withdrawal of
  funds. Every association has full regulations on all such matters.</p>

  <p>The purchase of a share binds the shareholder to the necessity of
  keeping up his dues, and thus secures to him not only the benefits <span
  class="sidenote">Variations in methods.</span> of a savings bank, but the
  benefit of constantly accruing compound interest. This accomplishes the
  first feature of the motive of a building and loan association. The
  second is accomplished by enabling a man to borrow money for building
  purposes. It is a moot question whether this method of obtaining money
  for the building of homes is more or less economical than that of
  obtaining it from the ordinary savings banks or from other sources.
  Sometimes the premium which must be paid to secure a loan increases the
  regular interest to such an amount as to make the building and loan
  method more expensive than the ordinary method of borrowing money, but a
  building and loan association has a moral influence upon its members, in
  that it encourages a regular payment of instalments. Some associations
  have a fixed or established premium rate, and under such circumstances
  loans are awarded to the members in the order of their applications or by
  lot. The premium may consist of the amount which the borrower pays in
  excess of the legal interest, or it may consist of a certain number of
  payments of dues or of interest to be made in advance. There are very
  many plans for the payment of premiums, nearly seventy relating to real
  estate loans being in vogue in different associations in different parts
  of the United States; but in nearly all cases the borrower makes his
  regular payments of dues and interest until the shares pledged have
  reached maturing value. There is also a great variety of plans for the
  distribution of profits, something like twenty-five such plans being in
  existence. The methods of calculating interest and profits are somewhat
  complicated, but they are all found in the books to which reference will
  be made. The various plans for the payment of premiums, distribution of
  profits, and withdrawals, and the calculations under each, are given in
  full in the ninth annual report of the U.S. commissioner of labour.</p>

  <p>Most building and loan associations confine their operations to a
  small community, usually to the county in which they are situated; but
  some of them operate on a large scale, extending their business
  enterprises even beyond the borders of their own state. These national
  associations are ready to make loans on property anywhere, and sell their
  shares to any person without reference to his residence. In local
  associations the total amount of dues paid in by the shareholders forms
  the basis for the distribution of profits, while in most national
  associations only a portion of the dues paid in by the shareholders is
  considered in the distribution. For instance, in a national association
  the dues are generally 60 cents a share per month, out of which either 8
  or 10 cents are carried to an expense fund, the remainder being credited
  on the loan fund. The expense fund thus created is lost to the
  shareholders, except in the case of a few associations which carry the
  unexpended balances to the profit and loss account, and whatever profits
  are made are apportioned on the amount of dues credited to the loan fund
  only. The creation of an expense fund in the nationals has sometimes been
  the source of disaster. Safety or security in both local and national
  associations depends principally upon the integrity with which their
  affairs are conducted, and not so much upon the form of organization or
  the method of distribution. Some of the states&mdash;New York,
  Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, California and
  others&mdash;bring building and loan associations under the same general
  supervision of law thrown around savings banks. In some states nothing is
  officially known of them beyond the formalities of their incorporation.
  Though the business of the associations is conducted by men not trained
  as bankers, it yet meets with rare success. Associations disband when not
  successful, but when they disband great loss does not occur because the
  whole business of the association consists of its loans, and these loans
  are to its own shareholders, as a rule, who hold the securities in their
  associated forms. The amount of money on hand is always small, because it
  is sold or lent as fast as paid in. A disbanded association, therefore,
  simply returns to its own members their own property, and but few real
  losses occur. Investment in a building and loan association is as nearly
  absolutely <!-- Page 770 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page770"></a>[v.04 p.0770]</span>safe as it can be, for the monthly
  dues and the accumulated profits, which give the actual capital of the
  association, are lent or sold, as it is termed, by the association as
  fast as they accumulate, and upon real estate or upon the stock of the
  association itself. The opportunities for embezzlement, therefore, or for
  shrinkage of securities, are reduced to the minimum, and an almost
  absolute safety of the investment is secured.</p>

  <p>The growth of these associations has been very rapid since 1840, and
  at the opening of the 20th century they numbered nearly 6000. The Federal
  government, through the department of labour, made an investigation of
  building and loan associations, and published its report in 1893. The
  total dues paid in on instalment shares amounted then to $450,667,594.
  The business represented by this great sum, conducted quietly, with
  little or no advertising, and without the experienced banker in charge,
  shows that the common people, in their own ways, are quite competent to
  take care of their savings, especially when it was shown that but
  thirty-five of the associations then in existence met with a net loss at
  the end of their latest fiscal year, and that this loss amounted to only
  a little over $23,000. Bulletin No. 10 (May 1897) of the U.S. department
  of labour contained a calculation of the business at that date, based
  upon such states' reports as were available. That calculation showed a
  growth in almost every item. During the years of depression ending with
  1899 the growth of building and loan associations was naturally slower
  than in prosperous periods.</p>

  <p><b>BUILTH,</b> or <span class="sc">Builth Wells</span>, a market town
  of Brecknockshire, Wales. Pop. of urban district (1901), 1805. It has a
  station on the Cambrian line between Moat Lane and Brecon, and two others
  (high and low levels) at Builth Road about 1¾ m. distant where the London
  &amp; North-Western and the Cambrian cross one another. It is pleasantly
  situated in the upper valley of the Wye, in a bend of the river on its
  right bank below the confluence of its tributary the Irfon. During the
  summer it is a place of considerable resort for the sake of its
  waters&mdash;saline, chalybeate and sulphur&mdash;and it possesses the
  usual accessories of pump-rooms, baths and a recreation ground. The
  scenery of the Wye valley, including a succession of rapids just above
  the town, also attracts many tourists. The town is an important
  agricultural centre, its fairs for sheep and ponies in particular being
  well attended.</p>

  <p>The town, called in Welsh Llanfair (yn) Muallt, i.e. St Mary's in
  Builth, took its name from the ancient territorial division of Buallt in
  which it is situated, which was, according to Nennius, an independent
  principality in the beginning of the 9th century, and later a cantrev,
  corresponding to the modern hundred of Builth. Towards the end of the
  11th century, when the tide of Norman invasion swept upwards along the
  Wye valley, the district became a lordship marcher annexed to that of
  Brecknock, but was again severed from it on the death of William de
  Breos, when his daughter Matilda brought it to her husband, Roger
  Mortimer of Wigmore. Its castle, built probably in Newmarch's time, or
  shortly after, was the most advanced outpost of the invaders in a wild
  part of Wales where the tendency to revolt was always strong. It was
  destroyed in 1260 by Llewellyn ab Gruffydd, prince of Wales, with the
  supposed connivance of Mortimer, but its site was reoccupied by the earl
  of Lincoln in 1277, and a new castle at once erected. It was with the
  expectation that he might, with local aid, seize the castle, that
  Llewellyn invaded this district in December 1282, when he was surprised
  and killed by Stephen de Frankton in a ravine called Cwm Llewellyn on the
  left bank of the Irfon, 2½ m. from the town. According to local tradition
  he was buried at Cefn-y-bedd ("the ridge of the grave") close by, but it
  is more likely that his headless trunk was taken to Abbey Cwmhir. No
  other important event was associated with the castle, of which not a
  stone is now standing. The lordship remained in the marches till the Act
  of Union 1536, when it was grouped with a number of others so as to form
  the shire of Brecknock. The town was governed by a local board from 1866
  until the establishment of an urban district council in 1894; the urban
  district was then made conterminous with the civil parish, and in 1898 it
  was re-named Builth Wells.</p>

  <p><b>BUISSON, FERDINAND</b> (1841- ), French educationalist, was born at
  Paris on the 20th of December 1841. In 1868, when attached to the
  teaching staff of the Academy of Geneva, he obtained a philosophical
  fellowship. In 1870 he settled in Paris, and in the following year was
  nominated an inspector of primary education. His appointment was,
  however, strongly opposed by the bishop of Orleans (who saw danger to
  clerical influence over the schools), and the nomination was cancelled.
  But the bishop's action only served to draw attention to Buisson's
  abilities. He was appointed secretary of the statistical commission on
  primary education, and sent as a delegate to the Vienna exhibition of
  1873, and the Philadelphia exhibition of 1876. In 1878 he was instructed
  to report on the educational section of the Paris exhibition, and in the
  same year was appointed inspector-general of primary education. In 1879
  he was promoted to the directorship of primary education, a post which he
  occupied until 1896, when he became professor of education at the
  Sorbonne. At the general election of 1902 he was returned to the chamber
  of deputies as a radical socialist by the XIII<sup>me</sup>
  arrondissement of Paris. He supported the policy of M. Combes, and
  presided over the commission for the separation of church and state.</p>

  <p><b>BUITENZORG,</b> a hill station in the residency of Batavia, island
  of Java, Dutch East Indies. It is beautifully situated among the hills at
  the foot of the Salak volcano, about 860 ft. above sea-level, and has a
  cool and healthy climate. Buitenzorg is the usual residence of the
  governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, and is further remarkable on
  account of its splendid botanical garden and for its popularity as a
  health resort. The botanic gardens are among the finest in the world;
  they originally formed a part of the park attached to the palace of the
  governor-general, and were established in 1817. Under J.S. Teysmann, who
  became <i>hortulanus</i> in 1830, the collection was extended, and in
  1868 was recognized as a government institution with a director. Between
  this and 1880 a museum, a school of agriculture, and a culture garden
  were added, and since then library, botanical, chemical, and
  pharmacological laboratories, and a herbarium have been established. The
  palace of the governor-general was founded by Governor-General van Imhoff
  in 1744, and rebuilt after being destroyed by an earthquake in 1834.
  Buitenzorg is also the seat of the general secretary of the state railway
  and of the department of mines. Buitenzorg, which is called Bogor by the
  natives, was once the capital of the princess of Pajajaram. Close by, at
  <i>Bata Tulis</i> ("inscribed stone"), are some Hindu remains. The
  district of Buitenzorg (till 1866 an assistant residency) forms the
  southern part of the residency of Batavia, with an area of 1447 sq. m. It
  occupies the northern slopes of a range of hills separating it from
  Preanger, and has a fertile soil. Tea, coffee, cinchona, sugar-cane,
  rice, nutmegs, cloves and pepper are cultivated.</p>

  was Buzinjird, and thus it still appears in official registers. It is the
  chief place of the district of same name, which extends in the west to
  the borders of Shahrud and Astarabad; in the north it is bounded by
  Russian Transcaspia, in the east by Kuchan, and in the south by Jovain.

  <p><b>BUKH&#x100;R&#x12A;</b> [Mahommed ibn Ism&#x101;'&#x12B;l
  al-Bukh&#x101;r&#x12B;] (810-872), Arabic author of the most generally
  accepted collection of traditions (<span class="special"
  title="hadith"><i>&#x1E25;ad&#x12B;th</i></span>) from Mahomet, was born
  at Bokhara (<i>Bukh&#x101;r&#x101;</i>), of an Iranian family, in <span
  class="scac">A.H.</span> 194 (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 810). He
  early distinguished himself in the learning of traditions by heart, and
  when, in his sixteenth year, his family made the pilgrimage to Mecca, he
  gathered additions to his store from the authorities along the route.
  Already, in his eighteenth year, he had devoted himself to the
  collecting, sifting, testing and arranging of traditions. For that
  purpose he travelled over the Moslem world, from Egypt to Samarkand, and
  learned (as the story goes) from over a thousand men three hundred
  thousand traditions, true and false. He certainly became the acknowledged
  authority on the subject, and developed a power and speed of memory <!--
  Page 771 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page771"></a>[v.04
  p.0771]</span>which seemed miraculous, even to his contemporaries. His
  theological position was conservative and anti-rationalistic; he enjoyed
  the friendship and respect of <span class="special" title="Ahmad Ibn Hanbal"
  >A&#x1E25;mad Ibn &#x1E24;anbal</span>. In law, he appears to have been a
  Sh&#x101;fi'ite. After sixteen years' absence he returned to Bokhara, and
  there drew up his <span class="special"
  title="Sahih"><i>&#x1E62;a&#x1E25;&#x12B;&#x1E25;</i></span>, a
  collection of 7275 tested traditions, arranged in chapters so as to
  afford bases for a complete system of jurisprudence without the use of
  speculative law, the first book of its kind (see <span
  class="sc">Mahommedan Law</span>). He died in <span
  class="scac">A.H.</span> 256, in banishment at Kartank, a suburb of
  Samarkand. His book has attained a quasi-canonicity in Isl&#x101;m, being
  treated almost like the Koran, and to his grave solemn pilgrimages are
  made, and prayers are believed to be heard there.</p>

  <p><b>BUKOVINA,</b> a duchy and crownland of Austria, bounded E. by
  Russia and Rumania, S. by Rumania, W. by Transylvania and Hungary, and N.
  by Galicia. Area, 4035 sq. m. The country, especially in its southern
  parts, is occupied by the offshoots of the Carpathians, which attain in
  the Giumaleu an altitude of 6100 ft. The principal passes are the Radna
  Pass and the Borgo Pass. With the exception of the Dniester, which skirts
  its northern border, Bukovina belongs to the watershed of the Danube. The
  principal rivers are the Pruth, and the Sereth with its affluents the
  Suczawa, the Moldava and the Bistritza. The climate of Bukovina is
  healthy but severe, especially in winter; but it is generally milder than
  that of Galicia, the mean annual temperature at Czernowitz being 46.9° F.
  No less than 43.17% of the total area is occupied by woodland, and the
  very name of the country is derived from the abundance of beech trees. Of
  the remainder 27.59% is occupied by arable land, 12.68% by meadows,
  10.09% by pastures and 0.78% by gardens. The soil of Bukovina is fertile,
  and agriculture has made great progress, the principal products being
  wheat, maize, rye, oats, barley, potatoes, flax and hemp. Cattle-rearing
  constitutes another important source of revenue. The principal mineral is
  salt, which is extracted at the mine of Kaczyka, belonging to the
  government. Brewing, distilling and milling are the chief industries.
  Commerce is mostly in the hands of the Jews and Armenians, and chiefly
  confined to raw products, such as agricultural produce, cattle, wool and
  wood. Bukovina had in 1900 a population of 729,921, which is equivalent
  to 181 inhabitants per sq. m. According to nationality, over 40% were
  Ruthenians, 35% Rumanians, 13% Jews, and the remainder was composed of
  Germans, Poles, Hungarians, Russians and Armenians. The official language
  of the administration, of the law-courts, and of instruction in the
  university is German. Nearly 70% of the population belong to the Greek
  Orthodox Church, and stand under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the
  archbishop or metropolitan of Czernowitz. To the Roman Catholic Church
  belong 11%, to the Greek United Church 3.25%, while 2.5% are Protestants.
  Elementary education is improving, but, after Dalmatia, Bukovina still
  shows the largest number of illiterates in Austria. The local diet, of
  which the archbishop of Czernowitz and the rector of the university are
  members <i>ex officio</i>, is composed of 31 members, and Bukovina sends
  14 deputies to the Reichsrat at Vienna. For administrative purposes, the
  country is divided into 9 districts and an autonomous municipality,
  Czernowitz (pop. 69,619), the capital. Other towns are Radautz (14,343),
  Suczawa (10,946), Kuczurmare (9417), Kimpolung (8024) and Sereth
  (7610).</p>

  <p>Bukovina was originally a part of the principality of Moldavia, whose
  ancient capital Suczawa was situated in this province. It was occupied by
  the Russians in 1769, and by the Austrians in 1774. In 1777 the Porte,
  under whose suzerainty Moldavia was, ceded this province to Austria. It
  was incorporated with Galicia in a single province in 1786, but was
  separated from it in 1849, and made a separate crownland.</p>

  <p><b>BULACÁN,</b> a town of the province of Bulacán, Luzon, Philippine
  Islands, on an arm of the Pampanga delta, 22 m. N.N.W. of Manila. Pop.
  (1903) 11,589; after the census enumeration, the town of Guiguintó (pop.
  3948) was annexed. Bulacán is served by the Manila-Dagupan railway.
  Sugar, rice, indigo and tropical fruits are the chief products of the
  fertile district in which the town lies; it is widely known for its
  fish-ponds and its excellent fish, and its principal manufactures are
  jusi, piña, ilang ilang perfume and sugar. With the exception of the
  churches and a few stone buildings, Bulacán was completely destroyed by
  fire in 1898.</p>

  <p><b>BULANDSHAHR,</b> a town and district of British India in the Meerut
  division of the United Provinces. The town is situated on a height on the
  right bank of the Kali-Nadi, whence the substitution of the names
  Unchanagar and Bulandshahr (high town) for its earlier name of Baran, by
  which it is still sometimes called. The population in 1901 was 18,959.
  Its present handsome appearance is due to several successive collectors,
  notably F.S. Growse, who was active in erecting public buildings, and in
  encouraging the local gentry to beautify their own houses. In particular,
  it boasts a fine bathing-ghat, a town-hall, a market-place, a tank to
  supply water, and a public garden.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">District of Bulandshahr</span> has an area of
  1899 sq. m. The district stretches out in a level plain, with a gentle
  slope from N.W. to S.E., and a gradual but very slight elevation about
  midway between the Ganges and Jumna. Principal rivers are the Ganges and
  Jumna&mdash;the former navigable all the year round, the latter only
  during the rains. The Ganges canal intersects the district, and serves
  both for irrigation and navigation. The Lower Ganges canal has its
  headworks at Narora. The climate of the district is liable to extremes,
  being very cold in the winter and excessively hot in the summer. In 1901
  the population was 1,138,101, showing an increase of 20% in the decade.
  The district is very highly cultivated and thickly populated. There are
  several indigo factories, and mills for pressing and cleaning cotton, but
  the former have greatly suffered by the decline in indigo of recent
  years. The main line of the East Indian railway and the Oudh and
  Rohilkhand railway cross the district. The chief centre of trade is
  Khurja.</p>

  <p>Nothing certain is known of the history of the district before <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1018, when Mahmud of Ghazni appeared before
  Baran and received the submission of the Hindu raja and his followers to
  Islam. In 1193 the city was captured by Kutb-ud-din. In the 14th century
  the district was subject to invasions of Rajput and Mongol clans who left
  permanent settlements in the country. With the firm establishment of the
  Mogul empire peace was restored, the most permanent effect of this period
  being the large proportion of Mussulmans among the population, due to the
  zeal of Aurangzeb. The decline of the Mogul empire gave free play to the
  turbulent spirit of the Jats and Gujars, many of whose chieftains
  succeeded in carving out petty principalities for themselves at the
  expense of their neighbours. During this period, however, Baran had
  properly no separate history, being a dependency of Koil, whence it
  continued to be administered under the Mahratta domination. After Koil
  and the fort of Aligarh had been captured by the British in 1803,
  Bulandshahr and the surrounding country were at first incorporated in the
  newly created district of Aligarh (1805). Bulandshahr enjoyed an evil
  reputation in the Mutiny of 1857, when the Gujar peasantry plundered the
  towns. The Jats took the side of the government, while the Gujars and
  Mussulman Rajputs were most actively hostile.</p>

  <p><b>BULAWAYO,</b> the capital of Matabeleland, the western province of
  southern Rhodesia, South Africa. White population (1904) 3840. It
  occupies a central position on the tableland between the Limpopo and
  Zambezi rivers, is 4469 ft. above the sea and 1362 m. north-east of Cape
  Town by rail. Beira, the nearest port, is 398 m. east in a direct line,
  but distant 675 m. by railway. Another railway, part of the Cape to Cairo
  connexion, runs north-west from Bulawayo, crossing the Zambezi just below
  the Victoria Falls. In the centre of the town is a large market square to
  which roads lead in regular lines north, south, east and <!-- Page 772
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page772"></a>[v.04 p.0772]</span>west.
  Those going east and west are called avenues and are numbered, those
  running north and south are called streets and are named. Through the
  centre of Market Square runs Rhodes Street. There are many handsome
  public and private buildings. In front of the stock exchange is a
  monument in memory of the 257 settlers killed in the Matabele rebellion
  of 1896, and at the junction of two of the principal streets is a
  colossal bronze statue of Cecil Rhodes. East of the town is a large park
  and botanical gardens, beyond which is a residential suburb. The railway
  station and water and electric supply works are in the south-west
  quarter. An avenue 130 ft. broad and nearly 1½ m. long, planted
  throughout its length with trees, leads from the town to Government
  House, which is built on the site of Lobengula's royal kraal. The tree
  under which that chieftain sat when giving judgment has been preserved. A
  number of gold reefs intersect the surrounding district and in some of
  the reefs gold is mined. South-south-east of the town are the Matoppo
  Hills. In a grave in one of these hills, 33 m. from Bulawayo, Rhodes is
  buried.</p>

  <p>The "Place of Slaughter," as the Zulu word Bulawayo is interpreted,
  was founded about 1838 by Lobengula's father, Mosilikatze, some distance
  south of the present town, and continued to be the royal residence till
  its occupation by the British South Africa Company's forces in November
  1893, when a new town was founded. Four years later the railway
  connecting it with Cape Town was completed (see <span
  class="sc">Rhodesia</span>).</p>

  <p><b>BULDANA,</b> a town and district of India, in Berar. The town had a
  population in 1901 of 4137. The district has an area of 3662 sq. m. The
  southern part forms a portion of Berar Balaghat or Berar&mdash;above the
  Ghats. Here the general contour of the country may be described as a
  succession of small plateaus decreasing in elevation to the extreme
  south. Towards the eastern side of the district the country assumes more
  the character of undulating high lands, favoured with soil of a good
  quality. A succession of plateaus descends from the highest ridges on the
  north to the south, where a series of small ghats march with the nizam's
  territory. The small fertile valleys between the plateaus are watered by
  streams during the greater portion of the year, while wells of
  particularly good and pure water are numerous. These valleys are
  favourite village sites. The north portion of the district occupies the
  rich valley of the Purna. The district is rich in agricultural produce;
  in a seasonable year a many-coloured sheet of cultivation, almost without
  a break, covers the valley of the Purna. In the Balaghat also the crops
  are very fine. Situated as the district is in the neighbourhood of the
  great cotton market of Khamgaon, and nearer to Bombay than the other
  Berar districts, markets for its agricultural produce on favourable terms
  are easily found. In 1901 the population was 423,616, showing a decrease
  of 12% in the decade due to the effects of famine. The district was
  reconstituted, and given an additional area of 853 sq. m. in 1905; the
  population on the enlarged area in 1901 was 613,756. The only manufacture
  is cotton cloth. Cotton, wheat and oil-seeds are largely exported. The
  Nagpur line of the Great Indian Peninsula railway runs through the north
  of the district. The most important place of trade is Malkapur&mdash;pop.
  (1901) 13,112&mdash;with several factories for ginning and pressing
  cotton.</p>

  <p><b>BULDUR,</b> or <span class="sc">Burdur</span>, chief town of a

  <i>Polydorion</i>. Its altitude is 3150 ft. and it is situated in the
  midst of gardens, about 2 m. from the brackish lake, Buldur Geul (anc.
  <i>Ascania Limne</i>). Linen-weaving and leather-tanning are the
  principal industries. There is a good carriage road to Dineir, by which
  much grain is sent from the Buldur plain, and a railway connects it with
  Dineir and Egirdir. Pop. 12,000.</p>

  <p><b>BULFINCH, CHARLES</b> (1763-1844), American architect, was born in
  Boston, Massachusetts, on the 8th of August 1763, the son of Thomas
  Bulfinch, a prominent and wealthy physician. He was educated at the
  Boston Latin school and at Harvard, where he graduated in 1781, and after
  several years of travel and study in Europe, settled in 1787 in Boston,
  where he was the first to practise as a professional architect. Among his
  early works were the old Federal Street theatre (1793), the first
  play-house in New England, and the "new" State House (1798). For more
  than twenty-five years he was the most active architect in Boston, and at
  the same time took a leading part in the public life of the city. As
  chairman of the board of selectmen for twenty-one years (1797-1818), an
  important position which made him practically chief magistrate, he
  exerted a strong influence in modernizing Boston, in providing for new
  systems of drainage and street-lighting, in reorganizing the police and
  fire departments, and in straightening and widening the streets. He was
  one of the promoters in 1787 of the voyage of the ship "Columbia," which
  under command of Captain Robert Gray (1755-1806) was the first to carry
  the American flag round the world. In 1818 Bulfinch succeeded B.H.
  Latrobe (1764-1820) as architect of the National Capitol at Washington.
  He completed the unfinished wings and central portion, constructing the
  rotunda from plans of his own after suggestions of his predecessor, and
  designed the new western approach and portico. In 1830 he returned to
  Boston, where he died on the 15th of April 1844. Bulfinch's work was
  marked by sincerity, simplicity, refinement of taste and an entire
  freedom from affectation, and it greatly influenced American architecture
  in the early formative period. His son, Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch
  (1809-1870), was a well-known Unitarian clergyman and author.</p>

  <p><b>BULGARIA,</b> a kingdom of south-eastern Europe, situated in the
  north-east of the Balkan Peninsula, and on the Black Sea. From 1878 until
  the 5th of October 1908, Bulgaria was an autonomous and tributary
  principality, under the suzerainty of the sultan of Turkey. The area of
  the kingdom amounts to 37,240 sq. m., and comprises the territories
  between the Balkan chain and the river Danube; the province of Eastern
  Rumelia, lying south of the Balkans; and the western highlands of
  Kiustendil, Samakov, Sofia and Trn. Bulgaria is bounded on the N. by the
  Danube, from its confluence with the Timok to the eastern suburbs of
  Silistria whence a line, forming the Rumanian frontier, is drawn to a
  point on the Black Sea coast 10 m. S. of Mangalia. On the E. it is washed
  by the Black Sea; on the S. the Turkish frontier, starting from a point
  on the coast about 12 m. S. of Sozopolis, runs in a south-westerly
  direction, crossing the river Maritza at Mustafa Pasha, and reaching the
  Arda at Adakali. The line laid down by the Berlin Treaty (1878) ascended
  the Arda to Ishiklar, thence following the crest of Rhodope to the
  westwards, but the cantons of Krjali and Rupchus included in this
  boundary were restored to Turkey in 1886. The present frontier, passing
  to the north of these districts, reaches the watershed of Rhodope a
  little north of the Dospat valley, and then follows the crest of the
  Rilska Planina to the summit of Tchrni Vrkh, where the Servian, Turkish
  and Bulgarian territories meet. From this point the western or Servian
  frontier passes northwards, leaving Trn to the east and Pirot to the
  west, reaching the Timok near Kula, and following the course of that
  river to its junction with the Danube. The Berlin Treaty boundary was far
  from corresponding with the ethnological limits of the Bulgarian race,
  which were more accurately defined by the abrogated treaty of San Stefano
  (see below, under <i>History</i>). A considerable portion of Macedonia,
  the districts of Pirot and Vranya belonging to Servia, the northern half
  of the vilayet of Adrianople, and large tracts of the Dobrudja, are,
  according to the best and most impartial authorities, mainly inhabited by
  a Bulgarian population.</p>

  <p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;The most striking physical features
  are two mountain-chains; the Balkans, which run east and west through the
  heart of the country; and Rhodope, which, for a considerable distance,
  forms its southern boundary. The Balkans constitute the southern half of
  the great semicircular range known as the anti-Dacian system, of which
  the Carpathians form the northern portion. This great chain is sundered
  at the Iron Gates by the passage of the Danube; its two component parts
  present many points of resemblance in their aspect and outline,
  geological formation and flora. The Balkans (ancient <i>Haemus</i>) run
  almost parallel to the Danube, ...</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
